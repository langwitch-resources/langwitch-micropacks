He did more.	Wax ka badan wuu sameeyay.
And there was better luck to come.	Oo waxaa jiray nasiib ka wanaagsan inuu yimaado.
There is nothing more difficult.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii adag.
I have never seen that before and I am very surprised.	Taas hore uma arag oo aad baan ula yaabay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I think tonight is one of them.	Waxaan filayaa in caawa ay ka mid tahay.
I did not want to be here.	Ma aanan rabin in aan halkaan joogo.
She would do this.	Waxay samayn lahayd tan.
In fact, he is not a very good man.	Run ahaantii, maaha nin aad u fiican.
Supposedly works.	Loo malaynayo inuu shaqeeyo.
I'm just glad you had time.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaad waqti heli karto.
I would tell him at the door.	Waxaan uga sheegi lahaa albaabka.
He posted another.	Mid kale ayuu soo dhigay.
I do not like to see what is happening now.	Ma jecli inaan arko waxa hadda jira.
I felt very little.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u yar.
Even if you are alone.	Xitaa haddii aad keligaa tahay.
Really, this is what we really do.	Runtii, tani waa waxa aan dhab ahaantii samayno.
Just too big.	Kaliya aad uga weyn.
Ideally, this would be awful.	Fikrad ahaan, tani waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
For a while you did not see him.	In muddo ah ma aadan arag isaga.
Obviously, this will take time.	Sida cad, tani waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
I will get a job.	Waxaan heli doonaa shaqo.
But nothing came of it.	Laakiin waxba uma iman.
I was told not to speak.	Ha hadlin baa la igu yidhi.
No one had any money.	Qofna wax lacag ah ma haysan.
And there is more.	Oo wax badan ayaa jira.
I would do so.	sidaas ayaan yeeli lahaa.
Something is happening to you	Wax baa kugu socda
From	Ka socda
I love that, too.	Waan jeclahay taas, sidoo kale.
No one else spoke.	Qof kale ma hadlin.
I want to stay with him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan isaga la sii joogo.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
It will be good to know how to do it.	Way fiicnaan doontaa in la ogaado sida loo sameeyo.
Even now he may be doing so.	Xitaa hadda waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidaas samaynayo.
I hope he has.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu leeyahay.
I am serious.	dhab baan ahay.
It's hard to get out.	Way adag tahay in laga baxo.
Him	Isaga
I was still in school.	Weli waxaan ku jiray dugsiga.
Not for long, he said.	In muddo ah ma aha, ayuu yidhi.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I should have.	Waxay ahayd inaan haysto.
It was more than an idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad ka badan.
I do not understand this.	Ma fahmin tan.
I just want to go out and do it.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan baxo oo sameeyo.
But so far nothing has happened.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax dhacay.
I like to do anything fun.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan sameeyo wax kasta oo xiiso leh.
I would definitely go back	Hubaal waan ku noqon lahaa
He was the only one I didn't have.	Wuxuu ahaa ka kaliya ee aan haysan.
You do not need.	Uma baahnid .
It was not as if he had many friends.	Ma ahayn sida inuu lahaa saaxiibo badan.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
She can still do that.	Weli way samayn kartaa taas.
Hold on.	Qabo .
It was not a good thing.	Wax wanaagsan ma ahayn.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
I don’t know if that will do the job, but it could happen.	Ma garanayo inay taasi qaban doonto shaqada, laakiin way dhici kartaa.
I thought this was right.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay sax ahayd.
I could not let him go.	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu baxo.
There was nothing else to do.	Ma jirin wax kale oo la sameeyo.
This may not be so true.	Tani run badan kama noqon karto.
Here it is !.	Waa kan!.
Not so now.	Hadda sidaas maaha.
Do not think that you can handle it.	Ha u malayn inaad ka bixi karto.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
And there is certainly nothing new.	Oo hubaal ma jiraan wax cusub oo cusub.
He will hurt you.	Wuu ku yeeli doonaa.
But there was more.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
I saw that it was not.	Waxaan arkay in aanay ahayn.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
You will go to school.	Waxaad aadi doontaa dugsiga.
Just give it time.	Kaliya sii waqti.
I had no idea you would see it that way.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaad sidaas u arki doonto.
Nice to see you too.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko sidoo kale.
It needs a lot.	Wax badan bay u baahan tahay.
It was a difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag.
So far, she has not received it.	Ilaa hadda, ma aysan helin.
Maybe he has nowhere else to go.	Malaha meel kale oo uu aado malaha.
I hope it is not.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan ahayn.
you are too early.	goor hore ayaad tahay.
It does not end there.	Halkaas kuma eka.
So does everyone else.	Sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale.
I have gone, like, three times now.	Waxaan tagay, sida, saddex jeer hadda.
They are the driving force.	Waa dadka wax wada.
I am here.	halkaan ayaan u joogaa.
He asked me.	Wuxuu iga codsaday.
Anything.	Wax ka mid ah.
Now I know what it is.	Hadda waan garanayaa waxa ay tahay.
Something real.	Wax dhab ah.
They will tell you what cannot be done, and why.	Waxay kuu sheegi doonaan waxa aan la samayn karin, iyo sababta.
There is good money to be made there.	Waxaa jira lacag fiican oo lagu sameeyo halkaas.
It will only get better.	Kaliya way fiicnaan doontaa.
A lot to do here.	Wax badan oo lagu sameeyo halkan.
Don't do that.	Ha samayn taas.
And I have a job.	Oo waxaan leeyahay shaqo.
He did well.	Si fiican ayuu u sameeyay.
It can not help.	Ma caawin karto.
I know this.	Waan ogahay tan.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab .
I had a good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican.
This is, for me, a problem.	Tani waa, aniga, dhibaato.
They are still not correct.	Wali sax ma yihiin.
Have you said anything yet?	Weli wax ma sheegtay?
I don't have time for that right now.	Waqti uma hayo taas hadda.
This is a false lie.	Tani waa been aan run ahayn.
I really want him here.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inuu halkaan joogo.
To do something.	Si wax loo sameeyo.
He got the best job.	Waxa uu helay shaqada ugu fiican.
One by one.	Mid ilaa mid.
Something else is coming.	Wax kale ayaa soo socda.
But there was no time to talk about this.	Laakiin ma jirin wakhti arrintan laga hadlo.
There was so much.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
Either way it will happen.	Si kasta oo ay tahay taasi way dhici doontaa.
He thought he knew it now.	Wuxuu mooday inuu hadda sidaas garanayo.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
He appeared at the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka soo muuqday.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado.
He did not speak for a long time.	Muddo dheer ma uu hadlin.
Tomorrow will be better today, for sure.	Berrito maanta way ka fiicnaan doontaa, waa hubaal.
I have no money now.	Wax lacag ah ma haysto hadda.
It just isn't the same.	Kaliya waxba isku mid ma aha.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
he is very smart	wuu caqli badan yahay
He needs to do something about it.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu wax ka sameeyo.
I hope it is.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay tahay.
It does not have to be learned.	Ma aha in la barto.
But there is something he can not get out of here yet.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax uusan weli ka bixi karin halkan.
But there is good sense too.	Laakiin waxaa jira caqli wanaagsan sidoo kale.
I can't even say it again.	Xitaa dib uma sheegi karo.
I am happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
How beautiful you are tonight.	Sidee u qurux badan tahay caawa.
I just want to know where it came from.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado meesha uu ka yimid.
Not everyone can do it.	Qof kastaa ma samayn karo.
The only thing is.	Waxa kaliya ayaa ah.
That will always be true.	Taasi mar walba run bay ahaan doontaa.
It is as he wanted it to be.	Waa sidii uu rabay.
It is the same.	Waa isku mid.
And you did the only thing you knew to do.	Oo waxaad samaysay waxa kaliya ee aad ogaatay inaad samayso.
He said well.	Si fiican buu u yidhi.
He thought it would be so.	Wuxuu mooday inay sidaas noqon doonto.
Today, everyone does everything.	Maanta, qof kastaa wax walba wuu sameeyaa.
I know it is very good.	Waan ogahay inay aad u fiican tahay.
He could not say.	Wuu sheegi waayay.
To find out more.	Si aad wax badan uga ogaato.
She is like me.	Waxay la mid tahay aniga oo kale.
Not a bit like that.	Ma aha xoogaa sidaas oo kale ah.
But now we are.	Laakiin hadda waxaan nahay.
Very well.	Si aad u wanaagsan.
It was to be known.	Waxay ahayd in la ogaado.
I need to go	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
I don’t like to be surprised.	Ma jecli inaan la yaabay.
I have never done this.	Weligay tan ma samayn.
He is smart.	Isaga oo caqli leh.
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
No old friends.	Ma jiro saaxiibo hore.
I bought this, this, and this.	Waxaan iibsaday kan, kan, iyo kan.
In fact, that was not difficult.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi ma ahayn mid adag.
This is also great.	Tani sidoo kale waa weyn.
Maybe a lot, maybe a long time.	Malaha wax badan, malaha wakhti dheer.
Maybe we can get it all.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan wada heli karno.
That can't be a bad thing.	Taasi ma noqon karto wax xun.
But don't tell them.	Laakiin taas ha u sheegin.
That is true.	Run baa la yidhi.
There is no chance of that here.	Ma jirto fursad taas halkan.
I don't get anything right now.	Waxba hadda maan helin.
No idea if that is true.	Wax fikrad ah maaha haddii taasi run tahay.
He saw.	Wuu arkay.
There is little.	Wax yar ma jiro.
But she could not.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday.
Recently said that the work is too much.	Dhawaan ayaa sheegay in shaqada ay aad u badan tahay.
But he knows he can't.	Laakiin wuu ogyahay inuusan awoodin.
She made time as well.	Waxay samaysay wakhti sidoo kale.
Another time will be announced.	Waqti kale oo waa lagu soo sheegi doonaa.
Don't talk about it again.	Mar dambe ha ka hadlin.
He put it.	Wuxuu dhigay.
I'm sure someone can get it.	Waan hubaa in qof heli karo.
Not just today.	Kaliya maaha maanta.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ma rabo in qofna arko tan.
I really can't take it.	Si dhab ah uma qaadan karo.
Much the same will be required.	Wax badan oo la mid ah ayaa loo baahan doonaa.
And someone else.	Iyo qof kale.
I am what I have.	Aniga waa aniga waxa aan leeyahay.
That is more than any man can do.	Taasi waa wax ka badan mid nin kastaa awoodo.
I do it well	si fiican ayaan u sameeyaa
Who is not included.	Yaa aan ku jirin.
But, well.	Laakiin, si fiican.
I wonder how.	Waxa iga yaab badan sida.
But it can't be helped.	Laakiin lama caawin karo.
And before that, another.	Oo ka hor, mid kale.
not him.	ma isaga.
It looks beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay qurux.
That is what you need.	Taasi waa waxa aad u baahan tahay.
He must.	Waa inuu.
Long one.	Mid dheer.
Definitely something.	Hubaal inay wax ku jiraan.
I can't speak now.	Hadda ma hadli karo.
He was not present.	Ma joogin.
Anywhere, anytime.	Meel kasta, wakhti kasta.
They will not be there.	Halkaas ma joogi doonaan.
No one is there.	Qofna kuma jiro.
But no one wanted to see him.	Laakiin qofna ma doonayn inuu arko.
No one says anything bad.	Cidna wax xun kama sheegto.
I can't believe that now.	Taas hadda ma rumaysan karo.
In fact, it may not be.	Runtii, waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahaan doonin.
He had to do that now.	Waxay ahayd inuu hadda sameeyo taas.
I have done this before.	Tan hore ayaan u sameeyay.
He said it was true.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay run tahay.
He can do the same for you today.	Maanta sidaas oo kale ayuu kuu samayn karaa.
This is what will happen now.	Tani waa waxa hadda dhici doona.
That's it, for sure.	Waa taas, hubaal.
There were three people.	Waxaa jiray saddex qof.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii way qurux badan tahay.
It would take a lot of time.	Waxay qaadan lahayd waqti badan.
I can't speak right now.	Ma hadli karo hadda.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I will take that for granted.	Waan ku qaadan doonaa taas.
I tried and tried.	Waan isku dayay oo isku dayay.
I can't leave him.	Kama tagi karo isaga.
He took it for granted.	Qurux ayuu u qaatay.
She would love to.	Way jeclaan lahayd.
She realized she didn't get it.	Way ogaatay in aanay helin.
They did not stop.	Ma ay joojin.
He didn't want to be.	Ma uusan rabin inuu noqdo.
Always do school work before anything else.	Had iyo jeer shaqada dugsiga ka hor mar wax kasta.
As always.	Sida had iyo jeer.
She has done the same before.	Waxay hore u samaysay wax la mid ah.
To do this.	In aad tan sameyso.
It was the best thing we could do.	Waxay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan ee aan sameyn karno.
But! 	Laakiin!
I didn't like it	Maan jeclayn
I am a friend	waxaan ahay saaxiib
will not help you.	kuma caawin doonaan.
Money, he said.	Lacag ayuu yidhi.
But don't say.	Laakiin ha odhan.
It's just hard for me to say.	Kaliya way igu adag tahay inaan sheego.
He heard something.	Wax buu maqlay.
It's the same with you.	Waa la mid adiga.
The rest is the same.	Inta kale waa isku mid.
You can do what you want.	Waxaad ka samayn kartaa waxa aad rabto.
I don't think they are.	Uma maleynayo inay yihiin.
I am really excited to do it.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan sameeyo.
I can't see you	kuma arki karo
I think we can take it from here.	Waxaan filayaa in aan halkan ka soo qaadan karno.
I will not lie about that.	Taas been ka sheegi maayo.
I need it now.	Waxaan u baahanahay hadda.
Will leave.	Ka bixi doona.
He had to get out of there.	Waxay ahayd inuu halkaas ka baxo.
Very good.	Mid aad u wanaagsan.
Everyone does now.	Qof walba hadda wuu sameeyaa.
Slightly smaller.	Xoogaa ka yar.
It is somewhere else.	Waa meel kale.
This is not going to be pretty.	Tani ma noqon doonto mid qurux badan.
It was busy.	Mashquul bay ahayd.
He was not there to do that.	Ma jirin si uu taas u sameeyo.
You can come back	Dib ayaad u soo noqon kartaa
That's how good he is.	Waa sida uu u wanaagsan yahay.
Now, he was here again.	Hadda, halkan ayuu mar kale ahaa.
I have not been able, so far.	Ma awoodin, ilaa hadda.
She would see what was going on.	Way is arki lahayd waxa jira.
He said she should do what she likes.	Waxa uu yidhi waa in ay samayso waxa ay jeceshahay.
I do not understand	ma fahmin
I did not know you had one.	Maan ogayn inaad leedahay mid.
There may be too many of us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u badan yihiin oo naga mid ah.
In fact, everything is.	Dhab ahaantii, wax walba waa.
You can not win	Ma guulaysan kartid
Not even a little.	Xitaa wax yar ma aha.
She is still happy.	Weli way faraxsan tahay.
You are not there yet	Wali ma aadan joogin
It looks fresh.	Waxay u egtahay mid cusub.
I can only say.	Kaliya waan sheegi karaa.
He loves you so much.	Aad buu kuu jecel yahay.
Very interesting.	Aad u xiiso badan.
I did not know how and why.	Ma aan garanayn sida iyo sababta.
I need more.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan.
You will get a job again.	Waxaad heli doontaa shaqo mar kale.
The past is done.	Wixii hore u dhacay waa la sameeyaa.
We will see that.	Waan arki doonaa taas.
There was no food, either.	Ma jirin cunto, sidoo kale.
I'll tell you later	Dib ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa
What is it today.	Waa maxay maanta.
It is always an appointment at the same time.	Had iyo jeer waa ballan isku mar.
I need to tell him.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan u sheego.
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegin.
No one will speak.	Qofna ma hadli doono.
I just can’t get enough of it.	Kaliya ma heli karo wax igu filan.
What a man.	Waa maxay nin.
I know how to find out.	Waan ogahay sida loo ogaado.
But he knew that was not the case.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inaysan taasi ahayn.
But I still haven't found it	Laakiin weli ma helin
One is instant friends.	Mid waa saaxiibo degdeg ah.
I really think it would be good for me.	Runtii waxaan filayaa inay ii fiicnaan lahayd.
I will never leave here.	Weligay halkan kama tagi doono.
In fact, there are none.	Dhab ahaantii, ma jiraan.
Very fond of.	Aad u jecel.
Obviously, he didn’t.	Sida iska cad, ma uusan samayn sidaas.
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
I had to.	Waxaan ku lahaa.
Everyone said.	Qof kastaa wuu yidhi.
But nothing was done.	Laakiin waxba lama qaban.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
I had a great thing to say.	Waxaan lahaa wax weyn inaan u sheego.
It is expected.	Waa la filayaa.
I did it for you.	Waan ku sameeyay.
It will take time, you know.	Waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti, waad ogtahay.
That is, one has to.	Taasi waa, mid ayaa leh oo.
They will come to you.	Way kuu iman doonaan.
I am very sorry.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay.
The others are nothing now.	Dadka kale hadda waxba kama jiraan.
That sounds great.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u qurux badan.
That is what you will do.	Taas aad samayn doonto.
A very tall man.	Nin aad u dheer.
It's not pretty.	Ma qurux badna.
I own the house.	Aniga ayaa guriga iska leh.
I'm not really sure she can do this.	Runtii ma hubo inay tan samayn karto.
Maybe she was right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax ahayd.
But he never did anything.	Laakiin waligiis waxba ma uu samayn.
I felt it now.	Waxaan dareemay hadda.
And not so correct.	Oo aan sidaas sax ahayn.
I'm sure.	waan hubaa.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
And everyone.	Iyo qof walba.
Uma eka.	Uma eka.
He holds it well.	Si fiican ayuu u hayaa.
I saw myself.	Waan is arkay.
This is something you do not want to do.	Tani waa wax aadan rabin inaad sameyso.
As soon as you did he left.	Isla markii aad samaysay ayuu ka tagay.
No one else, no one else.	Qof kale ma jiro, wax kale ma jiro.
That is the most difficult thing.	Taasi waa waxa aad u adag.
I was really surprised.	Runtii aad baan ula yaabay.
I can't give you anything.	waxba kuma siin karo.
.	.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
You can do anything else with him, but do not love him.	Wax kasta oo kale waad ku samayn kartaa isaga, laakiin ha jeclaan isaga.
None of us.	Mid naga mid ma aha.
It didn’t take long, either.	Waqti dheer kuma qaadan, sidoo kale.
Not that he would ever do it.	Ma aha in uu waligiis yeeli lahaa.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
He's clearly up to something.	Waxa uu si cad ilaa wax.
I want to see you at work.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko shaqada.
Maybe better than that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka wanaagsan taas.
Tell me something new.	Wax cusub ii sheeg.
I can't find it now	Hadda ma heli karo
You are very good.	Aad baad u fiican tahay.
They will not do it.	Ma ay yeeli doonin.
It is early.	Waa hore.
He holds me.	Wuu ii hayaa.
Bad things will happen if you do not stop.	Waxyaabo xun ayaa dhici doona haddii aadan joojin.
That is a very good thing.	Taasi waa wax aad u wanaagsan.
It is nothing new.	Wax cusub maaha.
I definitely enjoyed it	Hubaal waan ka helay
Stop everything you are doing.	Jooji wax kasta oo aad samaynayso.
We are friends, which is nice.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo, taas oo ah wax fiican.
Better yet.	Si ka fiican.
He thought he could help.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inuu caawin karo.
But, you know,.	Laakiin, waad ogtahay,.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican oo wanaagsan.
But you always rejected that.	Laakiin mar walba taas waad diiday.
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxa la sameeyo.
To talk to you.	In aan kula hadlo.
This was mostly true.	Tani waxay ahayd inta badan run.
It could not be.	Ma ay noqon karin.
They looked at each other.	Waa la is eegay.
I really did.	Dhab ahaantii waan ku sameeyay.
I will not leave.	Ka tagi maayo.
One you might like.	Mid laga yaabo inaad jeceshahay.
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
He had to go somewhere.	Waxay ahayd inuu meel aado.
But this can happen.	Laakiin tani way dhici kartaa.
Although it probably is not.	In kasta oo ay u badan tahay in aanay ahayn.
But it was more than that.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax ka badan.
It was beautiful back there.	Waxay ahayd qurux dib halkaas.
Maybe.	Malaha.
There is no place	Meel malaha
He said quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u yidhi.
As you wish.	Sida aad rabto.
That's how it is done.	Taasi waa sida loo sameeyo.
I'm afraid you do not understand.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaadan fahmin.
He's a good guy, he's really good.	Waa nin fiican, runtii waa fiican yahay.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
Another surprise just for me.	Mid kale oo la yaab leh aniga kaliya.
And a lot of fun.	Iyo wax badan oo xiiso leh.
I do not want to be friends with you.	Ma rabo inaan kula saaxiibo.
I heard recently.	Waxaan maqlay dhawaan.
It is so beautiful it cannot be stopped.	Aad ayuu u qurux badan yahay lama joojin karo.
I couldn't stretch.	Waan kala bixi waayay.
It's great, really.	Aad bay u fiican tahay, runtii.
I'm sure every man does.	Waxaan hubaa in nin walba uu sameeyo.
Not to mention.	Ma aha in la sheego.
As you can see, everyone has something!	Sida aad arki karto, qof kastaa wax buu leeyahay!
I have never seen one before.	Weligay mid hore uma arag.
That is so beautiful.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan.
I don't want to say.	Ma rabo inaan sheego.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
That was not correct.	Taasi sax ma ahayn.
I did	waan sameeyay
It was a very difficult job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo aad u adag.
But there are.	Laakiin way jiraan.
It was not beautiful.	Ma ahayn qurux.
You don't have to, anymore.	Uma baahnid, mar dambe.
I know he needs me.	Waan ogahay inuu ii baahan yahay.
They.	Waxay u.
I don't do it now.	Hadda ma sameeyo.
I am, you know.	Anigu waan ahay, waad ogtahay.
You will see the former as well, as it were.	Waxaad arki doontaa kii hore sidoo kale, sida ay tahay.
It will be one year.	Waxay noqon doontaa hal sano.
It was just so much more than that.	Kaliya waxay ahayd wax aad uga badan taas.
I had to.	Waxay ahayd inaan.
Now, let me help you.	Hadda, aan ku caawiyo.
He did not.	Ma uu samayn.
I don't know anything better.	Wax ka fiican ma garanayo.
That is a very good thing.	Taasi waa waxa aad u fiican.
She did not want to.	Ma ay rabin.
And fast.	Iyo mid degdeg ah.
Very happy.	Aad ugu faraxsan.
No one has anything.	Qofna waxba ma haysto.
To help.	Si loo caawiyo.
I did not like it	Maan jeclayn
At school.	Dugsiga.
It will be great to see you.	Aad bay u fiicnaan doontaa inaan ku arko.
But it is a great place.	Laakiin waa meel weyn.
I can get out of very small things.	Waxaan ka bixi karaa waxyaabo aad u yar.
I am still very busy	Wali aad ayaan mashquul u ahay
You can not get anything bigger than this.	Ma heli kartid wax ka weyn tan.
I bought it back	dib ayaan u iibsaday
I think he is there.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu halkaas joogo.
you are not here	halkan ma aadan joogin
We are really just friends.	Runtii waxaan nahay saaxiibo kaliya.
This is going to be great.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
I just don’t know what to do first.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo marka hore.
Stop, he said.	Jooji, ayuu yidhi.
I'm not sure it's right.	Ma hubo inay sax tahay.
I can do it	Waan qaban karaa
Just tell me what's in it for you.	Kaliya ii sheeg waxa adiga kugu jira.
No problem yet.	Dhib weli ma jirin.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
Obviously, it can't happen.	Sida cad, ma dhici karto.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan in la sameeyo.
I would love to help	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo
It is what you do.	Waa waxa aad samayso.
Somewhat.	Xoogaa.
This is something new for me.	Tani waa wax igu cusub.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
It may take until tomorrow.	Waxay qaadan kartaa ilaa berri.
Close friend, it's old.	Saaxiib dhow, waa hore.
I can do the same.	Waxaan samayn karaa wax la mid ah.
I can leave now	Hadda waan bixi karaa
I want to work on something.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka shaqeeyo.
I think that's me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aniga tahay.
That cannot be allowed.	Taas lama ogolaan karo.
They are real things.	Waa waxyaabo dhab ah.
It was tomorrow.	Berri bay ahayd.
Come on in.	Soo galay.
I found you	waan ku helay
Tonight is good.	Caawa wuu fiican yahay.
It is too long.	Aad bay u dheer tahay.
It's hard to see.	Way adag tahay in la arko.
He did not want to be part of it.	Ma uusan rabin inuu ka mid noqdo.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
Also, he probably was right.	Sidoo kale, waxay u badan tahay inuu sax ahaa.
He did not know that.	Taas ma uu ogayn.
I haven’t done that, well, ever.	Taas maan samayn, si fiican, weligay.
They are really good.	Runtii way fiican yihiin.
Each one.	Mid kasta.
Maybe everyone.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in dadka oo dhan.
He knows what he can do.	Waxa uu samayn karo wuu garanayaa.
I went into the house.	Waxaan galay guriga.
It looks obvious.	Waxay u egtahay mid cad.
A lot has happened.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa dhacay.
But this requires something.	Laakiin tani waxay u baahan tahay wax.
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
I'm glad they're all really happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay wada faraxsan yihiin runtii.
He did better than anyone else.	Waxa uu sameeyay si ka wanaagsan qof kasta oo kale.
There is no better time than now.	Ma jiro wakhti ka fiican hadda.
A few years.	Dhowr sano.
He lives near me.	Wuxuu ku nool yahay meel ii dhow.
I was three.	Saddex baan ahaa.
And he really did.	Oo runtii wuu sameeyay.
Tough, but loving.	Adag, laakiin jecel.
It was now.	Waxay ahayd hadda.
I know we are friends.	Waan ogahay inaan nahay saaxiibo.
But when he started, he became a man again.	Laakiin markii uu bilaabay, wuxuu noqday nin mar kale ah.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa.
I'm afraid to leave.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan baxo.
I didn't need much more.	Wax kale oo badan uma baahnayn.
But really, it's not a bad thing.	Laakiin run ahaantii, wax xun maaha.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
Only now.	Kaliya hadda.
I thought he was long gone.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu waa hore tagay.
Free for you.	Lacag la'aan adiga.
I told him so.	Waxaan u sheegay sidaas.
I love you and all.	Waan ku jeclahay adiga iyo dhammaan.
I haven't seen you in a long time, friend!	Waqti dheer ma arag, saaxiib!
In fact most of it is.	Runtii inta badan waa.
I was rejected.	Waa la i diiday.
You will see again.	Waxaad arki doontaa mar kale.
But very beautiful.	Laakiin aad u qurux badan.
She didn't want to know.	Ma ay rabin inay ogaato.
I have no idea how good this is.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto sida tani u fiican tahay.
I need this.	Waxaan u baahanahay tan.
I was very impressed.	Aad ayaan ula dhacay.
I'm sure that will be fine.	Waan hubaa inay taasi fiicnaan doonto.
And, obviously, he knew me.	Oo, si cad, wuu i ogaa.
They are probably lying.	Waxay u badan tahay inay been yihiin.
She told him the truth.	Run bay u sheegtay.
Every time.	Mar walba.
Like today.	Maanta oo kale.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Waan ka shakisanahay, laakiin malaha.
I need to talk to you.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo.
It is abandoned.	Waa laga tagay.
It can happen to him greatly.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa isaga si weyn.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
I'm sure you can	Waan hubaa inaad samayn karto
We did not need it.	Uma baahnayn.
He was not present	Ma joogin
It will be good for everyone.	Way u fiicnaan doontaa qof walba.
It really isn’t something I have.	Runtii maaha wax aan leeyahay.
I think I need more of that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan u baahanahay wax badan oo taas ah.
Something else happened here.	Wax kale ayaa ka dhacay halkan.
Isn't that the same thing.	Miyaanay ahayn wax la mid ah.
Don't tell me.	Ha i sheegin.
They live for us.	Way nagu nool yihiin.
It was constant.	Waxay ahayd mid joogto ah.
That would do it for me.	Taasi waxay ii samayn lahayd aniga.
A long time ago.	Waqti dheer ka hor.
Not an idea.	Maaha fikrad.
I really knew that.	Runtii taas waan ogaa.
Maybe find another !.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in la helo mid kale!.
There is little to do.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo la sameeyo.
Are you ready for this.	Diyaar ma u tahay tan.
It was definitely beautiful.	Hubaal waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
Tell them something.	Wax u sheeg.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
It can do a lot of beautiful things.	Waxay sameyn kartaa wax badan oo qurux badan.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Qof kastaa ma samayn karo waxaad samayso.
We will leave him.	Waanu ka tagi doonaa isaga.
I really want to buy everything.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba iibsado.
It was not true of him.	Run uma ahayn isaga.
It's gone, really.	Waa la waayay, runtii.
I was found.	waa la i helay.
Really well done.	Runtii si fiican loo sameeyay.
He would tell me a little.	Wax yar buu ii sheegi lahaa.
I will come tonight.	caawa ayaan iman doonaa.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Runtii ma jirin wax guriga lagu sameeyo.
They just make money with something new.	Waxa kaliya oo ay lacag ku sameeyaan wax cusub.
He saw what was done to him.	Wuxuu arkay waxa loo sameeyay.
Anyway.	Si walba.
There is not much you can do.	Wax badan oo aad sameyn karto ma jiraan.
But you will.	Laakiin waad yeeli doontaa.
Probably nothing big.	Malaha wax aad u weyn ma jiraan.
I got it here	Halkan ayaan ku helay
Do not take it back.	Dib ha u qaadan.
First the prison.	Marka hore xabsiga.
Tell people what's going on.	U sheeg dadka waxa socda.
She did not want to help.	Ma ay doonayn inay caawiso.
That's fine.	Taas oo iska fiican.
Maybe he is better than anyone.	Malaha wuu ka fiican yahay qof kasta.
You can't tell anyone.	Qofna uma sheegi kartid.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
No problem	Dhib malaha
You need to tell me what is going on here.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ii sheegto waxa halkan ka socda.
I just started	Hadda ayaan bilaabay
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
I didn't even know you were here.	Xitaa maan ogeyn inaad halkan joogto.
Does he owe you any money?	Wax lacag ah miyuu kugu leeyahay?
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah ma leh.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid fiican.
They said nothing to me.	Waxba igama ay odhan.
It really doesn't seem like much.	Runtii uma eka mid aad u badan.
If he had.	Haddii uu lahaa.
You just don't have to	Kaliya uma baahnid
Not only this.	Ma aha oo kaliya arrintan.
It's a real problem.	Waa dhibaato dhab ah.
This was correct.	Tani waxay ahayd sax.
Maybe there is something, but she did not see it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay wax jiraan, laakiin ma ay arag.
That is why he is still here.	Taasi waa sababta uu weli halkan u joogo.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
I am nothing	waxba ma ihi
You think you can do something !.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad wax samayn karto!.
It was a busy day.	Waxay ahayd maalin mashquul ah.
I got a good job.	Waxaan helay shaqo fiican.
I want everyone to have something for tomorrow.	Waxaan rabaa in qof walba uu wax u haysto berrito.
It can't happen to you	Adiga ma dhici karto
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux.
She still does.	Weli way samaysay.
You should too.	Waa inaad sidoo kale.
That sounds good.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
I really can't find enough for me.	Runtii ma heli karo wax igu filan.
Not that he will need it.	Ma aha inuu u baahan doono.
I can't believe he's gone.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu baxay.
For a while now.	In muddo ah hadda.
He saw everything.	Wax walba wuu arkay.
Maybe it was already.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hore u ahayd.
He was not like him.	Ma ahayn isaga oo kale.
Don't leave me.	Ha iga tagin.
I didn't want to see him again.	Ma aanan rabin inaan mar kale arko.
It was home.	Waxay ahayd guriga.
Nothing, nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan, waxba ma jiraan.
Can't help.	Lama caawin karo.
You will need to know how to get there.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad ogaato sida loo tago halkaas.
But that was difficult.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
But it is still interesting.	Laakiin weli waa mid xiiso leh.
I was so surprised.	Waan yaabay sidaas.
I really don't know why.	Runtii ma garanayo sababta.
You just did it.	Kaliya waad samaysay.
No one knew that.	Qofna taas ma ogayn.
Someone who loves	Qof jecel
I am very sorry.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay.
Don't go there.	Halkaas ha tagin.
That is a good and clear thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican oo cad.
And a little.	Iyo mid yar.
I wanted him to come back, but he did not come back.	Waxaan rabay inuu soo noqdo, laakiin ma uu soo noqon.
Here it is.	Halkan waa.
He is a good friend.	Waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
No one really said it.	Ma jiro qof run ahaantii sheegay.
It doesn't matter if it turns out to be.	Wax weyn maaha haddii uu soo baxo.
An unprecedented place.	Meel aan hore loo arag.
I will not say here.	Halkan kuma odhan doono.
In fact, much can be said.	Dhab ahaantii, wax badan ayaa la odhan karaa.
Not so bad.	Ma aha sidaas u xun.
This is a big deal.	Tani waa wax weyn oo weyn.
There was no food in the house.	Guriga ma jirin wax cunto ah.
Everything is set.	Wax walba waa la dhigay.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa inuu halkaas joogi doono.
I withdrew.	Waan ka noqday.
Something bad.	Wax xun.
He has to leave and he has to leave now.	Waa inuu baxo oo waa inuu hadda baxo.
But if.	Laakiin haddii.
And she did not come.	Oo ma ay iman.
I made it so.	Waxaan ka dhigay inay sidaas tahay.
Just hold on.	Kaliya qabo.
I would never do that at home.	Weligay taas guriga kuma aan samayn lahayn.
She would leave.	Way bixi lahayd.
I did the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan sameeyay.
I'll just tell him.	Kaliya waan u sheegi doonaa isaga.
No one would be.	Qofna wuu noqon lahaa.
She refused to say why.	Way diiday inay sheegto sababta.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Ima ay arag.	Ima ay arag.
No wonder.	La yaab maayo.
He has someone else.	Waxa uu leeyahay qof kale.
Busy.	Mashquul.
I love it, and I love it more and more.	Waan jeclahay, oo waan sii jeclahay.
I hope you will.	Waxaan filayaa inaad yeeli doonto.
Maybe he should go.	Malaha waa inuu tago.
Can you tell us about the past?	Ma noo sheegi kartaa wixii hore?
Afterwards, he promised.	Ka dib, wuu ballan qaaday.
If anyone can help me.	Haddii qofna i caawin karo.
That is why he wants to come here.	Taasi waa sababta uu rabo inuu halkan yimaado.
I really enjoyed it.   	Aad ayaan uga helay.   
I would too	sidoo kale waan ahaan lahaa
I wish I could do this every day.	Waan jeclaan lahaa haddii aad tan samayn karto maalin kasta.
I'm not even sure if she likes him.	Xitaa ma hubo inay jeceshahay isaga.
I knew you were doing one.	Waan ogaa inaad mid samaynayso.
Wherever you are, whatever you do, good day.	Meel kasta oo aad joogto, wax kasta oo aad sameyso, maalin wanaagsan.
Hard on him.	Ku adag isaga.
Still, that's what it is.	Weli, waa waxa ay tahay.
We are so.	Waxaan nahay sidaas.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
I am here	waan joogaa halkan
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
But it cannot be done.	Laakiin lama samayn karo.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
I never did that.	Weligay taas ma samayn.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
Obviously, it is not.	Sida iska cad, ma aha.
Me and me and me and me.	Aniga iyo aniga iyo aniga iyo aniga.
I will not talk about it again.	Hadda ka dib kama hadli doono.
I could not find one	Mid baan heli waayay
But maybe it's something else.	Laakiin malaha waa wax kale.
He wondered if she was lucky.	Haddii ay nasiib tahay ayuu is waydiiyay.
Everyone was smart.	Qof kasta oo caqli leh ayaa lahaa.
That is really good.	Taasi runtii way fiican tahay.
But now, nothing.	Laakiin hadda, waxba ma jiraan.
No one really wants that.	Qofna runtii taas ma rabo.
But one day, something will happen again.	Laakiin maalin, wax ayaa mar kale heli doona.
If that is what you want.	Haddii taasi ay tahay waxa aad rabto.
Maybe they still do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli sameeyaan.
Only really hard.	Kaliya runtii adag.
See you tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ku arki doonaa.
Very little.	Aad u yar.
You can tell me.	Waad ii sheegi kartaa.
She did everything she could to help.	Waxay samaysay wax kasta oo ay ku caawin karto.
It is real now.	Waa dhab hadda.
That’s why they don’t like you, you know.	Taasi waa sababta aysan ku jeclayn, waad ogtahay.
I wanted to do it again.	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale sameeyo.
Give us a good chance.	Fursad wanaagsan na sii.
No one would say anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan lahaa.
he is tall.	wuu dheer yahay.
It was true, too.	Run bay ahayd, sidoo kale.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
But no one knows how much.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo inta ay tahay.
It is a huge problem.	Waa dhibaato aad u weyn.
It was small and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid yar oo qurux badan.
What a horrible thing!	Waa maxay wax aad u xun!
I looked away	Waan iska eegay
It will not be now.	Hadda ma ahaan doonto.
He told me to tell the truth.	Waxa uu igu yidhi run sheeg.
I really can’t stay with him and I can’t do much.	Runtii isaga lama joogi karo oo wax badan ma qaban karo.
Also unknown.	Sidoo kale aan la garanayn.
I was unable to find out what was in it.	Waan awoodi waayay inaan ogaado waxa ku jira.
That is not true today.	Maanta taasi run maaha.
And it could be.	Iyo inay noqon karto.
And there is more.	Oo waxaa jira wax ka badan.
Please tell me about this.	Fadlan ii sheeg arrintan.
It seems out of place here.	Waxay u egtahay mid aan meesha ku jirin halkan.
I could not do anything.	Waxba kuma samayn karin.
It was amazing today as it was every day.	Waxay ahayd yaab maanta sida ay maalin walba ahayd.
He said something beautiful.	Wax qurux badan ayuu is yidhi.
This here, and here and there.	Tani halkan, iyo halkaas iyo halkaas.
We do not have to do that.	Ma aha inaan sidaas samayno.
One year ago.	Hal sano ka hor.
I didn’t pay for this.	Ma aanan bixin tan.
This is	Tani waa
Not what he was after.	Ma aha waxa uu ahaa ka dib.
I have never been here.	Weligay halkan ma aan iman.
He doesn't seem to be feeling it.	Uma eka in uu dareemayo.
But it will not.	Laakiin ma yeeli doono.
I can't see anything but money.	Wax aan lacag ahayn ma arki karo.
There is so much he does not talk about.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo uusan ka hadlin.
I don't make a lot of money.	Lacag badan ma sameeyo.
He must have.	Waa in uu leeyahay.
They will probably go.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tagi doonaan.
we will see.	waan arki doonaa.
I have never been one to do that.	Weligay ma noqon mid taas sameeyo.
I need to be here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaan joogo
Someone else came in.	Qof kale ayaa soo galay.
I will never do that again.	Weligay taas mar dambe ma samayn doono.
But not often.	Laakiin maaha inta badan.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
But it will definitely not do anything else.	Laakiin hubaal wax kale ma yeeli doono.
This is not great, but it is better.	Tani maaha mid aad u fiican, laakiin way ka fiican tahay.
He took it seriously.	Isaga ayaa si dhab ah u qaatay.
I would say something.	Wax baan ku odhan lahaa.
Nice to see you.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay inaan ku arko.
You really were.	Runtii waad ahayd.
It will not be right.	Sax ma ahaan doonto.
Everyone owns it.	Qof walba ayaa iska leh.
You can also do this.	Waxaad sidoo kale samayn kartaa tan.
He did not want to be there.	Ma uusan rabin inuu halkaas joogo.
You told me you did.	Waxaad ii sheegtay inaad samaysay.
But there is no real way to do that.	Laakiin ma jirto si dhab ah taas loo sameeyo.
That is what we need.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
Today, not tomorrow.	Maanta, berri maaha.
They probably love each other, too.	Waxay u badan tahay inay is jecel yihiin, sidoo kale.
Now it is you.	Hadda waa adiga.
Which I did not do.	Taas oo aanan samayn.
I will leave early.	Goor hore ayaan bixi doonaa.
I did not say.	Ma odhan.
Something needs to be done.	Wax loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
Obviously this is much longer.	Sida iska cad tani waa wax ka sii dheer.
It was bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun.
I’ve seen a lot, really.	Wax badan ayaan arkay, runtii.
That would do well.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd si fiican.
Tell him to do it.	U sheeg inuu sameeyo.
This was a lie.	Tani waxay ahayd been.
I looked back	Dib baan u eegay
That is what you have to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
She said to me once.	Waxay igu tidhi hal mar.
This will be interesting.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
You just said that.	Kaliya sidaas ayaad sheegtay.
He will surely come.	Hubaal wuu iman doonaa.
It is not.	Ma ahan.
Not much.	Ma badna.
But I don't have much time for that.	Laakiin waqti badan uma hayo taas.
You can take whatever you want.	Mid kasta oo aad rabto waad qaadan kartaa.
We were not even.	Waxaan ahayn xitaa.
In fact, he never saw it.	Dhab ahaantii, waligiis ma arag.
It's bigger, you know.	Way ka weyn tahay, waad ogtahay.
I really do not know what else to say.	Runtii ma garanayo wax kale oo aan sheego.
They did not understand me at all.	Waxba ima ay fahmin.
It doesn't look right	Wax sax ah uma eka
It was more, more.	Waxay ahayd wax badan, ka badan.
More than once, even.	In ka badan hal mar, xitaa.
I know people who need this.	Waan garanayaa dadka u baahan tan.
Everyone was.	Qof kastaa wuxuu ahaa.
But only here.	Laakiin halkan kaliya.
He heard and saw enough.	Wax ku filan ayuu maqlay oo arkay.
He did it often.	Inta badan wuu sameeyay.
From now on.	Hadda ka dib.
I think it is bigger now than ever.	Waxaan filayaa inay hadda ka weyn tahay sidii hore.
That does not exist now.	Taasi hadda ma jirto.
I was lucky to get the job.	Nasiib baan u helay shaqada.
I'm sure you will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa inaad si fiican u fiicnaan doonto.
He learns nothing.	Waxba ma barto.
I did not think of anything other than what it was.	Uma malaynayn wax kale oo aan ahayn waxa ay ahayd.
Much better.	In badan oo ka wanaagsan.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
They had to do this.	Waxay ahayd inay tan sameeyaan.
I can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karo.
This is a big problem.	Tani waa dhibaato weyn.
He needs work.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay shaqada.
Not now, not now.	Hadda ma jiro, hadda ma jiraan.
I had no idea how he did it.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin sida uu u sameeyay.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda way fiican tahay.
I think he will love you when he gets to know you.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku jeclaan doono marka uu ku barto.
It was a great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
A bit, too.	Xoogaa, sidoo kale.
He was also a tough guy.	Waxa kale oo uu ahaa nin dhib badan.
It can be fun.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid xiiso leh.
I think we can do that.	Waxaan filayaa inaan taas samayn karno.
I could not find it.	Waan heli waayay.
She told him not to do it again.	Waxay u sheegtay in aanu dib u samayn.
You have three.	Waxaad leedahay saddex.
It doesn't look like it was before.	Uma eka mid waa hore ka hor.
This was now.	Tani waxay ahayd hadda.
Not so today.	Maanta sidaas maaha.
There was not much to talk about.	Ma jirin wax badan oo laga hadlo.
But not only that.	Laakiin ma aha oo kaliya.
He did not want her to do this.	Ma uu doonayn in ay tan samayso.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
You have to be smart.	Waa in aad caqli badan tahay.
It looks like he wants to be invisible.	Waxay u egtahay inuu doonayo inuu noqdo mid aan la arki karin.
It is best not to tell him, either.	Waxaa ugu wanaagsan in uusan u sheegin, mid ka mid ah.
First there were people.	Marka hore waxaa jiray dadka.
And affordable as well.	Iyo mid la awoodi karo sidoo kale.
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
I spent a year there.	Hal sano ayaan halkaas ku qaatay.
I hope it helps too !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidoo kale ku caawin doonto!.
I can believe that.	Waan rumaysan karaa taas.
I came back to you.	waan kuu soo noqday.
This is unexpected.	Tani waa waxa aan filan lahayn.
You do not need that.	Uma baahnid taas.
But it is definitely correct.	Laakiin waxaa hubaal ah in ay tahay mid sax ah.
Well, don't tell them.	Fiican, ha u sheegin.
It's the same with people.	Waa la mid dadka.
It can only be given.	Waxaa la siin karaa oo kaliya.
I will never believe that.	Weligay taas ma rumaysan doono.
Exactly the same.	Dhab ahaan sidaas oo kale.
It's fast	Waa degdeg
I did not know what had happened.	Ma garanayn waxa dhacay.
This is what you like.	Tani waa waxa aad jeceshahay.
This is the worst.	Tani waa tan ugu xun.
I can't be there.	Meesha kuma joogi karo.
It was not a very good place.	Ma ahayn meel aad u fiican.
He is an amazing person.	Waa qof la yaab leh.
I never went, not even once.	Weligay ma aanan tagin, xitaa hal mar.
Maybe expect it.	Malaha filan lahayd.
Any of them.	Wax kasta oo ka mid ah.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha.
I'm not sure about that.	Ma hubo arrintan.
Not once but three times.	Hal mar maaha ee waa saddex jeer.
I hope they will.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sameyn doonaan.
It’s all you can do.	Waa wax kasta oo aad ku samayn karto.
There is nothing we can do now.	Wax aan hadda qaban karno ma jiraan.
I didn't have time for this.	Waqti uma helin tan.
I came out.	Waan ka soo baxay.
There is nothing you cannot have.	Wax aadan haysan karin ma jiraan.
There was no one to stop you and help you.	Ma jirin qof ku joojin lahaa oo ku caawin lahaa.
Qof.	Qof .
It was by far the best.	Waxay ahayd ilaa hadda tan ugu fiican.
I have to stay	Waa in aan sii joogo
No cars are visible.	Ma jiro baabuur la arki karo.
Now, let me also state this clearly.	Hadda, aan sidoo kale si cad u sheego arrintan.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
He should not be surprised.	Ma ahayn inuu la yaabo.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
Whatever this was.	Wax kasta oo tani ahayd.
There was not much else to say.	Ma jirin wax kale oo badan oo la sheego.
As much as you like.	Inta aad jeceshahay.
Everyone seemed good to me.	Qof walba wuxuu ii muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I knew there was another.	Waan ogaa inuu mid kale jiro.
She did not want him to leave.	Ma ay rabin inuu tago.
One is the new one.	Mid waa kan cusub.
What a good time.	Maxaa waqti fiican.
You can see it today.	Waad arki kartaa maanta.
If you really want to, you will.	Haddii aad runtii rabto, waad sameyn doontaa.
And so on.	Oo sidaas.
That is required.	Taas ayaa loo baahan yahay.
Only very small.	Kaliya mid aad u yar.
Probably he was everyone.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu ahaa qof walba.
He lied.	Been buu sameeyay.
You will find more about this.	Wax badan ayaad ka heli doontaa tan.
It can't be better.	Ma ay fiicnaan karto.
But I can't find it	Laakiin ma heli karo
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
Something happened.	Wax baa dhacay.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
A little harder.	In yar oo adag.
She told me something was in it.	Wax bay ii sheegtay inay ku jirto.
They both love it here.	Labaduba way jecel yihiin halkan.
It is similar to the other.	Waxay la mid tahay tan kale.
What's interesting.	Maxaa xiiso leh.
You must have done this before.	Waa inaad tan hore u samaysay.
I am very busy today.	Maanta aad ayaan mashquul u ahay.
It should not take too long.	Waa inaysan qaadan waqti aad u dheer.
Something is going on here.	Wax baa halkan ka socda.
He thinks you are alone.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inaad keligaa tahay.
But nothing like it was found.	Laakiin wax la mid ah lama helin.
To find out who I am now.	Si aan u ogaado qofka aan ahay hadda.
It would come out right.	Waxay u soo bixi lahayd si sax ah.
I had nothing to do with him.	Wax shaqo ah kuma aan lahayn isaga.
tell me how you are	ii sheeg sida aad tahay
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay tan.
You have to promise me!	Waa in aad ii ballan qaado!
That is not what she does.	Taasi maaha waxa ay samayso.
You can not leave.	Kama bixi kartid.
What can be done?	Maxaa la qaban karaa?
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Very good indeed.	Aad u fiican runtii.
Maybe you can help us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad naga caawin karto.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax fiican.
That was the only reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta kaliya.
This cannot happen	Tani ma dhici karto
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
If it were, everyone would do it.	Haddii ay ahaan lahayd, qof kastaa wuu samayn lahaa.
Great and great.	Mid weyn oo weyn.
But if someone takes a new idea, it's good.	Laakiin haddii qof uu ka qaado fikrad cusub, waa fiican tahay.
Much, much less.	In badan, aad uga yar.
That was tomorrow.	Taasi waxay ahayd berri.
I would like to know if this was so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado inay sidaas ahayd iyo in kale.
As long as you are.	Inta aad tahay.
It's an exciting time.	Waa wakhti xiiso badan.
And a lot of work.	Iyo shaqo badan.
Correct.	Sax sax ah.
This is something everyone loves.	Tani waa mid qof walba jecel yahay.
And you can get it.	Oo waad heli kartaa.
You will get what you need.	Waxaad heli doontaa waxaad u baahan tahay.
I think this is a big deal.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in tani ay tahay wax weyn.
That, but not everything.	Taas, laakiin maaha wax kasta.
I asked him what he wanted.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu rabo.
I'm sure it's the latter.	Waan hubaa inay tahay tan dambe.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
It's always amazing.	Waa yaab mar walba.
I will tell you again.	Mar kale ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa.
He is ready to go.	Wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu tago.
I would really like to see that.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko.
There is nothing too difficult.	Ma jiraan wax aad u adag.
And there is nothing more certain.	Oo ma jiraan wax ka badan oo la hubo.
Going home, that is.	Inaad guriga aado, taasi waa.
I would pay	waan bixin lahaa
Everyone knows everything.	Qof walba waa ogyahay wax walba.
I just had to know where to find it.	Kaliya waxay ahayd inaan ogaado meesha laga helo.
We are set.	Waa nala dhigay.
What happened will happen again.	Wixii dhacay mar kale ayaa dhici doona.
He had to come up with something better.	Waxay ahayd inuu la yimaado wax ka wanaagsan.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
That is just me.	Taasi waa aniga kaliya.
Maybe you will.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad noqon doonto.
Really, it’s a little weird.	Runtii, waa wax yar oo la yaab leh.
We would not do it.	Ma yeeli lahayn.
He wondered why he didn't say anything.	Muxuu wax u odhan waayay buu is waydiiyay.
I just looked.	Kaliya waan eegay.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Wuu ogaa wax kasta oo uu u baahan yahay inuu ogaado.
You can not believe anyone.	Qofna ma rumaysan kartid.
He is a person.	Waa qof.
It looks great.	Aad ayuu u muuqdaa.
Everyone wants to do better.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu sameeyo wax ka wanaagsan.
I think there are good things.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jiraan waxyaabo wanaagsan.
He was a very tough guy.	Nin aad u adag buu ahaa.
Now I know it very well.	Hadda si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
He will not allow her to do this.	Uma ogolaan doono inuu tan sameeyo.
You did everything.	Wax walba waad samaysay.
I like what you do	Waxaan ka helay waxaad sameyso
I have no money.	Lacag ma haysto.
I just can't believe it.	Kaliya ma rumaysan karo.
But not just any man.	Laakiin ma aha oo kaliya nin kasta.
I know he knows.	Waan ogahay inuu garanayo.
I can't take this anymore!	Ma qaadan karo tan mar dambe!
This is constant	Tani waa joogto
He got a chance.	Fursad ayuu helay.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I do not know how to say that clearly.	Ma garanayo si aan si cad ugu sheego taas.
Now he is well off.	Hadda si fiican ayuu uga baxay.
I guess you can't do that.	Waxaan filayaa inaadan taas samayn karin.
Don’t think that a little bit.	Ha u malayn taas in yar.
He was no longer the same person.	Mar dambe isku qof ma ahayn.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan hadda tago.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
I will do it again	mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa
Even if that.	Xitaa haddii taasi.
Maybe even before.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xitaa ka hor.
That is indeed true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
I need to get out of here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkan ka baxo
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
Not available now.	Hadda lama heli karo.
I will be more than ready.	Waxaan noqon doonaa in ka badan diyaar.
To speak so.	In uu sidaas ula hadlo.
Obviously this will not be a working day.	Sida iska cad tani ma noqon doonto maalin shaqo.
I know there is a lot going on.	Waan ogahay inay jiraan waxyaabo badan oo socda.
There was no time to eat.	Ma jirin wakhti wax la cuno.
More than that.	In ka badan inta.
I didn’t, at first.	Maan qaban, marka hore.
But first.	Laakiin marka hore.
I love me.	Aan jeclahay aniga.
I wanted to have it.	Waxaan rabay inaan haysto.
You also can't do anything.	Sidoo kale waxba ma samayn kartid.
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
I would take him to prison.	Waxaan qaadan lahaa xabsiga.
It is a very difficult luck for him.	Waa nasiib aad u adag isaga.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
They are too big.	Aad bay u weyn yihiin.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
It just was a bad time for me.	Kaliya in ay waqti xun ii ahayd.
He wanted to do more.	Waxa uu rabay in uu wax ka badan sameeyo.
But there is no way it can be true.	Laakiin ma jirto si ay run u noqon karto.
Among them	Ka mid ah
I had to go to the back door.	Waxay ahayd inaan tago albaabka dambe.
Less than three years.	In ka yar saddex sano.
You can come here.	Waxaad iman kartaa halkan.
I’m happy for him, really.	Waan ku faraxsanahay isaga, runtii.
I was just here	halkaan kaliya ayaan joogay
And John was astonished.	Yooxanaa wuu yaabay.
But no one said anything.	Laakiin cidna waxba uma uu odhan.
He did not know that she would do that.	Ma uu ogayn inay taas samayn doonto.
I need to know how he did it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida uu u sameeyay.
I will give it to you.	waan ku siin.
And one and the other told the truth.	Oo mid iyo mid kale ayaa run sheegay.
It would be awful.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid aad u xun.
Something bad will happen.	Wax xun ayaa dhici doona.
This cannot happen otherwise.	Si kale uma dhici karto tani .
You can do more than that.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka badan taas.
I wish I had	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto
I have no help.	Wax caawin ah uma hayo.
He would be a friend for a long time to come.	Wuxuu noqon lahaa saaxiib muddo dheer soo socda.
He still lives there.	Weli wuu ku nool yahay halkaas.
And now it was your turn.	Oo hadda waxay ahayd markii aad.
Maybe he would talk to her.	Malaha wuu la hadli lahaa.
This can take a very long time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa waqti aad u dheer.
I do not understand how.	Ma fahmin sida.
Maybe I didn't like it.	Malaha ma jeclayn.
Wax.	Wax.
This was very close.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
Still, he stayed.	Weli, wuu sii joogay.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida uu yahay.
He thought he did.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in uu sameeyay.
I'm sure very little.	Waxaan hubaa wax aad u yar.
It's so beautiful, isn't it?	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay, saw maaha?
you are a little man.	nin yar baad tahay .
And now it was known what it was.	Oo hadda waa la ogaa waxay ahayd.
And who might that be, you say.	Oo yaa laga yaabaa in taasi tahay, waxaad leedahay.
He no longer knew.	Mar dambe ma uu ogayn.
It will happen, it will happen, it will happen.	Way dhici doontaa, way dhici doontaa, way dhici doontaa.
She must have said a little to him.	Waa in ay wax yar ku tidhi isaga.
I have to go	waa inaan aado
That was a lot.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax badan.
I did not know.	Maan ogayn.
I couldn't tell him.	Waa u sheegi waayay.
They are both beautiful and complete.	Labaduba way qurux badan yihiin oo way wada dhan yihiin.
And what someone needs.	Iyo waxa uu qof u baahan yahay.
Well done.	Si wanaagsan.
he can do it.	wuu samayn karaa.
Everything was here and there.	Wax kasta oo halkan ahaa oo jira.
Only room.	Kaliya qolka.
Something interesting, really.	Wax xiiso leh, runtii.
But not for a while.	Laakiin ma aha in muddo ah.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
This is a big problem.	Tani waa dhibaato weyn.
You can get it.	Waad heli kartaa.
Just too much work.	Kaliya shaqo aad u badan.
It will be very good.	Aad bay u fiicnaan doontaa.
Another great thing to do.	Wax kale oo weyn oo la sameeyo.
Now your home.	Hadda guriga aad.
Three years ago.	Saddex sano ka hor.
Much the same.	Wax badan ayaa la mid ah.
I don't get this.	Anigu ma helo tan.
It’s everyone.	Waa qof walba.
I don't feel anything for him.	Anigu waxba isaga uma dareemayo.
It is better to have it.	Waxaa ka wanaagsan in la haysto.
I have nothing.	Waxba igama jiraan.
I think she likes you a little.	Waxaan filayaa inay ku jeceshahay in yar.
Everyone around here knows.	Qof kasta oo halkan ku dhow wuu garanayaa.
Maybe I left someone.	Malaha qof baan ka tagay.
But that should not be the case.	Laakiin taasi waa inaysan noqon.
You can actually do anything.	Waxaad dhab ahaantii samayn kartaa wax kasta.
Whatever they are.	Wax kasta oo ay yihiin.
That is the other way around.	Taasi waa tan kale.
It's a little weird.	Waa yara yaab.
I would do no less.	Wax ka yar ma samayn lahaa.
Maybe he did.	Malaha wuu sameeyay.
But that does not exist now.	Laakiin taasi hadda ma jirto.
I do not know who they are.	Ma garanayo cidda ay yihiin.
That is exactly what it looks like.	Dhab ahaantii taasi waa sida ay u egtahay.
And it was not.	Oo ma ahayn.
There was nothing.	Waxba kuma jirin.
I am with you.	taas waan kula joogaa.
Not too bad.	Aad uma badna si xun.
Today it is even better.	Maanta way ka sii wanaagsan tahay.
Very difficult.	Aad u adag.
I do not get it.	ma helo.
It contains.	Waxa ay ku jirto.
I will say it again, only.	Mar kale ayaan odhan doonaa, kaliya.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I really do not know what to do.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
There was something terrible that they did not know.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u xun oo aysan ogeyn.
For me, that is.	Aniga ahaan, taasi waa.
I have a clear job.	Waxaan hayaa shaqo cad cad.
I will not be harmed until later.	La iga yeeli maayo ilaa goor dambe.
It is enough for me.	Way igu filan tahay aniga.
He really does.	Runtii wuu sameeyaa.
He really liked it.	Aad ayuu uga helay.
He may have refused.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu diiday.
I am one.	Waxaan ahay mid.
I can't stay for a while	Wax yar ma joogi karo
Something happened.	Wax baa dhacay.
A little weird, really.	Wax yar oo yaab leh, runtii.
Not so now.	Hadda sidaas maaha.
He wanted to do it.	Wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo.
As he did.	Sida uu sameeyay.
This is a great opportunity.	Tani waa fursad aad u fiican.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Lama sheegin meesha ay tani ka soo bixi doonto.
That probably.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay.
I do not talk about this.	Kama hadlo arrintan.
He knew, it wasn't me.	Wuu ogaa, aniga ma ahayn.
Maybe so and so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas tahay iyo malaha.
Surprising, but true.	La yaab leh, laakiin run ah.
But this will take time.	Laakiin tani waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
You are a little friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib yar.
It is needed.	Waa loo baahan yahay.
Why.	Maxay tahay sababta.
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
Which we do not.	Taas oo aanu samayn.
I was a smart guy.	Waxaan ahaa nin caqli badan.
I used to say that.	Waxaan u sheegi jiray sidaas.
Just work.	Kaliya shaqada.
So far they have not.	Ilaa hadda ma aysan haysan.
I thought it could be.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu noqon karo.
It’s really something in the making.	Runtii waa wax ku jira samaynta.
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
I do not understand	ma fahmin
He thought it was big but a little surprised.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in ay weyn tahay laakiin xoogaa yaabay.
But he wanted to know more.	Laakiin wuxuu rabay inuu wax badan ogaado.
I picked it up.	Waan soo qaaday.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
He looked beautiful.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid qurux badan.
I got it right.	Si fiican ayaan u helay.
Very beautiful and not too busy.	Aad u qurux badan oo aan mashquul ahayn.
That is always the case.	Taasi mar walba waa sida ay tahay.
I am so glad I found you.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku helay.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
That is, you did.	Taasi waa, waad samaysay.
I started like a few years ago.	Waxaan bilaabay sidii dhowr sano ka hor.
She knew nothing.	Waxba kama ay ogayn.
That is to be expected.	Taasi waa la filayaa.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
It is really a lie.	Runtii waa been.
He looked at the rest.	Inta kale ayuu eegay.
You can't see the house, you say.	Guriga ma arki kartid, waxaad leedahay.
But this is not the case here.	Laakiin halkan sidaas maaha.
Not that he thought it would happen.	Ma aha in uu u maleeyay in ay dhici doonto.
If they do, great.	Haddii ay sameeyaan, weyn.
I was everywhere.	Meel walba waan joogay.
Now you can do something about it, just like me.	Hadda waxaad wax ka qaban kartaa, si la mid ah aniga oo kale.
I'm happy to be here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo
And there is something else.	Oo wax kale ayaa jira.
Somewhere, some time there.	Meel, waqti ka mid ah halkaas.
It also has a fast and tough speed.	Waxa kale oo uu leeyahay degdeg degdeg ah oo adag.
No one else is here.	Qof kale halkan ma joogo.
I have to stay	Waa inaan joogo
But that was a lie.	Laakiin taasi been bay ahayd.
It is new and unprecedented.	Waa cusub oo aan hore loo sheegin.
I knew it was true.	Waxaan ogaa inay run tahay.
It really happened to me.	Runtii wuu igu dhacay.
I can't lie.	Been uma sheegi karo.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu wax walba ka yaqaan qof walba.
This, of course, was true.	Tani, runtii, waxay ahayd run.
Someone hit us.	Qof baa nagu dhacay.
I need to see you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko
They will not allow another.	Ma u ogolaan doonaan mid kale.
He did not want to be known.	Ma uusan rabin in la ogaado.
That has a lot.	Taasi waxay leedahay wax badan.
It has to be done for me	Waa in la i sameeyaa
But we are just friends.	Laakiin waxaan nahay saaxiibo kaliya.
You are better off doing it often.	Waad ku fiican tahay inta badan inaad sidaas samayso.
I wanted to do it seriously.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo si dhab ah.
They are very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
If you have any idea.	Haddii aad wax fikrad ah lahayd.
He was in a bad mood.	Niyad xun buu ku jiray.
This is not the same thing.	Tani ma aha wax la mid ah.
I just started	Hadda ayaan bilaabay
I will do my best.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa sida ugu fiican.
She said no one was home.	Waxay tidhi qofna guriga ma joogo.
This is an old problem.	Tani waa dhibaato hore.
He became part of it.	Waxa uu ka mid noqday.
Everyone would like to do more.	Qof kastaa wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo wax badan.
It just needs to be self-explanatory.	Waxay u baahan tahay oo kaliya in la is sheego.
Not small.	Ma yara.
Please let me know	Fadlan ii soo sheeg
Just like anywhere else, once you go, you would go.	Si la mid ah meel kasta oo kale, mar aad tagi lahayd, waad tagi lahayd.
He did not succeed.	Ma uu guulaysan.
Something terrible happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
Now, you are ready	Hadda, diyaar baad tahay
It should be well known.	Waa in si fiican loo yaqaan.
He felt ready for anything.	Wuxuu dareemay inuu diyaar u yahay wax kasta.
Much to be learned from there.	Wax badan oo laga soo qaadan karo halkaas.
That's right, another one.	Waa sax, mid kale.
Often it is not interesting.	Inta badan ma aha wax xiiso leh.
I would be fine now	Hadda waan fiicnaan lahaa
I will stay there	Waan joogi doonaa halkaas
They were not there.	Ma ay joogin halkaas.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
Everything else did.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
They could no longer see.	Mar dambe ma ay arki karin.
I really didn't need to.	Runtii uma baahnayn.
Has anything similar been said ?.	Ma wax la mid ah ma la sheegay?.
It will be here.	Waxay ahaan doontaa halkan.
She did.	Way samaysay.
I think about that.	Waan ka qabaa taas.
I will be ready for him.	Isaga ayaan diyaar u ahaan doonaa.
Not much.	Ma aha in badan.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
If you could help that would be great.	Haddii aad caawin karto taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
And this would be true.	Oo tani run bay ahaan lahayd.
It is very, very difficult.	Aad iyo aad bay u adag tahay.
Let it come out, let it come out!	Ha soo baxo, ha soo baxo!
Maybe he didn't come.	Malaha ma iman.
That's not fun.	Taasi xiiso badan maaha.
I had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo.
You have done very well.	Wax aad u wanaagsan ayaad samaysay.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
He said it was too much.	Wuxuu sheegay inay aad u badan tahay.
Another time.	Waqti kale.
But it is good for me.	Laakiin way ii fiican tahay aniga.
It was a little big job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo yar oo weyn.
I could not do anything.	Waxba maan qaban karin.
He did not see.	Ma uusan arag.
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
There is always something she can do.	Had iyo jeer waxa jira wax ay samayn karto.
He had a lot of work to do.	Waxa uu lahaa shaqo aad u badan.
He did not come close.	Uma soo dhawaan.
Big and solid.	Weyn oo adag.
Hold it well.	Si fiican u qabo.
But he knew that.	Laakiin taas wuu ogaa.
Nin aan.	Nin aan.
Let him tell another.	Mid kale ha u sheego.
Do not tell them anything.	Waxba ha u sheegin.
That's when it was.	Waa markii ay ahayd.
For the most part, that is.	Inta badan, taasi waa.
Too much going on, too much to do.	Aad u badan ayaa socda, aad u badan in la sameeyo.
Not everyone comes out at once.	Qof walba isku mar ma soo baxo.
I came out	waan soo baxay
It is enough for me.	Way igu filan tahay aniga.
That doesn't look right.	Taasi si sax ah uma eka.
That is it.	Taasi waa taas.
Still, she did not give up.	Weli, ma aysan siin.
In fact, several good ones did.	Dhab ahaantii, dhowr wanaagsan ayaa sameeyay.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
He can do better	Si ka wanaagsan ayuu samayn karaa
You have to do a lot of work to do this.	Waa inaad samaysay shaqo badan si aad tan u samayso.
It is work time	Waa wakhti shaqo
As there is not even.	Sida xitaa ma jirto.
He doesn't seem to be feeling it.	Uma eka in uu dareemayo.
Just see yourself	Kaliya is arag
It is not money.	Maaha lacag.
I don't want a tan.	Maan rabin tan.
One day, he will come out.	Maalin, wuu soo bixi doonaa.
He should have known.	Waa inuu ogaa.
This was close to what he needed.	Tani waxay ahayd mid u dhow waxa uu u baahan yahay.
I felt the same way.	Waxaan dareemay sidii oo kale.
Not every idea is good.	Fikrad kasta ma aha mid wanaagsan.
It's just not right.	Kaliya sax maaha.
Apparently, he did not.	Sida cad, ma uusan lahayn.
Not him.	Ma aha isaga.
I never knew what.	Weligay maan garanayn waxa.
I tried, but this is really the best.	Waan isku dayay, laakiin tani runtii waa tan ugu fiican.
She is beautiful.	Qurux bay leedahay.
How to get this.	Sidee lagu heli karaa tan.
I love how it went.	Waan jeclahay sida uu u baxay.
He said it was good.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay fiican tahay.
As he said.	Inta uu yiri.
He said he did not even know why.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu xitaa garanayn sababta.
There is something else, too.	Wax kale ayaa jira, sidoo kale.
That’s fine, but not great.	Taasi waa fiican, laakiin ma weyn.
I would have been here before	Hore ayaan halkan u joogi lahaa
There is nothing fast enough.	Ma jiraan wax degdeg ah oo ku filan.
I can no longer take this.	Mar dambe ma qaadan karo tan.
None of us.	Ma mid naga mid ah.
I think it's you.	Waxay ila tahay inay adiga tahay.
It was very good.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I saw someone.	Waxaan arkay qof.
I never got it.	Weligay ma helin.
I will go there	halkaas ayaan tagi doonaa
That’s why you can’t get much out of it.	Taasi waa sababta aadan wax badan ka heli karin.
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
He's tough, he's smart.	Wuu adag yahay, waa caqli badan yahay.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan leeyahay wax badan oo aan sheego.
I was one of them.	Waxaan ka mid ahaa.
He did not get it.	Ma uu helin.
He knows how to communicate.	Wuxuu yaqaan sida loo wada hadlo.
And they do.	Oo ay sidaas sameeyaan.
But something else.	Laakiin wax kale.
We were not.	Waxaan ahayn .
You may know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ogaato.
I had nothing else.	Wax kale maan haysan.
He came to me.	Wuu ii yimid.
I want to see you	waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko
I want to go	Waxaan rabaa inaan tago
If so, he obviously does not know it well.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, waxa iska cad in aanu si fiican u garanayn.
That is the only time.	Taasi waa marka kaliya.
He did not want to tell anyone.	Ma uu doonayn in uu cidna u sheego.
What it was, is still.	Maxay ahayd, weli waa.
I was asked.	Waxa la iga codsaday.
Not like me.	Aniga oo kale maaha.
But that is.	Laakiin taasi waa.
But it will be seen.	Laakiin waa la arki doonaa.
I don’t get him.	Anigu ma helo isaga.
It may not be necessary to do so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan loo baahnayn in sidaas la sameeyo.
I wanted to say more.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan sheego.
To be taken.	In la qaado.
He has done it before.	Hore ayuu u sameeyay.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan.
He knows what really happened.	Wuu garanayaa waxa runtii dhacay.
It’s work, it’s work.	Waa shaqo, waa shaqo.
Not sure how to do that.	Ma hubo sida loo sameeyo taas.
I do not see it available.	Ma arko in la heli karo.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
He never came.	Waligiis ma iman.
Today, everyone does everything.	Maanta, qof kastaa wax walba wuu sameeyaa.
This is widely known.	Tani waa mid si weyn loo yaqaan.
You know you like it.	Waad ogtahay inaad jeceshahay.
I can help you	Waan ku caawin karaa
I am better.	Aniga ayaa iga fiican.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
It is not a place.	Meel maaha.
They will see who you are.	Waxay ku arki doonaan waxaad tahay.
He looked in a good place.	Meel fiican ayuu ka eegay.
You know what would happen.	Waad ogtahay waxa dhici lahaa.
needed to know.	loo baahan yahay in la ogaado.
It would be nice if she could do that, but not only that.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii ay sidaas samayn lahayd, laakiin kaliya maaha.
He could not say what it was.	Wuxuu sheegi waayay waxay ahayd.
But he wanted more.	Laakiin wax ka badan ayuu rabay.
We can't find it.	Ma heli karno.
She really loves him.	Runtii way jeceshahay isaga.
Nothing happened.	Wax dhacay ma jirin.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
Let it come.	Ha yimaado.
He would have a day.	Maalin buu heli lahaa.
I did not say it again, again, after he told me that.	Mar dambe ma odhan, mar dambe, ka dib markii uu ii sheegay in.
Everything is nothing.	Wax walba waa waxba.
I really like it.	Runtii waan jeclahay.
It's just too much to keep.	Waxa kaliya oo aad u badan in la haysto.
I want you to do this today.	Waxaan rabaa inaad tan sameyso maanta.
He saw her at the front door.	Wuxuu ku arkay albaabka hore.
I have no chance.	Fursad ma haysto.
He did not understand.	Ma uu fahmin.
I wanted to tell you something similar.	Waxa aan rabay in aan kaa sheego wax la mid ah.
All you need.	Dhammaan waxaad u baahan tahay.
He said to me.	Aniga ayuu yidhi.
It will only happen more.	Waxa kaliya oo dhici doona in ka badan.
They didn't get much.	Wax badan kuma ay helin.
Let it come to you.	Ha kuu yimaado.
Now I looked.	Hadda waan eegay.
That will take time.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
I want to talk about something else.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax kale ka hadlo.
It was a great place to work.	Waxay ahayd meel fiican oo laga shaqeeyo.
I haven't had it in a while.	In muddo ah ma helin.
There must be someone else.	Waa inuu jiraa qof kale.
But this is new.	Laakiin tani waa cusub.
Now you need it, and you need it urgently.	Hadda waxaad u baahan tahay, oo si degdeg ah ayaad ugu baahan tahay.
A few years later it will be me.	Dhowr sano ka dib ayaa aniga ahaan doona.
But that is not what it says.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ay leedahay.
That is also not true.	Taasi sidoo kale run maaha.
Something better may be at work.	Wax ka wanaagsan ayaa laga yaabaa inay shaqada ku jiraan.
I can do better than you.	Waan samayn karaa si ka fiican adiga.
That was the same as given to us.	Taasi waxay la mid ahayd nala siiyay.
I did not do so.	Ma samayn sidaas oo kale.
You can find it here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
A clear day.	Maalin cad.
That is the best.	Taasi waa waxa ugu fiican.
Just there.	Kaliya halkaas.
No one really wants to do that.	Qofna runtii ma rabo inuu taas sameeyo.
I didn't get any money, I had nowhere to go.	Lacag ma helin, meel aan aado ma jirto.
That's enough now.	Waa ku filan hadda.
I took it again.	Mar kale ayaan isla qaatay.
She did.	Way samaysay.
You must eat food first.	Waa inaad marka hore cunto cunto.
It is needed.	Waa loo baahan yahay.
I have things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan sameeyo.
Someone has to.	Qof waa inuu.
I didn't even know you had a car.	Xitaa maan ogeyn inaad baabuur leedahay.
There is so much new.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo cusub.
He had nothing to say.	Wax uu ka sheego ma jirin.
It is as it is now.	Waa sida ay hadda tahay.
There were three problems.	Waxaa jiray saddex dhibaato.
You need more	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax badan
He really didn't want to be here.	Runtii ma uusan rabin inuu halkaan joogo.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
Now I am back.	Hadda waan soo noqday.
It really is.	Waa runtii.
He always paid.	Mar walba wuu bixin jiray.
And love and all.	Oo jecel iyo dhammaan.
This is not true now	Tani hadda run maaha
He refused.	Waa diiday.
It does not look like anyone.	Qofna uma eka.
Enough.	Oo ku filan.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
But you can see.	Laakiin waad arki kartaa.
Probably the latter.	Malaha kan dambe.
', it was'.	', waxay ahayd'.
When they do, it's great.	Marka ay sameeyaan, waa wax weyn.
It would be the same idea.	Waxay noqon lahayd fikrad isku mid ah.
Just a few.	Kaliya dhowr.
We are great friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo weyn.
As of now, here with you.	Sida hadda, halkan kula.
Urgent?	Degdeg ah?
Just happy, happy, happy.	Kaliya faraxsan, faraxsan, faraxsan.
Lie to yourself.	Been u sheeg.
There is nothing he can do now.	Wax uu hadda qaban karo ma jiro.
I don't know what would happen.	Ma garanayo waxa dhici lahaa.
I really enjoyed it!	Aad ayaan uga helay!
In fact, it is also unemployment.	Dhab ahaantii, sidoo kale waa shaqo la'aan.
I had little food.	Waxaan lahaa cunto yar.
But there is a new one.	Laakiin waxaa jira mid cusub.
I went and did so.	waan tagay oo sidaas sameeyay.
She told me she couldn’t stay longer.	Waxay ii sheegtay in aanay joogi karin wakhti dheer.
It can't do it any other way.	Si kale ma ay yeeli karto.
Mostly right.	Inta badan waa sax.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, laga yaabaa, laga yaabaa.
I was always in trouble.	Mar walba dhibaato ayaan ku jiray.
I tried it first.	Waxaan isku dayay markii hore.
I really hope she does.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inay sameyso.
I do not know why he refused.	Ma garanayo sababta uu u diiday.
This is true for everyone.	Tani waa run qof walba.
This is how it is.	Tani waa sida ay tahay.
It will be better soon.	Hadda mar dhow way fiicnaan doontaa.
It’s like you’re the only thing that exists.	Waxay la mid tahay inaad tahay waxa kaliya ee jira.
This should come as no surprise.	Tani waa in aan la yaab lahayn.
I hope you find it so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas oo kale u heli doonto.
It really looks amazing.	Runtii waxay u egtahay wax yaab leh.
The people there are very friendly.	Dadka halkaas ku nool aad bay u saaxiib yihiin.
But, that's what it is.	Laakiin, waa waxa ay tahay.
I want to see you every day.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko maalin kasta.
She is definitely happy.	Hubaal waa faraxsan tahay.
No one should have that available.	Qofna ma aha in taas la heli karo.
There is nothing better to do.	Ma jiro wax ka fiican in la sameeyo.
This is how you should do it.	Tani waa sida ay tahay inaad sameyso.
There are many things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan.
There are some interesting things.	Waxyaabo xiiso leh ayaa jira.
Every day there were new things to see.	Maalin kasta waxaa jiray waxyaabo cusub oo la arko.
I am ready to be friends.	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan saaxiibo noqdo.
I thought you were someone else.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay qof kale.
That is an idea.	Taasi waa fikrad.
As soon as he can, he will pay.	Isla markii uu awoodo, wuu bixin doonaa.
Not for everyone.	Ma aha qof walba.
It can take a whole day.	Waxay qaadan kartaa maalin dhan.
There was nothing new here, again.	Ma jirin wax cusub halkan, mar kale.
You are very lucky.	Aad baad u nasiib badan tahay.
He used to tell her.	Wuu u sheegi jiray.
I don't know if it was already done or not.	Ma garanayo in hore loo sameeyay iyo in kale.
It’s everything and more.	Waa wax walba iyo in ka badan.
You can't be me.	Aniga ma noqon kartid.
Wax.	Wax.
But much more than you might expect.	Laakiin wax badan oo ka badan inta aad filan karto.
I am just	waxaan ahay kaliya
It was too long.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer.
But I can't see you today.	Laakiin maanta kuma arki karo.
She said something.	Wax bay ku tidhi.
He is back now.	Hadda ayuu soo noqday.
I do that	taas ayaan sameeyaa
I did not have the time I needed.	Ma aan haysan waqti aan u baahanahay.
I am the only one who got something.	Anigu waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee wax helay.
But that wasn’t too bad.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
I just have to do it.	Kaliya waa inaan sameeyo.
There is really nothing to say.	Runtii ma jiraan wax loo sheego.
You were not present.	Ma aadan joogin.
He was not there to stay here.	Ma jirin si uu halkan u joogo.
I really know that.	Runtii taas waan ogahay.
I want to do this right.	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan si sax ah u sameeyo.
He was not a friend.	Ma ahayn saaxiib.
There was something else, too.	Wax kale ayaa jiray, sidoo kale.
It doesn't look good.	Si fiican uma eka.
He tried, he really did.	Wuu isku dayay, runtii wuu sameeyay.
It's small, but maybe you can see it.	Way yar tahay, laakiin malaha waad arki kartaa.
But making it was awful.	Laakiin samaynta waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
I guess you're not there.	Waxaan filayaa inaadan joogin.
It was a lie.	Been bay ahayd.
It will not be a problem.	Dhib ma noqon doonto.
I don't want anything from others.	Wax ka ma rabo dadka kale.
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha mid dhib badan.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
I have never seen this before.	Weligay tan hore uma arag.
I need to be there	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas joogo
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
A big problem.	Dhib weyn.
Enough has already happened.	Ku filan ayaa hore u dhacay.
I would love to see more of this !.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko wax badan oo tan ah!.
It just was true.	Kaliya waxay ahayd run.
Everyone, really.	Qof kasta, runtii.
He did not want to talk to me.	Ma uu rabin inuu ila hadlo.
But nothing could be seen.	Laakiin ma jirin wax la arki karo.
I don't know what else to tell you.	Wax kale oo aan kuu sheego ma garanayo.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
In fact, it could not be otherwise.	Runtii, si kale ma noqon karto.
He was right.	Mid sax ah ayuu ahaa.
It can be very positive.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
One chance, that was.	Hal fursad, taasi waxay ahayd.
It can't be anything.	Waxba ma noqon karto.
Still, he wanted more.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, wax badan ayuu rabay.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay .
He will do it.	Wuu yeeli doonaa.
There may be a chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto fursad.
That was not him.	Taasi ma ahayn isaga.
It belongs to me.	Aniga ayaa iska leh.
I think this will be really interesting.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay runtii noqon doonto mid xiiso leh.
Everything is there.	Wax walba ayaa jira.
I have nothing better.	Ma haysto wax ka fiican.
It was even harder.	Waxay ahayd wax ka sii adag.
But very little.	Laakiin aad u yar.
Everything you can do will be done well.	Wax kasta oo aad samayn karto si fiican ayaa loo samayn doonaa.
No one can help me with this.	Qofna ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
Not now, yet.	Hadda ma aha, weli.
Several times since.	Dhowr jeer tan iyo.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa mid wanaagsan.
But this is too much.	Laakiin tani waa wax aad u badan.
He looked beautiful.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid qurux badan.
I wanted to know how you are today.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sida aad maanta tahay.
I heard that.	Waxaan maqlay taas.
And it happened a long time ago.	Oo dhacay wakhti dheer ka hor.
Back.	Dib u noqday.
It was good.	Waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
No one understood what was going on.	Qofna ma fahmin waxa socda.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
He is not at home.	Ma joogo guriga.
If you do not want to, do not do it.	Haddii aadan rabin, ha sameyn.
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
It certainly could have been better.	Waxa hubaal ah in ay ka sii fiicnaan karto.
But so it was.	Laakiin sidaas ayaa loo helay.
He knew nothing else.	Wax kale ma uu ogayn.
That is what I did.	Taasi waa waxa aan sameeyay.
I am serious.	dhab baan ahay.
What happened is this.	Maxaa dhacay waa kan.
I have to work late tonight.	Waa inaan shaqeeyo goor dambe oo caawa ah.
There was a lot.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
But she was also someone else.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay ahayd qof kale.
It just needs time.	Kaliya wuxuu u baahan yahay waqti.
Not much now.	Ma aha wax badan hadda.
That was for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd hubaal.
It looks like me.	Waxay u egtahay aniga.
For a while.	Muddo wakhti ah.
I can go where you are not.	Waan tagi karaa meesha aadan joogin.
Really not sure.	Runtii ma hubo.
I have no idea what they do, really.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxay sameeyaan, run ahaantii.
That is awful!	Taasi waa wax aad u xun!
Not anymore.	Mar dambe ma aha.
That's why he wants it.	Taasi waa sababta uu isaga doonayo.
No, that is a blatant lie.	Ma aha, taasi waa been cad.
What is it?.	waa maxay?.
Don't misunderstand me.	Ha i fahmin.
To say she loves me.	Si aan u sheego inay i jeceshahay.
In fact, we will often pay a little better to do it.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaan inta badan bixin doonaa xoogaa wanaagsan si aan u samayno.
I have no money.	Lacag ma haysto.
Otherwise, not too much.	Haddii kale, ma aad u badan.
You do not have to do everything.	Ma aha inaad wax walba samayso.
I can't get to be.	Ma heli karo inaan noqdo.
Everything is very good.	Wax walba aad bay u wanaagsan yihiin.
Now he was not just a man.	Hadda ma ahayn nin kaliya.
He will stay here	Wuu joogi doonaa halkan
But that is great if.	Laakiin taasi waa weyn haddii.
It is the least we can do.	Waa waxa ugu yar ee aan sameyn karno.
It will be more than you know !.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax ka badan inta aad ogtahay!.
Let's do the same here, he said.	Aan ku samayno wax la mid ah halkan, ayuu yidhi.
But there are.	Laakiin way jiraan.
No one had it.	Qofna ma haysan.
Don't have other things to do?	Miyaadan haysan waxyaabo kale oo aad sameyso?
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
This is a great place like any other.	Tani waa meel u fiican sida mid kasta.
There is nothing too exciting here.	Ma jiraan wax aad u xiiso badan halkan.
Good job.	Shaqo wanaagsan.
He said bad things would happen otherwise.	Wuxuu sheegay in waxyaabo xun ay dhici doonaan haddii kale.
I don’t think anyone really does.	Uma maleynayo in qofna runtii sameeyo.
That is a very good thing.	Taasi waa wax aad u fiican.
It is now done.	Hadda waa la sameeyay.
They love me.	Way i jecel yihiin.
This is a big, big thing.	Tani waa wax weyn, aad u weyn.
Not many, but few.	Ma badna, laakiin dhowr.
Ideally.	Fikrad ahaan.
I will do that	Waan samayn doonaa taas
Very, very, very long.	Aad, aad, aad u dheer.
Maybe you will be fine.	Malaha waad fiicnaan doontaa.
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
He also told us that it was really unbelievable.	Waxa kale oo uu noo sheegay in ay runtii tahay wax aan la rumaysan karin.
Now it contains	Hadda waxa ku jira
They are very small.	Aad bay u yar yihiin.
This will be a great day.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa maalin weyn.
What is near.	Waa maxay dhow.
It can be a long day, he said.	Waxay noqon kartaa maalin dheer, ayuu yidhi.
That should be sufficient enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I will be.	waan ahaan doonaa.
Whatever they do, they do it together.	Wax kasta oo ay sameeyaan, way wada sameeyaan.
I should have known you couldn’t get out of it.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaadan ka soo bixi karin.
He looks happy.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan.
Maybe you like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad jeceshahay.
That is a lesson to be learned.	Taasi waa wax laga barto.
You can make very good money.	Waxaad samayn kartaa lacag aad u fiican.
He decided to eat a meal.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu cuno cunto.
Everyone wants some money!	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa xoogaa lacag ah!
Quickly	Si degdeg ah
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
It may not be over.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan dhammaan.
All you want.	Dhammaan waxaad rabto.
Really long time.	Runtii waqti dheer.
There is nothing worse than not knowing what you will get.	Ma jiro wax ka xun inaadan garanayn waxaad heli doonto.
But that is not yet what you want.	Laakiin taasi weli ma aha waxa aad rabto.
Certainly not one of us.	Hubaal mid naga mid ah maaha.
Very long.	Aad uga dheer.
And really, she did.	Oo runtii, way samaysay.
Everyone looked.	Qof kastaa wuu eegay.
It was very real.	Aad bay dhab u ahayd.
It doesn't end there.	Wax kale kuma eka.
He wanted to go out and do something.	Wuxuu rabay inuu baxo oo uu wax sameeyo.
He said.	Wuxuu yidhi.
It can even get better.	Xitaa wuu fiicnaan karaa.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
Like several of them.	Sida dhowr ka mid ah.
And really, they are great.	Oo runtii, way weyn yihiin.
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
I'll just get out of there.	Kaliya waan ka soo bixi doonaa halkaas.
I used to be like that.	Waxaan ahaan jiray sidaas oo kale.
She should have known everything.	Waxay ahayd inay wax walba ogaato.
He says he does not, but he does.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu samayn, laakiin wuu sameeyaa.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
Just the whole place.	Kaliya meesha oo dhan.
He has something.	Wax buu leeyahay.
It had to come out a bit.	Waxay ahayd inuu xoogaa soo baxo.
Everything had to be done correctly.	Wax walba waxay ahayd in si sax ah loo sameeyo.
Take a chance.	Fursad qaado.
Something similar.	Wax kale oo la mid ah.
She said she could not believe it.	Waxay tidhi ma rumaysan karto.
You can take any amount you want.	Waxaad qaadan kartaa lacag kasta oo aad rabto.
That was a bad idea.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
No one knew exactly what he was going to do.	Qofna si sax ah uma ogayn waxa uu samayn doono.
But it was consistently rejected.	Laakiin si joogto ah ayaa loo diiday.
We are all happy.	Waan wada faraxsanahay.
I should have seen it.	Waxay ahayd inaan arko.
I should never have gone there.	Ma ahayn inaan weligay halkaas tagin.
I had a long time.	Waxaan lahaa waqti dheer.
I did not know his whereabouts.	Meesha uu joogo ma garanayn.
I am not so great.	Ma ihi sidaas u weyn.
I will not lie about that.	Ka been sheegi maayo taas.
I felt for him.	Waxaan dareemay isaga.
All she has to do is stay.	Waxa kaliya ee ay tahay inay sameyso waa inay iska joogto.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
I will leave a lot to be desired.	Wax badan ayaan ka bixi doonaa.
I want to be with you for a while.	Waxaan rabaa in aan kula joogo xoogaa waqti ah.
It is beautiful and.	Waa qurux iyo.
I couldn’t even get that.	Xitaa taas ma heli karin.
I did not want to do anything.	Maan jeclayn inaan waxba sameeyo.
It is what you want to do.	Waa waxa aad rabto inaad sameyso.
I can't do it tonight.	Ma samayn karo caawa.
And how happy she is to be with me.	Iyo sida ay ugu faraxsan tahay inay ila joogto.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
He came back.      	Dib buu u soo noqday.      
Now he does.	Hadda wuu sameeyaa.
I do not know this.	Ma garanayo tan.
This is exactly what it is.	Tani waa dhab ahaan waxa uu u yahay.
You will do it first.	Marka hore waad sameyn doontaa.
Unemployment, lack of food.	Shaqo la'aan, cunto la'aan.
And so you are.	Oo sidaas ayaad tahay.
She shouldn’t have done that, either.	Ma ahayn inay taas samayso, sidoo kale.
We are really here.	Waxaan dhab ka nahay halkan.
No one seems to have heard anything.	Qofna uma eka inuu wax maqlay.
It's all very interesting.	Dhammaan waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
I don't like to talk about it.	Ma jecli inaan ka hadlo.
It's hard and it's hard.	Way adag tahay oo waa adag tahay.
Please if you can help me with this.	Fadlan haddii aad iga caawin karto arrintan.
I'm really sure.	Runtii waan hubaa.
That was a lot of money.	Taasi waxay ahayd lacag badan.
Required	Loo baahan yahay
But this was great.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
Whether they like it or not.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin iyo haddii kale.
Not true.	Run maaha.
I must	waa inaan
Now you can do whatever you want.	Hadda waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
But as of now this is not true.	Laakiin sida ay hadda tahay tani run maaha.
What you need is what you need.	Waxa aad u baahan tahay waa waxa aad u baahan tahay.
If you do it right.	Haddii aad si sax ah u sameyso.
As mentioned earlier,	Sida hore loo sheegay,
That's not what.	Taasi maaha waxa.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta ay taasi tahay.
I don't like this one.	Ma jecli kan.
If anyone can, it's you.	Haddii qof uu awoodo, waa adiga.
I really don't care.	Runtii waxba igama qabo.
Something came to work.	Wax ayaa ku yimid shaqada.
He did not want to do anything.	Wax uu ku sameeyo ma uu rabin.
Who knows where.	Meesha yaa yaqaan.
We have to get to know each other.	Waa in la is barto.
It was busy.	Mashquul bay ahayd.
But luckily, you will.	Laakiin nasiib kasta, waad sameyn doontaa.
I had to leave early today.	Waxay ahayd inaan goor hore ka tago maanta.
This she did.	Tani way samaysay.
I don't think that's true.	U malayn maayo in taasi run tahay.
I wanted to talk to you.	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo.
I was one.	Mid baan ahaa.
She desperately needs him.	Aad bay ugu baahan tahay isaga.
I hope you are too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale tahay.
But now he could not.	Laakiin hadda wuu awoodi waayay.
No one will help you.	Qofna kuma caawin doono.
Nothing here is true.	Wax halkan ah ma aha mid run ah.
This is not what we need.	Tani ma aha waxa aan u baahanahay.
It was not an emergency.	Ma ahayn mid degdeg ah.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
They are enough.	Way ku filan yihiin.
We would do everything for you	Wax walba waan kuu qaban lahayn
Not sure what it was.	Ma hubo waxay ahayd.
I really have no idea.	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
He did not want to be anywhere else.	Ma uusan rabin in uu meel kale joogo.
Maybe he felt that way.	Laga yaabaa inuu dareemay sidaas oo kale.
I think it is very difficult.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u adag tahay.
I want you to be here with me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkan ila joogto.
She did it most of the time.	Inta badan way samaysay.
Found today.	Maanta ayaa la helay.
You are not there yet.	Wali ma aadan joogin.
I don't see how that will help.	Ma arko sida ay taasi u caawin doonto.
He became a very loving man.	Wuxuu noqday nin aad u jecel.
This is what you have to do.	Tani waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
They are very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
Not much.	Uma badna.
You really had me.	Runtii waad i lahayd.
Now.	Hadda.
The latter did.	Kii dambe wuu sameeyay.
Money.	Lacag.
I will not see.	Ma arki doono.
I will not stay here.	Ma sii joogi doono halkan.
I need	waxaan u baahanahay
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
But that is another day as well.	Laakiin taasi waa maalin kale sidoo kale.
You told me.	Waad ii sheegtay.
I really want everything from this.	Runtii tan ayaan wax walba ka rabaa.
You know, you are really beautiful.	Waad ogtahay, runtii waad qurux badan tahay.
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
Do not say anything.	Waxba ha odhan.
Who would be for us.	Yaa noo noqon lahaa.
It was again.	Waxay ahayd mar kale.
This is a minor problem.	Tani waa dhibaato yar.
You were busy	mashquul baad ahayd
For the most part, it wasn’t a big deal.	Inta badan, wax weyn ma ahayn.
Still, he seemed happy.	Weli, wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
It’s what he likes.	Waa waxa uu jecel yahay.
But they have not yet found it.	Laakiin weli ma aysan helin.
Still another problem.	Weli dhibaato kale.
I think they are, but maybe not everyone.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay yihiin, laakiin malaha maaha qof walba.
But she was always there.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waxay ahayd halkaas.
What will happen to us?	Maxaa nagu dhici doona?
Don't have anything.	Waxba ha haysan.
Not everyone is like that.	Qof walba sidaas uma aha.
I do not understand this.	Ma fahmin tan.
No one is present.	Qofna ma joogo.
he couldn't take it, really.	wuu qaadan waayay, runtii.
He felt troubled.	Waxa uu dareemay dhib.
For a long time.	Muddo dheer.
He gave everything.	Wax walba wuu siiyay.
No problem now.	Dhib hadda ma jirto.
Whatever it was.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd.
Otherwise, everyone will tell.	Haddii kale, qof kastaa wuu sheegi doonaa.
Something is coming to you soon.	Wax ayaa kugu soo socda goor dhow.
It was a lot of things.	Waxay ahayd waxyaabo badan.
It looks smaller.	Waxay u egtahay mid ka yar.
I will take it.	waan qaadan doonaa.
I was with him.	waan la joogay.
I expect it to really come out soon.	Waxaan filayaa inuu si dhab ah u soo bixi doono dhawaan.
But how can this be a good thing?	Laakiin sidee tani wax wanaagsan u samayn kartaa?
He was a good friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib wanaagsan.
First of all it is a good idea.	Marka hore waa fikrad wanaagsan.
That is what we need to do.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay inaan samayno.
It really is.	Waa runtii.
This is not all.	Tan kaliya maaha.
How he will succeed is yet to be seen.	Sida uu u guulaysan doono weli lama arki doono.
I did things you could not have imagined.	Waxaan sameeyay waxyaabo aadan malayn karin.
He really liked it.	Aad buu uga helay.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Taas wax aad ka qaban kartaa ma jirto.
More, nothing less.	Wax ka badan, wax ka yar ma jiro.
It was not difficult.	Ma ahayn mid adag.
This is the same for people.	Tani waa isku mid dadka.
I tried	waan isku dayay
Tell it is me.	U sheeg waa aniga.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
I entered.	Waan galay.
Just like you friend.	Sida adiga oo kale saaxiib.
There is nothing to do, nothing to do.	Ma jiraan wax la sameeyo, wax la sameeyo ma jiraan.
She will find you.	Way ku heli doontaa.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid .
It could be more.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax ka badan.
Very small and beautiful.	Aad u yar oo qurux badan.
This is a short time before this is done.	Tani waa wax yar ka hor inta aan taas la samayn.
No one is happy.	Qof faraxsan ma jiro.
That is a lot of time.	Taasi waa waqti badan.
I have not come yet.	Wali ma iman.
It may not be new.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn mid cusub.
That’s a lot for me.	Taasi waa aniga wax badan.
I just know, it’s all.	Kaliya waan ogahay, waa dhan.
I will not go out.	Anigu u bixi maayo.
He said quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u yidhi.
I have something to do.	wax aan sameeyo ayaan hayaa.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
You can't do everything.	Wax walba ma samayn kartid.
It is long.	Waa mid dheer.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
No time.	Waqti ma leh.
I know more than you.	Waan ogahay in ka badan adiga.
You are alone.	Keligaa ayaad tahay.
There was very little.	Waxa jiray wax aad u yar.
I need to tell you everything.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax walba kuu sheego.
That if he did that would happen.	In haddii uu sidaas sameeyo ay taasi dhici doonto.
I did not know that.	Maan ogayn taas.
There is not a single car at all.	Ma jiro hal baabuur oo dhan.
I just did not understand what it was.	Kaliya maan fahmin waxa ay tahay.
But every great man did.	Laakiin nin kasta oo weyn ayaa sidaas sameeyay.
I decided.	Waxaan go'aansaday.
I know she does.	Waan ogahay inay sameyso.
Which probably won't do me any good.	Taas oo ay u badan tahay in aanay igu samayn karin.
Who lives here?	Yaa halkan ku nool?
And good if you were good.	Oo fiican haddii aad fiicnaan lahayd.
He wanted to learn about this.	Waxa uu rabay in uu arrintan wax ka barto.
It was like me at school.	Waxa ay ila mid ahayd aniga dugsiga.
More smart.	In ka badan caqli badan.
I like a lot of things	Waxaan jeclahay waxyaabo badan
That is obvious.	Taasi waa wax iska cad.
I wanted to be	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo
He can do anything.	Wax walba wuu samayn karaa.
You were a little helpless.	Waxa aad ahayd wax yar oo aan waxba haysan.
I will not talk to anyone else.	Qof kale kula hadli maayo.
You need to know.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
it was amazing.	yaab bay ahayd.
But you are very good.	Laakiin aad baad u fiican tahay.
Everyone was still at home.	Qof kastaa weli guriga ayuu joogay.
No one was present.	Qofna meesha ma joogin.
But there was more to it than that.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan taas.
I felt that.	Waxaan dareemay taas.
The big one.	Kan weyn.
Maybe a little.	Malaha wax yar.
All very well.	Dhammaan aad u wanaagsan.
They may not say anything.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay waxba odhan.
And you will need it.	Oo waxaad u baahan doontaa.
Most of the time, you can’t get that.	Inta badan, taas ma heli kartid.
But maybe not.	Laakiin malaha maaha.
Today, it's just you.	Maanta, waa adiga kaliya.
so I took it.	sidaas ayaan u qaatay.
I have a better idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad ka fiican.
But that cannot happen.	Laakiin taasi ma dhici karto.
I can get everything	Wax walba waan heli karaa
Be friends too.	Aad saaxiibo sidoo kale.
I have not done that yet.	Taas weli maan samayn.
Still love him.	Weli isaga jecel.
I'm sure she would like it.	Waxaan hubaa inay jeclaan lahayd.
I should have seen it earlier.	Waxay ahayd inaan hore u arko.
Something unknown was felt near.	Wax aan la garanayn ayaa dareemay in u dhow.
I love the people here.	Waxaan jeclahay dadka halkan.
Everyone wants money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa lacag.
It was everywhere in the house.	Waxay ahayd meel kasta oo guriga ah.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
But he is not able to do so.	Laakiin ma awoodo inuu sidaas sameeyo.
I wish you did not do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaadan taas samayn.
I wish I could be more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax badan oo aan noqon karin.
He would see that.	Taas wuu arki lahaa.
I just felt that way.	Kaliya taas ayaan dareemay.
Soon, it will be.	Dhawaan, waxay noqon doontaa.
I would give everything.	Wax walba waan siin lahaa.
More to do.	Wax badan oo la sameeyo.
I found.	waan helay.
He told the truth.	Run buu u sheegay.
But it was great.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
That was what it was.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ay ahayd.
You do not understand, are you?	Ma fahmin, miyaad tahay?
That they do not.	In aanay samayn.
I do not know what.	Ma garanayo waxa.
Nothing bothers me.	Wax dhib igu ah.
Still, maybe that is better.	Weli, malaha sidaas ayaa ka fiican.
Maybe I want one	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mid rabo
He loves you very much.	Aad iyo aad buu kuu jecel yahay.
I will definitely come.	Waa hubaal inaan iman doono.
But this is.	Laakiin tani waa.
We will find a place for you to go.	Waxaan ku heli doonaa meel aad aadi karto.
I think that's very good.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi aad u fiican tahay.
I don't want you to get it.	Ma rabo waad heli kartaa.
Opportunity.	Fursad.
I don't want to	Ma rabo
Not at all.	Maaha.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan hadda tago.
I was part of that.	Waxaan ka mid ahaa taas.
It will not be the same.	Isku mid ma noqon doonto.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii badan.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
He should not be here, he should not even be here.	Waa inuusan halkaan joogin, xitaa waa inuusan halkaan joogin.
You probably can do better.	Waxaad u badan tahay inaad si ka wanaagsan samayn karto.
I have never seen this before.	Tan hore uma arag.
he can take.	wuu qaadan karaa.
I did not know where it could be.	Maan garanayn meel ay noqon karto.
No wonder there.	La yaab malaha halkaas.
He would never do that before.	Waligiis ma uu yeeli doonin taas ka hor.
It was new.	Waxay ahayd mid cusub.
I don't like it here, you know.	Ma jecli halkan, waad ogtahay.
He has a lot ahead of us.	Wax badan ayuu naga hor joogaa.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
It will do nothing.	Waxba ma qaban doonto.
Obviously, he did not know what to do.	Sida iska cad, waxa uu sameeyo ma garanayn.
Whatever you like is what you will do.	Wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay waa waxa aad sameyn doonto.
It is rare here	Waa ku yar yahay halkan
I can really tell you, it is not.	Runtii waan kuu sheegi karaa, sidaas maaha.
He went to work.	Shaqo ayuu u tagay.
There is no such time now.	Ma jiro waqti la mid ah hadda.
But he was not the only one.	Laakiin ma ahayn ka kaliya.
Bigger is better.	Ka weyn ayaa fiican.
But I do.	Laakiin waan sameeyaa.
Beautiful, but solid.	Qurux badan, laakiin adag.
It would be nice if that was the case.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii taasi ay ahaan lahayd.
There is so much you can do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo aad sameyn karto.
Most of the time I still have it.	Inta badan wali waan hayaa.
But it was not found.	Laakiin lama helin.
I haven’t done much of this.	Ma aanan samayn in badan arrintan.
Then we will see where I go from there.	Ka dib waxaan arki doonaa meesha aan ka tago halkaas.
I really like it	Runtii waan jeclahay
I put myself in enough time.	Waxaan iska dhigay waqti ku filan.
I wanted to do it.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo.
Less than more.	In ka yar in ka badan.
I want you to know that for sure.	Waxaan rabaa inaad taas si dhab ah u ogaato.
There was nothing to see.	Ma jirin wax la arko.
That really can't help it.	Taasi runtii lama caawin karo.
It was a lot.	Wax badan bay ahayd.
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
Something went wrong	Wax baa ka soo baxay
And a great opportunity.	Iyo fursad weyn.
In fact, this is not true.	Dhab ahaantii, tani run maaha.
Everyone says so.	Qof kastaa sidaas ayuu yidhi.
You can't talk.	Ma hadli kartid.
You would be right	Sax baad ahaan lahayd
And a good one, too.	Iyo mid wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
I wanted to be a person.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo qof.
All here is clear.	Dhammaan halkan waa cad yihiin.
This was very small.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
Very good, he said.	Aad u fiican, ayuu yidhi.
I can be	Waxaan noqon karaa
There is no problem here.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan halkan.
I do it already.	hore ayaan u sameeyaa.
that's how we live.	sidaas ayaan u nool nahay.
He said they would.	Wuxuu sheegay inay sameyn doonaan.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
Everything is ready.	Wax walba waa diyaar.
I like	waan jeclahay
There are many things we can do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo aan sameyn karno.
He must go now.	Waa inuu hadda tago.
It had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I picked it up somewhere else.	Meel kale ayaan ka soo qaatay.
Now there was something to look forward to.	Hadda waxaa jiray wax la rajaynayo.
Everyone did something wrong.	Qof kastaa wuxuu sameeyay wax xun.
I was not alone.	Kaliya ma aanan ahayn.
Today was great.	Maanta waxay ahayd mid weyn.
Not much.	Ma badna.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
He was as beautiful as ever.	Wuxuu ahaa mid qurux badan sidii hore.
That's how it went.	Sidii baa loo galay.
She did not want to do anything.	Ma rabin inay wax samayso.
She said she could not see what she was doing.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay arki karin waxa ay samaynayso.
Not true, but it was true.	Sax maaha, laakiin run bay ahayd.
She loves everyone.	Waxay la jeceshahay qof walba.
He looked good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid fiican.
What you said may be true.	Waxa aad sheegtay ayaa laga yaabaa inay run tahay.
It cannot be true, it cannot be true.	Run ma noqon karto, run ma noqon karto.
But there is still to go.	Laakiin waxaa jira ilaa hadda in la tago.
I tried to talk to him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la hadlo.
One went out yesterday.	Mid baa shalay baxay.
He looked at me intently.	Aad buu ii eegay.
Just out	Kaliya ka baxay
Obviously this is a very difficult problem.	Sida cad tani waa dhibaato aad u adag.
Please, please, please.	Fadlan, fadlan, fadlan.
I had to work the way it was done.	Waxay ahayd inaan ka shaqeeyo sidii loo sameeyay.
Let me speak openly about this.	Aan si cad uga hadlo arrintan.
You can not help me.	Ima caawin kartid.
She was unable to tell us who he was.	Way awoodi wayday inay noo sheegto qofka uu yahay.
I got nothing.	Waxba waan ku helay.
But she had to be there.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inay halkaas joogto.
That doesn't matter.	Taasi dhib ma leh.
He heard enough.	In ku filan ayuu maqlay.
No one knew anything.	Qofna waxba ma ogayn.
Everything is as it should be.	Wax walba waa sidii la rabay.
The best.	Tan ugu fiican.
There is not enough.	Wax ku filan ma jiro.
What is it	waa maxay
Maybe a little less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax yar ka yar.
But they did not know that.	Laakiin taas ma ay ogayn.
I will be ready	diyaar ayaan noqon doonaa
That is surprising now.	Taasi waa yaab hadda.
I am not, but I am also not a man.	Anigu ma ihi, laakiin sidoo kale nin ma ihi.
Let's do something fun.	Aan samayno wax xiiso leh.
No one can help you.	Qofna kuma caawin karo.
Maybe it is still.	Malaha waa weli.
I am just like everyone else.	Waxaan ahay sida qof kasta oo kale.
It seems to me that there is more than one man in me.	Waxay ila mid tahay inay igu jiraan wax ka badan hal nin.
That's right, you know.	Waa run, waad ogtahay.
I just know it's not.	Kaliya waan ogahay inuusan ahayn.
How to do it.	Sida loo sameeyo.
There is no more day.	Maalin dambe ma jirto.
Unemployment.	Shaqo la'aan.
For a very, very long time.	Muddo aad iyo aad u dheer.
I am always with you.	Mar walba waan kula joogaa.
This did not help.	Tani ma caawin.
Which is not a lie.	Taas oo aan been ahayn.
I thought it was really good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii fiican tahay.
This may be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa run.
I tried to figure out what had happened.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado waxa dhacay.
So far, that is.	Ilaa hadda, taasi waa.
He told us everything.	Wax walba wuu noo sheegay.
No one should have said so.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu sheego.
Who says that?	Yaa sidaas leh?
This was as far as she would go.	Tani waxay ahayd ilaa inta ay tagi doonto.
But, but, but.	Laakiin, laakiin, laakiin.
Still not sure what to do.	Wali ma hubo waxaan sameeyo.
I did nothing.	Waxba kuma aan samayn.
I am very scared	Aad ayaan uga baqayaa
It can stay.	Way joogi kartaa.
It is new and exciting.	Waa cusub oo faraxsan.
Both at the same time.	Labaduba isku mar.
Good day!.	Maalin wanaagsan!.
I could be better	Waan ka fiicnaan karaa
That was not what really happened.	Taasi ma ahayn waxa runtii dhacay.
It will be much, much better.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax badan, aad uga wanaagsan.
I felt left out.	Waxaan dareemay in taas laga tagay.
Maybe it really is.	Malaha runtii waa.
he wanted to know.	wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado.
There are so many of them.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo ka mid ah.
I know where it is.	Waan ogahay meesha ay tahay.
I looked at it once.	Hal mar ayaan eegay.
That is why it is good.	Taasi waa sababta ay u wanaagsan tahay.
They really do.	Runtii way sameeyaan.
Obviously not.	Waxaa cad in aysan ahayn.
It would be like.	Waxay ahaan lahayd sida.
I can tell people to do something.	Waxaan u sheegi karaa dadka inay wax sameeyaan.
Maybe it was too early.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd waqti hore.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
Do not talk too much.	Aad ha u hadlin.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
Everything is set.	Wax walba waa la dhigay.
And money they make.	Iyo lacag ay sameeyaan.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
I wanted to do something hard.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax adag.
I told you it would not be so.	Waxaan kuu sheegay in aanay sidaas ahaan doonin.
Let me tell you, it's not true.	Aan kuu sheego, sax maaha.
Maybe not.	Malaha malaha.
He should know.	Waa inuu ogaado.
Included.	Ka mid ahaa.
I knew very well.	Aad baan u ogaa.
I want to know everything.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ogaado.
Do not talk about him.	Ha ka hadlin isaga.
Truly a great man.	Runtii nin weyn.
She did that.	Way samaysay taas.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
Just that, he said.	Kaliya taas, ayuu yidhi.
More than enough really.	In ka badan ku filan dhab ahaantii.
That was a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
Good day.	Maalin wanaagsan.
It is everything, everywhere.	Waa wax kasta, meel kasta.
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
No one should have done that.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu taas sameeyo.
I think he was in it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu ku jiray.
He took it well.	Si fiican ayuu u qaatay.
What we do not say.	Waxa aanu odhan.
But that is enough.	Laakiin taas waa ku filan tahay.
This is still true.	Tani wali waa run.
I'm glad, you, have one.	Waan ku faraxsanahay, adiga, inay mid leedahay.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
I have never seen him here before.	Halkan hore uma arag isaga.
I really want you	aad baan kuu rabaa
This is very good.	Tani waa mid aad u wanaagsan.
She is like someone else.	Waxay la mid tahay qof kale.
You only need me and me.	Waxaad u baahan tahay aniga iyo aniga kaliya.
I say it is also correct.	Waxaan leeyahay sidoo kale waa sax.
I am very scared	Aad ayaan u baqayaa
It's hard to be ready for that.	Way adag tahay in ay taas diyaar u tahay.
Each of us.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
But it was still very difficult.	Laakiin wali waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
I can't say much here yet.	Wax badan kama sheegi karo halkan weli.
I still don't know.	Wali ma garanayo.
That's fine.	Taasi waa fiican tahay.
Not after what has just happened.	Ma aha ka dib waxa hadda dhacay.
I'm not sure how that will happen.	Ma hubo sida ay taasi u dhici doonto.
I had to come back to see you.	Waxay ahayd inaan u soo noqdo si aan kuu arko.
I could not even see.	Xitaa maan arki karin.
Also, that’s a good, well-done thing.	Sidoo kale, taasi waa wax fiican, si fiican loo sameeyay.
I really do not know.	Run ahaantii ma garanayo.
It was everything.	Waxay ahayd wax walba.
Not much.	Ma badna.
No one can hurt you there.	Halkaas cidna kuma yeeli karto.
Now we are friends.	Hadda waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
I heard, everyone heard.	Waan maqlay, qof kastaa wuu maqlay.
That is what they need.	Taasi waa waxa ay u baahan yihiin.
There seems to be nothing to do.	Waxay u egtahay inaysan jirin wax la sameeyo.
Also many good friends.	Sidoo kale saaxiibo badan oo wanaagsan.
Everyone started talking.	Qof kastaa wuxuu bilaabay inuu hadlo.
I have not yet gone home.	Wali guriga maan tagin.
Not just the whole job.	Kaliya maaha shaqada oo dhan.
But he did not come.	Laakiin ma iman.
She really had it all.	Runtii way wada lahayd.
They are very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan yihiin.
There is no luck yet.	Nasiib ma jiro weli.
I think you know.	Waxay ila tahay inaad ogaatay.
A close friend, ready to help a needy friend.	Saaxiib dhow, oo diyaar u ah inuu caawiyo saaxiib baahan.
I can get it	waan heli karaa
Take that as given.	Qaado taas sidii la siiyay.
That would have been a difficult day.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd maalin adag.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
I really didn't want anything.	Runtii waxba maan rabin.
That was the day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin.
You are too small.	Aad baad u yar tahay.
Did he try and got it.	Miyuu isku dayay oo helay.
No money.	Malaha lacag.
'yes'.	' ee'.
He will do that.	Wuu samayn doonaa taas.
She believes me.	Way i rumaysan tahay.
I'm sure she does.	Waan hubaa inay samaynayso.
Maybe very little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u yar.
I still did.	Wali waan sameeyay.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
enough for me.	igu filan aniga.
But it is very big.	Laakiin aad bay u weyn tahay.
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
She had so much.	Waxay lahayd mid aad u badan.
It is really an interesting place.	Runtii waa meel xiiso badan.
There was something strange about it.	Wax la yaab leh ayaa ka jiray.
I really decided that.	Runtii taas ayaan go'aansaday.
He is expected to leave soon.	Dhawaan ayaa la filayaa inuu baxo.
It can be done.	Waa la samayn karaa.
Can't help right now.	Lama caawin karo hadda.
Only you.	Adiga kaliya.
That’s how it was done.	Taasi waa sida loo sameeyay.
I left home.	Waxaan ka tagay guriga.
Even that will be very difficult.	Xitaa taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
I really know that.	Runtii taas waan ogahay.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I have tried it really long.	Waxaan isku dayay runtii waqti dheer.
That would be the place to tell him.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd meesha uu u sheegi lahaa.
I'm really here.	si dhab ah ayaan halkan u joogaa.
I just looked.	Kaliya waan eegay.
There was no chance of doing so.	Ma jirin wax fursad ah oo sidaas lagu sameeyo.
I am very skeptical of that.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay taas.
Can't help.	Lama caawin karo.
It is not time.	Waqti ma aha.
He was here a while ago.	Wax yar ka hor ayuu halkan joogay.
There was something wrong with it.	Wax baa ka jiray.
If he gets enough time he will be great.	Haddii uu helo waqti ku filan wuxuu noqon doonaa mid weyn.
As if he had a place to stay.	Sidii uu lahaa meel uu joogo.
No one liked it.	Qofna ma jeclayn.
This was really good.	Runtii tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
That’s weird, right? 	Taasi waa yaab, sax?
He was surprised.	Waa la yaabay.
They were not there.	Ma aysan joogin halkaas.
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
Anything else, too.	Wax kale, sidoo kale.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
It will not give anything.	Waxba ma siin doonto.
It was hard, hard, hard.	Waxay ahayd mid adag, adag, adag.
I was a little surprised.	Waan yara yaabay.
I love him but I don't know what to do.	Waan jeclahay isaga laakiin ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
No one has everything.	Qofna ma hayo wax walba.
There was much to do,	Waxaa jiray wax badan in la sameeyo,
It's harder, but better.	Way adag tahay, laakiin ka sii fiican.
What cannot happen will not happen.	Wixii aan dhici karin ma dhici doonto.
That will take you right.	Taasi waxay kugu qaadan doontaa si sax ah.
No one seems to be able to help him.	Qofna uma eka inuu isaga caawin karo.
I knew I had no chance.	Waxaan ogaa inaanan fursad u haysan.
What he would say he did not know.	Waxa uu odhan doono ma uu garanayn.
I do not have a job.	Shaqo ma hayo.
It does not come again.	Mar dambe ma yimaado.
You do not want to.	Ma aadan rabin.
I haven't seen him in a while.	In muddo ah ma aan arag isaga.
Everything was amazing to me.	Wax walba waxay igu ahayd wax yaab leh.
You do not have to.	Ma aha in aad.
They live here.	Waxay ku nool yihiin halkan.
It has never been like that.	Weligay sidaas oo kale ma ahayn.
Tell them what.	U sheeg waxa.
you were amazing.	yaab baad ahayd.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
But he was not.	Laakiin ma uusan ahayn.
But everyone.	Laakiin qof walba.
He knew he was not.	Wuu ogaa inuusan ahayn.
As he tells me he loves me.	Sida uu ii sheego wuu i jecel yahay.
He said he had.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu lahaa.
Now he had.	Hadda wuu lahaa.
How can this happen? 	Sidee ku dhici kartaa?
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
But no one can.	Laakiin qofna ma awoodo.
Another one.	Mid kale.
I can give you a job	Waxaan ku siin karaa shaqo
Not much.	Ma badna.
I have to know it better.	Waa inaan si fiican u garanayaa.
Maybe he heard it.	Malaha wuu maqlay.
You will be as good as new.	Waxaad u fiicnaan doontaa sida cusub.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
Now.	Hadda.
She refused.	Way diiday.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
Maybe that's what made him.	Malaha waa waxa isaga dhigay.
I'm sorry to see this going on.	Waan ka xumahay inaan arko kan oo socda.
I just can't go there now.	Kaliya meesha ma aadi karo hadda.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado.
I wanted to be with you, to see why.	Waxaan rabay inaan kula joogo, si aan u arko sababta.
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula hadlo.
He enjoyed the job.	Wuu ka helay shaqada.
Why he said.	Sababta ayuu yidhi.
Not found.	Lama helin.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
Only once more.	Kaliya hal mar oo kale.
I don't know why a man says that.	Ma garanayo sababta uu nin sidaas u leeyahay.
Well done to me.	Si fiican aniga ila fiican.
I'm sure you do.	Waan hubaa inaad samaynayso.
And everyone, really.	Iyo qof walba, dhab ahaantii.
It would be the biggest.	Waxay noqon lahayd tan ugu weyn.
I just wanted to be.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan noqdo.
I do nothing.	Aan waxba qaban.
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
It seems like it doesn't exist.	Waxay la mid tahay inaysan jirin.
I think I need that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan u baahanahay taas.
Do not lie.	Been ha sheegin.
This can be done up to three times.	Tan waxa la samayn karaa ilaa saddex jeer.
He looked younger.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid ka yar.
Which is definitely not true.	Taas oo hubaal aan run ahayn.
But something in me was to do.	Laakiin wax aniga igu jira ayaa ahaa inaan sameeyo.
You are too tall!	Aad baad u dheer tahay!
I can't do much.	Wax badan ma qaban karo.
I have to know what happened to me and why.	Waa inaan ogaado waxa igu dhacay iyo sababta.
And happy.	Oo ku faraxsan.
But they are very small.	Laakiin aad bay u yar yihiin.
Not sure why that still exists.	Ma hubo sababta ay taasi weli tahay.
He said I will let you know.	Wuxuu yidhi waan ku soo sheegi doonaa.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wax aad ka qaban kartaa ma jiraan.
Why? 	Maxaa ka yimid?
Said the former.	Ayuu yidhi kii hore.
I didn’t want to do anything about it.	Ma aanan rabin in aan waxba ku sameeyo.
I did not take it.	Ma qaadan.
Which is not there.	Taas oo aan meesha joogin.
I will tell you tomorrow.	Berri ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa.
Hold on, he said.	Qabo ayuu yidhi.
Obviously she does.	Waxaa cad in ay sameyso.
After a while, we will talk.	Muddo ka dib, waan wada hadli doonaa.
Wherever you are.	Meel kasta oo aad joogto.
And it is still true.	Oo weli waa run.
I have no idea what he needs to do.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu sameeyo.
How to tell how it is.	Sida loo sheego sida ay tahay.
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
Right, same person.	Sax, isku qof.
I can't be anywhere near this.	Ma ahaan karo meel u dhow tan.
Otherwise say nothing.	Haddii kale waxba ha odhan.
Absolutely, nothing.	Dhab ahaantii, waxba.
But you are small.	Laakiin waad yar tahay.
I was smart	caqli baan ahaa
No one can.	Qofna ma awoodo.
That is what it does.	Taasi waa waxa ay sameyso.
But otherwise, nothing.	Laakiin haddii kale, waxba.
No one found you here.	Qofna halkan kuma aadan helin arrintan.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay ha ka xumahay.
a bit lucky.	xoogaa nasiib ah.
Now it’s too much.	Hadda aad bay u badan tahay.
I could not see him.	Anigu ma aan arki karin isaga.
I know she was happy she was.	Waan ogahay inay ku faraxsan tahay inay ahayd.
He often told me beautifully.	Inta badan si qurux badan ayuu ii sheegi jiray.
So far I have made it.	Ilaa hadda waan ka dhigay.
How to do it.	Sida uu yeeli lahaa.
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
He was a white man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin cad.
It looks like he has.	Waxay u egtahay inuu leeyahay.
Surprise is good.	Yaab baa wanaagsan.
I am very happy.	Aad baan u faraxsanahay.
I know he knows.	Waan ogahay inuu yaqaan.
I will not do it, I can not.	Ma yeeli doono, ma awoodo.
You should have been there.	Waxay ahayd inaad halkaas joogto.
In fact, this is true.	Dhab ahaantii, tani waa run.
How smart you are.	Sidee aad u caqli badan tahay.
They are better than that.	Way ka fiican yihiin taas.
That will do the same.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa sidoo kale.
I wanted to see what happened.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko waxa ku dhacay.
She had to say.	Waxay ahayd inuu sheego.
They will help you, he said.	Way ku caawin doonaan ayuu yidhi.
But it can do this.	Laakiin way samayn kartaa tan.
They will come	Way iman doonaan
There really is nothing I can do.	Runtii ma jiraan wax aan sameeyo.
She did not return.	Ma ay soo noqon.
She could not see me.	Way i arki wayday.
He was great and very good.	Waxa uu ahaa helay weyn oo aad u fiican.
Tell them again.	Mar kale u sheeg.
Everyone.	Qof kasta.
This is an interesting idea.	Tani waa fikrad xiiso leh.
He had to do what he had to do.	Waxay ahayd inuu sameeyo wixii uu samayn lahaa.
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
There was no stopping.	Ma jirin wax joojin ah.
I want to take it now	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadda qaado
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
So far, I have not returned.	Ilaa hadda, dib uma soo noqon.
He really liked it.	Aad ayuu uga helay.
I'm sure she has.	Waan hubaa inay leedahay.
I found.	Waan helay.
It is something.	Waa wax.
I wish I had a little.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto wax yar.
Maybe she really did.	Malaha runtii way samaysay.
He wanted to know more.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax badan ogaado.
It is not always a good thing.	Had iyo jeer maaha wax wanaagsan.
He doesn't want to know that.	Ma rabo inuu taas ogaado.
I knew it was bad.	Waan ogaa inuu mid xun yahay.
They don't even like me.	Xitaa aniga ima jecla.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
This is not permanent.	Tani ma aha mid joogto ah.
They may be too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u badan yihiin.
She did not like him.	Ma ay jeclayn isaga.
He looked at me.	Wuu iga eegay.
No one understood.	Qofna ma fahmin.
This can be seen everywhere.	Tan waxaa laga arki karaa meel kasta.
Happy one.	Mid faraxsan.
But he knew he had to do something.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inay tahay inuu wax sameeyo.
In fact, he refused.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu diiday.
It is him.	Waa isaga.
That sounds like a serious problem.	Taasi waxay u egtahay dhibaato adag.
Fikrad! 	Fikrad!
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
He had enough time already.	Waxa uu lahaa waqti ku filan mar hore.
It is one after the other.	Waa hal ka dib.
But that is really late.	Laakiin taasi runtii waa dambe.
That is, as long as you are here for that.	Waa taas, ilaa inta aad halkan u joogto taas.
This is not the case either.	Tani ma aha sidoo kale.
Everyone needs to do that.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu taas sameeyo.
But not without chance.	Laakiin maaha fursad la'aan.
She certainly did.	Hubaal way samaysay.
I often wonder if this is how everyone feels.	Waxaan inta badan la yaabanahay in tani ay tahay sida qof walba dareemayo.
I have never seen him so happy.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo aad u faraxsan.
You would love to.	Waad jeclaan lahayd.
There are no problems.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
I will talk to him.	Waan la hadli doonaa.
I think this is true.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay sax tahay.
It is often bad.	Inta badan waa xun.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin tani sidaas maaha.
That could be.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa.
Definitely better than nothing.	Wax hubaal ah ayaa ka wanaagsan waxba.
Not the one I like.	Ma aha kan aan jeclahay.
That is not what happened.	Taasi maaha wax ku dhacay.
They will need you.	Way kuu baahan doonaan.
Do not talk to me.	Ha ila hadlin.
There is no way to find out.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado.
I refused to want anything but you.	Waxaan diiday in aan rabo wax aan adiga ahayn.
She said loudly.	Aad bay u tidhi.
I don’t want anything else to do with him.	Ma doonayo wax kale oo aan isaga la sameeyo.
Probably very new.	Malaha aad u cusub.
I can't find one	Mid ma heli karo
I took it.	waan qaatay.
What he says is.	Waxa uu leeyahay waa.
This is difficult.	Tani waa adag tahay.
They really do.	Runtii way sameeyaan.
Not too much.	Aad uma badna.
You did well.	Si fiican ayaad u samaysay.
I need more.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
It would be nice to say more.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in wax badan la sheego.
But for me it was, surprisingly.	Laakiin aniga waxay ii ahayd, si yaab leh.
More than enough.	In ka badan oo ku filan.
That is really hard.	Runtii taasi waa adag tahay.
Three years later.	Saddex sano ka dib.
He has a friend he wants.	Waxa uu leeyahay saaxiib uu rabo.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
You had me.	Waad i lahayd.
The former is now a lie.	Kii hore hadda waa been.
I really did what you said.	Runtii waxaan sameeyay waxaad tidhi.
He has to eat.	Waa inuu wax cuno.
If you love someone, tell them.	Haddii aad qof jeceshahay, u sheeg.
I just want to be the best.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo kan ugu fiican.
No problem'	Dhib ma leh'
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I think you are.	Waxaan filayaa inaad tahay.
Probably the former.	Malaha kii hore.
I don't like that.	Ma jecla taas.
It was a sight to behold.	Waxay ahayd meel la arko.
She didn't believe us.	Way na rumaysan wayday.
I'm sure I will.	Waan hubaa inaan sameyn doono.
It’s all very complicated, really.	Dhammaan waa wax aad u adag, runtii.
Not many, but few.	Ma badna, laakiin wax yar.
There is no charge for this.	Ma jiro wax lacag ah tan.
No one is so happy.	Qof sidaas u faraxsan ma jiro.
I was surprised she could talk.	Waxaan la yaabay inay hadli karto.
Don't tell me.	Ha ii sheegin.
Tell me where	Meesha ii sheeg
You must promise me that you will not go.	Waa inaad ii ballan qaado inaadan tagi doonin.
Ma tan.	Ma tan.
But that is not the main thing.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ugu weyn.
Well I was set to do that now.	Si fiican ayaa la ii meel dhigay inaan taas sameeyo hadda.
Love nothing to talk about.	Jeclaan waxba in laga hadlo.
He is alive now.	Hadda wuu nool yahay.
That wasn’t a big deal, either.	Taasi wax weyn ma ahayn, sidoo kale.
I am not a person and not everyone.	Anigu ma ihi qof iyo qof kasta.
what are you saying?.	maxaad leedahay?.
I felt it.	Waan dareemay.
Not now, too early.	Hadda ma aha, goor hore.
No one really knew what was going on.	Runtii qofna ma ogayn waxa socda.
I really had no idea.	Run ahaantii wax fikrad ah kama haysan.
They are difficult.	Way adag yihiin.
I will never do that.	Weligay taas ma yeeli doono.
If you do this, do not stop.	Haddii aad tan samayso, ha joojin.
She said something.	Wax bay tidhi.
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
They may be happy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay faraxsan yihiin.
I was in a good place.	Meel fiican ayaan joogay.
I have nothing to do	Wax aan sameeyo ma hayo
You can be the best you can be.	Waxaad noqon kartaa sida ugu fiican ee aad noqon karto.
At first it looks good.	Markii hore waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
I have not done it yet.	Wali maan samayn.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I do nothing wrong.	Wax xun ma sameeyo.
You can not say anything.	Waxba ma odhan kartid.
That's when he said.	Waa markii uu yidhi.
I know she did.	Waan ogahay inay samaysay.
No one left.	Qofna uma tagin.
Please, don't take me lightly.	Fadlan, si xun ha ii qaadan.
You need to know everything.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad wax walba ogaato.
But he could not stop.	Laakiin wuu joojin waayay.
I don't want to be sorry.	Ma rabo ka xumahay.
He knew he had to do something.	Wuu ogaa inuu wax sameeyo.
He is not a man.	Nin maaha.
I did not like that.	Maan jeclayn taas.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay tahay adiga oo aniga maaha.
So to speak.	Sidaas in la hadlo.
There is less than yesterday.	Waxaa jira wax ka yar shalay.
There is nothing less.	Wax kale ma jiraan wax ka yar.
This was too much for me.	Tani waxay ahayd oo ay ii dheer tahay aniga.
This is what it looks like.	Tani waa waxa ay u egtahay.
For a while nothing was said.	In muddo ah waxba lama odhan.
And maybe it is.	Oo laga yaabo inay tahay.
I am very sure of that.	Aad ayaan u hubaa taas.
I would really like to see that.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko.
Either way he said.	Si kasta oo uu yidhi.
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
He has time, and more.	Wuxuu leeyahay waqti, iyo wax badan.
All right now.	Dhammaan hadda.
It is not interesting.	Ma ahan mid xiiso badan.
There is something similar at work.	Wax la mid ah ayaa ku jira shaqada.
But even that now does not do much good.	Laakiin xitaa taasi hadda wax badan oo wanaagsan ma samaynayso.
I knew that was true.	Waan ogaa inay taasi run tahay.
He took it quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u qaatay.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
He seemed happy that the rest did not come.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan in inta kale aanay iman.
You need one.	Waxaad u baahan tahay mid.
Just do it again.	Kaliya inaad mar kale sameyso.
Not really that bad.	Dhab ahaantii sidaas uma xun.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
Really love him.	Runtii isaga jecel.
He could not tell me why.	Sababta ayuu ii sheegi waayay.
He wants to do it for you.	Wuxuu rabaa in uu adiga kugu sameeyo.
I know you, now.	Waan ku garanayaa, hadda.
This is what came to him.	Tani waa waxa isaga u yimid.
I went there.	Halkaas ayaan aaday.
It will still be better than most.	Weli wuu ka fiicnaan doonaa inta badan.
It was no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma ahayn.
He is nearby.	Meel u dhow ayuu joogaa.
It still needs some work.	Weli waxay u baahan tahay xoogaa shaqo ah.
I went to talk to him.	Waxaan u tagay inaan la hadlo.
I can't today.	Maanta ma awoodo.
He would get a good job.	Shaqo fiican buu heli lahaa.
We need you	Waanu kuu baahanahay
And good, that.	Iyo mid wanaagsan, taas.
I didn’t have enough time.	Ma haysan waqti igu filan.
He would do it.	Wuu samayn lahaa.
I saw it once.	Mar baan arkay.
I told him the truth.	Run baan u sheegay.
They will tell you what cannot be done and why.	Waxay kuu sheegi doonaan waxa aan la samayn karin iyo sababta.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
There was just no place to go there.	Kaliya ma jirin meel laga tago halkaas.
He walked in the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka soo galay.
There was so much now.	Hadda wax badan baa jiray.
It's a great idea.	Waa fikrad aad u fiican.
It's a big job.	Waa shaqo weyn.
see you soon !.	is arag dhawaan!.
Take this here.	Halkan qaado tan.
Let me get you that.	Aan kuu helo taas.
It sounds complicated.	Waxay u egtahay mid adag.
I am the one now.	aniga ayaa ah kan hadda.
I knew this was a big problem.	Waan ogaa in tani ay tahay dhibaato weyn.
You can no longer leave.	Mar dambe ma bixi kartid.
This could not be better.	Tani ma fiicnaan karto.
Bad, very bad.	Xun, aad u xun.
This is now.	Tani waa hadda.
He thought that would happen.	Waxa uu mooday in ay taasi dhici doonto.
I will say it again.	Mar kale ayaan odhan doonaa.
That doesn't feel right.	Taas sax uma dareemayo.
You really want it.	Runtii aad rabto.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
I hope he does.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameeyo.
You may not get another chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan helin fursad kale.
He looked so good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u fiican.
All you can be is you.	Dhammaan waxaad noqon kartaa waa adiga.
He had little to say.	Waxa uu lahaa wax yar oo uu sheego.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
Still, he did.	Weli, wuu sameeyay.
I just can't help it.	Kaliya ma caawin karo.
It was the same every day.	Maalin walba isku mid bay ahayd.
It will be busy here.	Waxay noqon doontaa mashquul halkan.
I wish you were right.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad run tahay.
Really, really good.	Runtii, aad u fiican.
I would expect less.	Waxaan filan lahaa wax ka yar.
Please can you help me with that.	Fadlan ma iga caawin kartaa taas.
Same thing again.	Wax la mid ah mar kale.
She could not leave.	Waa ay bixi wayday.
I got that from you	Taas adiga ayaan kaa helay
I can't get enough.	Wax igu filan ma heli karo.
They are just there, and they are what they are.	Waxay yihiin oo kaliya halkaas, oo waxay yihiin waxa ay yihiin.
But it did not help.	Laakiin ma ay caawin.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I really saw that.	Runtii taas waan arkay.
I want that now.	Taas hadda ayaan rabaa.
If available.	Haddii la heli karo.
There was only one person.	Waxaa jiray hal qof oo kaliya.
not yet.	weli ma aha.
Do not tell anyone about this.	Cidna taas ha u sheegin.
To be known.	In la ogaado.
I wish I had more time.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan waqti badan helo.
It was a very long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti aad u dheer.
Here are a few of them.	Halkan waxaa ah dhowr ka mid ah.
That is certainly true.	Hubaal taasi waa sax.
But really.	Laakiin si dhab ah.
I know who.	waan garanayaa yaa.
He did this.	Waxa uu sameeyay tan.
I really don't understand that.	Runtii taas ma fahmin.
I'm sorry.	waan ka xumahay.
I still haven't found it	Wali ma helin
But no one does that.	Laakiin qofna taas ma sameeyo.
That will be fine.	Taasi way fiicnaan doontaa.
It has a lot to offer.	Wax badan bay leedahay.
Please tell me what happened.	Fadlan ii sheeg waxa dhacay.
Everyone wants it.	Qof kasta oo uu doono ayaa jira.
You do not need to know.	Uma baahnid inaad ogaato.
I got it, but it really isn’t.	Waan helay, laakiin run ahaantii ma aha.
But there are other things as well.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo sidoo kale ah.
But it will not.	Laakiin ma yeeli doono.
I will be with you.	waan kula joogi doonaa.
Does anyone know?	Ma jiraa qof wax yaqaan?
It's really that bad.	Runtii waa sidaas u xun.
Everyone has something to say.	Qof kastaa wax uu ka odhan lahaa.
Great house.	Guriga weyn.
That could not be helped.	Taasi waa la caawin waayay.
What else do I need, really.	Maxaa kale oo aan u baahanahay, runtii.
It was a little.	Waxay ahayd wax yar.
I would get more	Wax badan ayaan heli lahaa
We love each other.	Waanu is jeclayn.
There must be something she can do to help him.	Waa inay jiraan wax ay samayn karto si ay isaga u caawiso.
You know, we can't do much of this.	Waad ogtahay, ma samayn karno wax badan oo tan ah.
People who love him.	Dadka isaga jecel.
She has a new job, a job, and friends.	Waxay leedahay shaqo cusub, shaqo, iyo saaxiibo.
He did not speak.	Uma hadlin.
But they will come.	Laakiin way iman doonaan.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
It is the right thing to do.	Waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
I have something to say.	waxaan leeyahay wax aan sheego.
She didn't need to be there.	Uma baahnayn inay halkaas joogto.
I want to see you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko.
Stop that!	Jooji taas!
It was really hard.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid adag.
amazing, isn't it?	yaab leh, saw maaha?
I need to go and see him.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago oo aan arko isaga.
I just lost a friend.	Kaliya waxaan waayay saaxiib.
I can do this.	Waan samayn karaa tan.
I went out and left.	Waan baxay oo baxay.
This is for you for sure.	Tani waa adiga oo la hubaa.
I thought it was you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
She didn't like him enough.	In ku filan uma ay jeclayn isaga.
I would like to go	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan tago
You can pay for it.	Waad bixin kartaa isaga.
Everything else was great.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa ahaa mid weyn.
He went to pick it up.	Wuu aaday inuu soo qaado.
I wanted to work with you	Waxaan rabay inaan kula shaqeeyo
You will find work here.	Shaqo ayaa halkan ka heli doona.
Good luck!.	Nasiib wanaagsan!.
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
I don't feel real.	Wax run ah ma dareemayo.
There was no money for that.	Ma jirin wax lacag ah taas.
I would like him to say something, as he knows.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu wax sheego, sida wuxuu yaqaan.
Maybe that was it too.	Malaha taasi waxay ahayd sidoo kale.
No one wants anything.	Qofna waxba ma rabo.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
He told me I couldn’t find anything.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aan waxba u helin.
Several other men entered.	Dhowr nin oo kale ayaa soo galay.
In fact, maybe for sure.	Dhab ahaantii, malaha waa hubaal.
There were more cars than ever before.	Waxaa jiray baabuur ka badan sidii hore.
It is not quick but it can be done.	Ma aha mid degdeg ah laakiin waa la samayn karaa.
What a good friend.	Maxaa saaxiib wanaagsan.
That is today.	Taasi waa maanta.
This was enough for him.	Tani waxay ahayd mid ku filan isaga.
She said it was true.	Waxay tidhi waa run.
I don't get it.	ma helo.
I would love to do it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo.
I'm sure you will do well.	Waxaan hubaa inaad si fiican wax u qaban doonto.
That we are surprised.	In ay nagu tahay yaab.
One day.	Hal maalin.
But he did not do much work.	Laakiin shaqo badan ma uusan qaban.
I know him very well.	Aad ayaan u garanayaa isaga.
Yes.	Waa.
I'm not sure if there is anything else.	Ma hubo inay wax kale jiraan.
To do this again.	Si aad taas mar kale u sameyso.
'has'.	' leeyahay'.
Let me tell you what happened.	Aan kuu sheego waxa dhacay.
I was unable to return.	Ma awoodin inaan noqdo.
This would happen very quickly.	Tani waxay u dhici lahayd si degdeg ah.
And more.	Oo ka badan.
That is what is happening here.	Taasi waa waxa halkan ka socda.
There is no one near you.	Mid kuu dhow ma jiro.
I gave you every opportunity.	Waxaan ku siiyay fursad kasta.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
She was right.	Sax bay ahayd.
But this is not true	Laakiin tani sax maaha
I had to stay with him.	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga la joogo.
So much more please.	Wax aad u badan fadlan.
He knows the place well.	Meesha si fiican ayuu u yaqaan.
I had an idea.	Waxaan lahaa fikrad.
I tried and tried	waan isku dayay oo isku dayay
It will do.	Way yeeli doontaa.
He has a job.	Shaqo buu leeyahay.
She told me it all.	Waxay ii sheegtay dhammaan.
I am happy for several.	Waan ku faraxsanahay dhowr.
It would be small.	Wax yar bay ahaan lahayd.
I was busy.	mashquul baan ahaa.
I love you, you know that.	Waan ku jeclahay, waad ogtahay taas.
And a day later as well.	Iyo maalin ka dib sidoo kale.
That is too much.	Taasi waa mid aad u badan.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
I knew that a long time ago.	Waan ogaa taas wakhti dheer ka hor.
You can stay as long as you want.	Waad joogi kartaa inta aad rabto.
No one can help me in the best way.	Qofna ma ii caawin karaa sida ugu wanaagsan.
But there was not much.	Laakiin ma jirin wax badan.
But it was true.	Laakiin run bay ahayd.
Not even a little.	Xitaa wax yar maaha.
I can't do it now	Hadda ma samayn karo
That is.	Taasi waa .
Most of the time there was no problem.	Inta badan dhib ma jirin.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
He did not tell.	Uma uu sheegin.
That alone is interesting.	Taas oo kaliya ayaa ah mid xiiso leh.
In you.	In adiga.
I was not here.	halkaan uma joogin.
I have things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan sameeyo.
I'm afraid to talk to him again.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan dib ula hadlo.
Catch! 	Qabo!
It can help if you need it.	Way ku caawin kartaa haddii aad u baahan tahay.
That would be great.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid aad u fiican.
There was no time we could just do it.	Ma jirin waqti aan kaliya sameyn karno.
I felt strange.	Waxaan dareemay wax yaab leh.
He felt hard.	Si dhib ah ayuu u dareemay.
I did something you did not want.	Waxaan sameeyay wax aadan rabin.
She still needs money for everything.	Waxay weli u baahan tahay lacag wax walba.
It is the same today.	Maanta waa sidaas oo kale.
I knew.	Anigu waan ogaa.
He knew he could not succeed.	Wuu ogaa in aanu guulaysan karin.
I want this not to be real.	Waxaan rabaa in tani aysan noqon mid dhab ah.
I do not eat much.	Wax badan ma cuno.
And maybe it was.	Oo laga yaabo inay ahayd.
That was the reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta.
I just want to	Kaliya waan rabaa
I have to find out who did this.	Waa inaan ogaado cidda tan samaysay.
Probably not so much.	Aad u badan malaha.
It has to be done for me now.	Waa in la i sameeyaa hadda.
This is a great job.	Tani waa shaqo aad u fiican.
If so, he would take it.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, wuu qaadan lahaa.
He was not ready for that.	Taas diyaar uma uu ahayn.
Iyo.	Iyo.
Something similar to the other way around.	Wax la mid ah si kale.
That didn't cost anything.	Taasi wax lacag ah kama bixin.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
There is nothing new here.	Ma jiro wax cusub halkan.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
I think it is something like that.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I have to go	waa inaan tago
Not a good place.	Meel fiican ma aha.
I have heard a lot.	Wax badan baan maqlay.
This may be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa run.
They did not.	Ma ay lahayn.
I don't think he was.	Uma maleynayo inuu ahaa.
I am so happy to see you again.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko.
I would like	waan jeclaan lahaa
I wanted to know how it went.	Waxaan rabay in aan ogaado sida uu uga baxay.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
There was nothing else.	Wax kale ma jirin.
It's just.	Waxa kaliya.
It has several others.	Waxay leedahay dhowr kale.
That surprises me.	Aniga taasi waa iga yaab.
But they are a bit the same.	Laakiin xoogaa way isku mid yihiin.
It sounds bad, you know.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun, waad ogtahay.
It should not cost anything.	Waa in aanay waxba bixin.
That is a very difficult job.	Taasi waa shaqo aad u adag.
You know it's true.	Waad ogtahay inay run tahay.
You can still come back	Wali waad soo noqon kartaa
I need new money.	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag cusub.
I wanted many things at once.	Waxaan rabay waxyaabo badan hal mar.
First, it is all inclusive.	Marka hore, dhammaan waa loo wada dhan yahay.
Not sure what is going on.	Ma hubo waxa socda.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
You are a busy man.	nin mashquul ah ayaad tahay.
Yes, indeed.	Waa, runtii.
He didn't want me to tell you.	Ma uu rabin in aan kuu sheego.
You will see this.	Tani waad arki doontaa.
Maybe someone told him.	Malaha qof baa u sheegay.
Enough of this.	Waxay ku filan tahay tan.
Everyone else knew, but not me.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa ogaa, laakiin aniga ma ahayn.
I just got it	Kaliya waan helay
I do not like that.	Ma jecli taas.
That doesn't matter now.	Taasi hadda waxba maaha.
A place of trouble.	Meel dhib ah.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
I don't know if it's true or not.	Ma garanayo inay run tahay iyo in kale.
You are really beautiful.	Runtii waad qurux badan tahay.
No one else can.	Qof kale ma heli karo.
Everything and everyone.	Wax walba iyo qof walba.
This is certainly not surprising.	Hubaal tani maaha mid la yaab leh.
He told him maybe.	Waxa uu u sheegay in laga yaabo.
Most of the latter.	Inta badan kan dambe.
I don't want to do it.	Ma rabo inaan sameeyo.
Great job.	Shaqo weyn.
He would see.	Wuu arki lahaa.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa.
I just did.	Kaliya waan sameeyay.
I did more than anyone else would.	Waxaan sameeyay wax ka badan inta qof kale samayn lahaa.
He was surprised and surprised.	Wuxuu la yaabay inuu yaabay.
You must not do anything.	Waa inaadan waxba samayn.
A man was found.	Nin baa la helay.
Much can be found here	Wax badan ayaa halkan laga heli karaa
.	.
Always, no problem.	Had iyo jeer, dhib ma leh.
I can not take this.	Ma qaadan karo tan.
He knows why.	Wuu garanayaa sababta.
Just take it.	Kaliya qaado.
It is very beautiful.	Aad ayuu u qurux badan yahay.
This is difficult, and difficult.	Tani waa adag tahay, oo dhib badan.
I did not want to say.	Ma doonayn inaan sheego.
Now and then.	Hadda iyo ka dib.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
What did he say?	Muxuu yidhi?
He clearly knows me very well.	Si cad aad ayuu ii garanayaa.
Probably a good idea.	Malaha fikrad fiican.
I still haven't found it.	Wali maan helin.
Let me find out.	Aan helo.
They may not know each other, really.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan is ogeyn, dhab ahaantii.
Let me tell you.	In aan kuu sheego.
Really nice guy.	Runtii nin fiican.
They will not.	Ma yeeli doonaan.
I don't want to make any promises.	Ma doonayo inaan wax ballan qaado.
He was surprised.	Wuu la yaabay.
She would pay.	Way bixin lahayd.
He really didn't do anything to find out.	Runtii ma uu samayn wax uu ku ogaado.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I have to help	Waa inaan caawiyo
It doesn't look the same.	Wax isku mid ah uma eka.
They will tell you.	Way kuu sheegi doonaan.
Here it is.	Halkan ku.
All a good time.	Dhammaan waqti wanaagsan.
It was fun, very, very.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh, aad iyo aad.
anything else! 	wax kale!
I will get better	Waan sii fiicnaan doonaa
I can go there	Waan tagi karaa halkaas
Iyo.	Iyo .
It was not him.	Ma ahayn isaga.
He had to say something.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax sheego.
There is	Waxaa jira
Here were some beautiful things.	Halkan waxaa ahaa waxyaabo qurux badan.
This is a new day.	Tani waa maalin cusub.
Maybe it was everything else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd wax kale oo dhan.
It’s what we need from everything.	Waa waxa aan uga baahanahay wax kasta.
That is if they do.	Taasi waa haddii ay sameeyaan.
Not sure.	Ma hubo runtii.
I'm sure he got it.	Waan hubaa inuu helay.
I will never say the same thing.	Weligay ma odhan doono wax la mid ah.
I am a little bit for that.	Waxaan u ahay xoogaa yar taas.
I am very happy to see you.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
Sure, it will take some hard work.	Hubaal, waxay qaadan doontaa xoogaa shaqo adag ah.
They do not exist now.	Hadda ma jiraan.
Very happy little.	Aad u faraxsan in yar.
This has not been done so far.	Tan ilaa hadda lama samayn.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
She looks like a good guy.	Waxay u egtahay nin fiican.
He is obviously sorry about this.	Sida iska cad wuu ka xun yahay arrintan.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
If you want to do that, fine.	Haddii aad rabto inaad taas samayso, fiican.
I am not wanted.	Ma ihi qof la doonayo.
Now you can get everything.	Hadda waxaad heli kartaa wax kasta.
He is missing now.	Waa la waayay hadda.
I wish he was here.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan joogo.
It is something they have to do.	Waa wax ay tahay in ay sameeyaan.
I had to go.	Waxay ahayd inaan u tago.
He thought so.	Sidaas ayuu u maleeyay.
To this day they are close friends.	Ilaa maanta waa saaxiibo dhow.
I like to buy things	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax ka iibsado
It has to be really big.	Waa in ay dhab ahaantii aad u weyn tahay.
No one came.	Ma jiro nin meesha yimid.
It was definitely what he didn't need.	Waxay ahayd hubaal waxa uusan u baahnayn.
They are very interesting to me.	Way ii xiiso badan yihiin.
You must	Waa inaad
It was busy.	Mashquul bay ahayd.
I really have to work on that.	Runtii waa inaan taas ka shaqeeyo.
I wanna leave	waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
I thought it was a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ahayd fikrad fiican.
You can and will do it.	Waad samayn kartaa oo waad samayn doontaa.
I want to know how you feel about me.	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado sida aad aniga igu tahay.
A lot, a lot of me.	Wax badan, aniga oo badan.
It has to be good.	Waa inay fiican tahay.
You are too small.	Aad baad u yar tahay.
It's a short time	Waa wakhti yar
I know that very well.	Waan ogahay taas si fiican.
Is there anything you can do about it?	Ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto taas?
When it is correct, correct.	Marka ay sax tahay, sax.
You will be out soon	Dhawaan ayaad u soo bixi doontaa
They will probably do it.	Waxay u badan tahay inay samayn doonaan.
This was exactly what he wanted.	Tani waxay ahayd sidii uu rabay.
I can't find it	La igama heli karo
So far, it has not been interesting.	Ilaa hadda, ma ahayn wax xiiso leh.
I know what you want.	Waan ogahay waxaad rabto.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko.
You may not be able to do it alone.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan awoodin inaad keligaa sameyso.
I would like something similar.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax la mid ah.
You can help me a lot.	Wax badan ayaad i caawin kartaa.
It is something to be seen.	Waa wax la arko.
I know who this is.	Waan garanayaa waa kuma kan.
It is better everywhere.	Meel walba wuu ka fiican yahay.
I didn't see anything.	Waxba ma arag.
You	Adiga
This can be a very difficult idea.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa fikrad aad u adag.
No one knew anything.	Qofna waxba ma ogayn.
He really refused.	Runtii wuu diiday.
It was a bad thing right.	Waxay ahayd wax xun sax.
As much as she wants.	Inta ay rabto.
I wish you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad.
Let me tell you.	Aan kuu sheego isaga .
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
They will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma yeeli doonaan.
It was again.	Waxay ahayd mar kale.
But she had friends.	Laakiin waxay lahayd saaxiibo.
It's hard to see him continue.	Way adag tahay in la arko isaga oo sii socda.
It was too late.	Mashquul goor dambe ayuu ahaa.
He shouldn't have come, he thinks.	Ma ahayn inuu yimaado, ayuu is leeyahay.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
I was very busy.	mashquul badan ayaan ahaa.
There are many good things to learn.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan oo la barto.
I could not see	Ma arki karin
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ilaa hadda qofna ma awoodo.
It's too bad you won't see him again.	Waxaa aad u xun inaadan dib u arki doonin isaga.
After a long time he came back.	Muddo dheer ka dib ayuu soo noqday.
This is where you can help us.	Tani waa meesha aad naga caawin karto.
I just want you to be with us, please.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad nala joogto, fadlan.
But she would like one.	Laakiin way jeclaan lahayd mid.
I am very happy about this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
It needs to be known.	Waxay u baahan tahay in mid la ogaado.
You need to know what it is.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxa uu yahay.
I didn't think it would really go away.	Uma malaynayn inay dhab ahaan tagi doonto.
I'm sure there is nothing wrong with that.	Waxaan hubaa in aysan meesha waxba ka jirin.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
But it is really clear.	Laakiin run ahaantii waa cad cad.
Good day!	Maalin wanaagsan!
I wanted to.	Waxaan rabay inaan.
Nothing big, nothing big.	Wax weyn ma jiraan, wax weyn ma jiraan.
When he got home, he never stayed that long.	Markii uu yimid guriga, waligiis ma sii joogin waqti dheer.
Another problem was money.	Dhibaato kale ayaa ahayd lacag.
She can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban karto.
Absolutely really.	Dhab ahaantii dhab ahaantii dhab ahaantii.
He is a beloved man.	Waa nin la jecel yahay.
It is always a place.	Had iyo jeer waa meel.
I really need to talk to him.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga.
Everything is really this.	Wax walba run ahaantii tan.
We can't take this.	Ma qaadan karno tan.
No one else had a chance to comment.	Qof kale ma helin fursad uu wax ku sheego.
We'll see more of that tomorrow.	Wax badan ayaan arki doonaa berrito taas.
This is really true.	Runtii tani waa run.
It was felt.	Waa la dareemay.
Obviously they do.	Waxaa cad inay sameeyaan.
I want to know who did it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda samaysay.
he would like that.	wuu jeclaan lahaa taas.
A long time ago.	Waqti dheer oo tagay.
I'm sure someone will get it.	Waxaan hubaa in qof uu heli doono.
They are not bad.	Ma aha inay xun yihiin.
Everyone knows everyone.	Qof walba waa yaqaan qof walba.
He is with us.	Waa nala joogaa.
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
I think both are true.	Waxaan filayaa in labaduba run yihiin.
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba kama qaban.
That is what really happened.	Taasi waa waxa dhab ahaantii dhacay.
Surprise,	Yaab,
He decided to stay.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu joogo.
All in all, he couldn't.	Isku wada mid, wuu awoodi waayay.
Definitely there.	Waa hubaal halkaas.
It will be a great time !.	Waqti fiican ayaa noqon doona!.
You can stay	Waad joogi kartaa
That will tell you if you will get better.	Taasi waxay kuu sheegi doontaa haddii aad fiicnaan doonto.
So far, nothing.	Ilaa hadda, waxba.
He does it every day.	Maalin walba wuu sameeyaa.
I got an idea.	Waxaan helay fikrad.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
No one is very happy.	Mid aad u faraxsan ma jiro.
I didn't see anything.	Wax aan arko ma jirin.
I was surprised he was one.	Waxaan la yaabay inuu mid yahay.
I had a wonderful time.	Waxaan helay waqti qurux badan.
I don’t always do it.	Mar walba ma sameeyo.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
She should know better.	Waa inay si fiican u ogaato.
Nothing was done.	Ma jirin wax la sameeyay.
They will do what they love.	Waxay samayn doonaan waxay jecel yihiin.
That was a very good idea.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
They are alive, he said.	Way nool yihiin ayuu is yidhi.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
I was like	Waxaan ahaa sida
He knows what you need.	Wuu garanayaa waxaad u baahan tahay.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
This is really hard.	Tani runtii waa mid adag.
To not be found.	Si aan loo helin.
He said he could not help it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu caawin karin.
Time would tell.	Waqti ayaa sheegi lahaa.
Maybe that’s too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ay aad u badan tahay.
But we can not get that.	Laakiin taas ma heli karno.
There you will see it.	Halkaas baad ku arki doontaa.
I just looked.	Kaliya waan eegay.
tell me what you want me to be.	ii sheeg waxaad rabto inaan noqdo.
It really is.	Runtii waa sidaas.
He still had things to do.	Waxa uu weli lahaa waxyaabo uu sameeyo.
Not small.	Ma yara.
You do not have to pay in advance.	Waa inaadan hore u bixin.
I will do so.	Waan samayn doonaa sidaas.
He refused to see you.	Wuu diiday inuu ku arko.
I'm very happy	aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
That could not be.	Taas kuma noqon karin.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
He did not do everything right.	Wax walba sax ma uu samayn.
I can do that better than he can.	Taas waan samayn karaa si ka fiican inta uu awoodo.
He took a chance.	Fursad ayuu qaatay.
That was a little difficult.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax yar oo adag.
It was a long time, he felt.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer, ayuu dareemay.
They will tell you nothing.	Waxba way kuu sheegi doonaan.
And because of you.	Iyo sababta oo ah adiga.
We knew it would take some time.	Waxaan ogeyn inay qaadan doonto waqti yar.
I'm not sure if any of that is true.	Ma hubo in mid ka mid ah taasi run tahay.
Maybe you are.	Malaha waxaad tahay.
Really, really, I hope so.	Runtii, runtii, waxaan rajeynayaa.
You can always talk to me.	Mar walba waad ila hadli kartaa.
You will get some tomorrow.	Waxaad heli doontaa xoogaa berrito.
They may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan haysan.
That is enough for me.	Taasi waa igu filan tahay aniga.
I'm glad he found you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu ku helay.
I refused to go.	Waan diiday inaan tago.
But that is not for everyone.	Laakiin taasi maaha qof walba.
I hope you are happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad faraxsan tahay.
She had to do that.	Waxay ahayd in ay samayso taas.
Maybe they will give you more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku siin doonaan wax badan.
There was someone.	Qof baa jiray.
It is nothing new.	Wax cusub maaha.
You can take what you can get.	Waxaad qaadan kartaa waxaad heli karto.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
I love how happy she is.	Waxaan jeclahay sida ay u faraxsan tahay.
I have to go there.	Waa inaan halkaas aado.
I wanted to talk to you.	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo.
He arrived late today.	Wuxuu yimid goor dambe oo maanta ah.
I still don't have it.	Wali maan haysan.
And here it was, it happened again.	Oo halkan waxay ahayd, mar kale dhacay.
But it was the best thing she could do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxa ugu fiican ee ay samayn karto.
what did you do	maxaad samaysay.
Not sure if either.	Ma hubo in sidoo kale.
Gone and unknown.	Tagay oo aan la ogayn.
That is what happened here.	Taasi waa waxa halkan ka dhacay.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
I really don't know anything.	Runtii waxba kama garanayo.
I really don't want to.	Runtii ma doonayo.
It was also not too bad.	Sidoo kale ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
I wondered if it would come out or not.	Waxaan la yaabay inuu soo bixi doono iyo in kale.
But we are good friends.	Laakiin waxaan nahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Nothing and everything.	Waxba iyo wax walba.
I think we can be so much better.	Waxaan qabaa inaan aad uga fiicnaan karno.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jirto.
I lied to him.	been baan u sheegay.
This is what it does.	Tani waa waxa ay sameyso.
He did not want to leave.	Ma uusan rabin inuu baxo.
I can get it again	Mar kale ayaan heli karaa
But it would be better for me to go.	Laakiin way ii fiicnaan lahayd inaan tago.
I think it's a lie.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay been tahay.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
He really could not see anything.	Runtii waxba ma uu arki karin.
I wanted to tell you something.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax kuu sheego.
It will be difficult.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
It is too early	Waa goor hore
It was not money.	Ma ahayn lacag.
I know they are not.	Waan ogahay inaysan ahayn.
But what he now knew was enough.	Laakiin waxa uu hadda ogaa ayaa ku filan.
Just like yesterday.	Sidii shalay oo kale.
No one else is there.	Qof kale meesha ma joogo.
They certainly exist.	Waa hubaal inay jiraan.
I also don’t know if I do it right.	Sidoo kale ma garanayo haddii aan si sax ah u sameeyo.
It will be good for you.	Way kuu fiicnaan doontaa.
The former has been tried.	Tan hore ayaa la isku dayay.
Interesting, very interesting.	Xiiso leh, aad u xiiso badan.
They had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
Hard time, really.	Waqti adag, dhab ahaantii.
Something other than this.	Wax aan ahayn tan.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
He is in you.	Wuu kugu jiraa.
Maybe you did.	Malaha waad samaysay.
You can't help everyone.	Qof walba ma caawin kartid.
Now he is surprised.	Hadda ayuu la yaabay.
That is what it takes more than that.	Taasi waa waxa ay u baahan tahay in ka badan.
Both are also the same.	Labaduba sidoo kale waa isku mid yihiin.
I didn't want her to know now.	Ma jeclayn hadda inay ogaato.
There is a lot of time.	Waxaa jira waqti badan.
I like a lot of things.	Waxaan jeclahay waxyaabo badan.
Here is the man.	Waa kan nin.
But that’s just me.	Laakiin taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
It doesn't look like anything has happened.	Wax dhacay uma eka.
And it was almost time.	Oo waxay ahayd waqti ku dhow.
There is no place like home.	Ma jirto meel guriga oo kale ah.
That is why we are.	Taasi waa sababta aan u nahay.
But it may not be for everyone.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan qof walba u ahayn.
But it will definitely take longer than that.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii waxay qaadan doontaa waqti ka badan taas.
He really didn't want to talk about it.	Runtii ma uu doonayn inuu ka hadlo.
I am not alone.	Kaliya ma ihi.
You do not have to do it every day.	Ma aha in ay tahay in aad samayso maalin kasta.
It really wasn't that big.	Runtii wax weyn ma ahayn.
In the cause.	In sababta.
He found himself doing more.	Waxa uu is arkay in uu samaynayo in ka badan.
She said nothing.	Waxay tidhi waxba maaha.
I know you believe me.	Waan ogahay inaad i rumaysan tahay.
Probably it was.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd.
Maybe he didn't have time to go.	Malaha wakhti uu ku baxo ma helin.
You can do this without any problems.	Tan waxaad samayn kartaa dhib la'aan.
All you need to do is do it.	Kaliya waxaad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso.
He would do nothing for me.	Waxba wuu ii samayn lahaa.
Everyone wants that.	Qof kastaa wuu rabaa taas.
I didn’t have long to do it.	Ma haysan waqti dheer in la sameeyo.
But it will.	Laakiin way yeeli doontaa.
There was so much.	Wax badan baa jiray.
I don't like it being me.	Ma jecli inay aniga tahay.
No one there got a real chance to get a job.	Qofna halkaas fursad dhab ah uma helin inuu shaqo helo.
As you wish.	Sida aad rabto.
The only thing you can do is stay there.	Waxa kaliya ee aad sameyn karto waa inaad halkaas joogto.
I don't want that.	Ma rabo taas.
Not me, everyone else wanted me to be.	Aniga ma aha, qof kasta oo kale ayaa rabay inaan noqdo.
it is old	waa hore
I had to leave.	Waxay ahayd inaan baxo.
They may not come out.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan soo bixin.
Wax.	Wax.
That alone was not a problem.	Kaliya taasi dhib ma lahayn.
I am a real adult.	Waxaan ahay qof weyn oo dhab ah.
They did not pay.	Wax lacag ah ma ay siin.
He thinks so.	Sidaas ayuu qabaa.
A lot is going on.	Wax badan ayaa ka socda.
A lot was seen.	Wax badan ayaa la arki jiray.
We would have found him.	Waanu heli lahayn isaga.
I doubt they will come back again.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay mar kale soo noqon doonaan.
I heard this.	Tan waan maqlay.
Much will come clearly.	Wax badan ayaa si cad u iman doona.
What they do.	Waxa ay sameeyaan.
I want that for you.	Taas ayaan kuu rabaa.
You did very well.	Si aad u wanaagsan ayaad samaysay.
This cannot be true.	Tani dhab ma noqon karto.
Now you can go, if you want.	Hadda waad tagi kartaa, haddii aad rabto.
I know what this looks like, but.	Waan ogahay sida ay tani u egtahay, laakiin.
It's time to do something new.	Waa markii la samayn lahaa wax cusub.
But the reason for it is amazing.	Laakiin sababta ay u tahay ayaa ah mid la yaab leh.
It just doesn’t look good.	Kaliya uma eka mid wanaagsan.
He came later.	Wuu yimid ka dib.
I told you, it was something.	Waxaan kuu sheegay, waxay ahayd wax.
I know how to do that.	Waan ogahay sida loo sameeyo taas.
Take tomorrow too.	Qaado berri sidoo kale.
It was not a lie.	Been ma ahayn.
I'm sure you will do well !.	Waxaan hubaa inaad si fiican wax u qaban doonto!.
It can go at any time.	Waqti kasta way tagi kartaa.
He would just get it.	Kaliya wuu heli lahaa.
Take it if you need to.	Qaado haddii aad u baahan tahay.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
Now, why are you here.	Hadda, sababta aad halkan u joogto.
But I do not know how it works.	Laakiin ma garanayo sida loo shaqeeyo.
I looked very small.	Waxaan u muuqday mid aad u yar.
It doesn't matter who they are.	Wax dhib ah ma leh cidda ay yihiin.
I do not share this.	Ma rabo kan.
All at once.	Dhammaan isku mar.
There must be something they cannot take.	Waa inay jiraan wax aysan qaadan karin.
It was beautiful, too.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan, sidoo kale.
It was a great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
You can find everything there.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa wax kasta halkaas.
He never did anything great.	Waligiis ma uusan sameyn wax weyn.
It's more than that.	Way ka sii badan tahay.
You need to know.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
There is something better in you than anything else.	Waxaa kugu jira wax aad uga wanaagsan wax kasta oo kale.
I just do not.	Kaliya ma sameeyo.
Difficult for everyone, maybe.	Ku adag qof kasta, malaha.
That may not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon karto.
I just do not know how.	Kaliya ma garanayo sida.
You will not let me.	Ima ogolaan doonto.
It is unknown.	Waa wax aan la garanayn.
It is a discovery	Waa wax la helay
The former does not.	Kan hore ma sameeyo.
Now this will not hurt.	Hadda tani waxba ma yeeli doonto.
I didn't think he would.	Uma malaynayn inuu yeeli doono.
I can stop	waan joojin karaa
It's amazing to see.	Waa yaab in la arko.
You will do what you say.	Waad yeeli doontaa waxaad tidhi.
He saw something.	Wax buu arkay.
I will take one day.	Waxaan qaadan doonaa hal maalin.
There was not much to say.	Wax badan oo la odhan jiray ma jirin.
I did it well.	si fiican ayaan u sameeyay.
No one has said this.	Qofna uma sheegin arrintan.
I would give you one.	Mid baan ku siin lahaa.
That was awful, what happened.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun, maxaa dhacay.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
but really, it was a good day.	laakiin runtii, waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
In fact, he does.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu sameeyaa.
We need you	Waanu kuu baahanahay
He did not want to go.	Ma uu rabin inuu tago.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
I am here	waan joogaa
Until they no longer do it.	Ilaa ay mar dambe ma samayn.
He did not get it.	Ma uu helin.
He could not say anything else.	Wax kale ma uu awoodin inuu sheego.
I think they will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inay si fiican u heli doonaan.
Maybe it is.	Malaha waa.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Oo yaa yaqaan, malaha waa.
He can earn a lot more money than I do.	Wuxuu heli karaa lacag aad uga badan aniga.
I think it was right.	Waxaan filayaa inay sax ahayd.
There is another.	Mid kale ayaa jira.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
I didn't think you were.	Uma malaynayn inaad tahay.
She told him.	Way u sheegtay.
No idea has come to him yet.	Weli wax fikrad ah uma iman isaga.
Money is needed.	Lacag ayaa loo baahan yahay.
I can't stay after this.	Ma joogi karo tan ka dib.
It really came to me first.	Runtii aniga ayaa i soo galay markii hore.
I just don’t know where to leave here.	Kaliya ma garanayo meel aan ka tago halkan.
Now you can see me, wherever you are.	Hadda waad i arki kartaa, meel kasta oo aad joogto.
I couldn't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karin.
It can be anywhere.	Waxay noqon kartaa meel kasta.
Now and then.	Hadda iyo ka dib.
In fact, the worst.	Dhab ahaantii, ugu xun.
She did.	Way samaysay.
Well enough.	Si fiican ugu filan.
Something better than school today.	Wax ka fiican dugsiga maanta.
I know that's amazing.	Waan ogahay taasi waa yaab.
They will probably never see it again.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan dib dambe u arki doonin.
I just felt it	Kaliya waan dareemay
I was one of them.	Waxaan ka mid ahaa.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa mid wanaagsan.
What is it for me? 	Waa maxay aniga?
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I would leave	waan bixi lahaa
But she should have known better.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inay si fiican u ogaato.
She will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayso.
He looked great now.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid weyn hadda.
I was there for a while.	Muddo ayaan halkaas joogay.
It has been told in advance.	Goor hore ayaa loo sheegay.
Don't tell anyone.	Cidna ha u sheegin.
There is nothing there.	Waxba meesha ma jiraan.
What was it, he wondered.	Maxay ahayd, wuu yaabay.
A new place every day.	Meel cusub maalin kasta.
Everyone was amazed.	Qof walba aad buu ula yaabay.
This was some time ago.	Tani waxay ahayd waqti ka hor.
I do not want it any other way.	Ma doonayo si kale.
I really felt that way.	Runtii sidaas ayaan dareemay.
I can see you do it.	Waan arki karaa inaad sameyso.
But tell him to do more.	Laakiin u sheeg inuu wax badan sameeyo.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
No one can do it alone.	Qofna keligiis ma samayn karo.
He got this.	Waxa uu helay kan.
Let me see.	Aan arko.
that's what I wanted.	sidaas ayaan rabay.
I do not know anything else.	Ma garanayo wax kale.
You are not alone.	Adiga kaliya maaha.
He could not believe what he was doing now.	Wuu rumaysan waayay waxa uu hadda sameeyay.
She should have done it now.	Waxay ahayd inay hadda sameyso.
Everything is as true as it is now.	Wax walba waa run sida ay hadda tahay.
I can't even properly yet.	Xitaa si sax ah weli uma awoodo.
Probably known.	Malaha waa la yaqaan.
Same thing every time.	Wax la mid ah mar kasta.
What now? 	Hadda waa maxay?
Until she did not do it.	Ilaa ay yeeli wayday.
Now it is, too.	Hadda waa, sidoo kale.
One year ago.	Hal sano ka hor.
I can't tell him.	Ma sheegi karo isaga.
He does this regularly.	Si joogto ah ayuu tan u sameeyaa.
I don't think it will hurt any of us.	Uma maleynayo inay wax yeeli doonto qof naga mid ah.
tell me, tell me.	ii sheeg, ii sheeg.
I do not think it still exists.	U malayn maayo inay weli jirto.
It didn't take long.	Waqti badan ma qaadan.
I want to help you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo.
They love him.	Way jecel yihiin isaga.
That was rejected.	Taasi waa la diiday.
I am somewhere else	meel kale ayaan joogaa
Very, very bad.	Aad iyo aad u xun.
I didn't think it was a big deal.	Uma malaynayn inay wax weyn tahay.
He was not able to do this.	Ma uusan awoodin inuu tan sameeyo.
I just couldn't believe she was so beautiful.	Kaliya ma rumaysan karin inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
Just correct it.	Kaliya ku sax.
I need a little more.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax yar.
It's real and it's fast.	Waa dhab oo waa degdeg.
She is too big for me.	Aad bay iga weyn tahay.
I got this	tan waan helay
He was a bad man.	Nin xun buu ahaa.
I may not have much time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan haysan waqti badan.
It was a very difficult problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato aad u adag.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
She will need a job.	Waxay u baahan doontaa shaqo.
It is as it is now.	Waa sida ay hadda tahay.
We will be here when you need us.	Waxaan joogi doonaa halkan marka aad noo baahan tahay.
I do not have to speak.	Ma aha inaan hadlo.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha.
I think it was.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd.
I can take it	waan qaadan karaa
I know it was you.	Waan ogahay inay adiga ahayd.
I have no idea how to do that.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sidii aan taas u samayn lahaa.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
He wanted more, more.	Wuxuu rabay wax ka badan, wax ka badan.
But he was not.	Laakiin ma uusan ahayn.
I will not lie.	Been sheegi maayo.
She is good at this.	Way ku fiican tahay tan.
I want to know you better.	Waxaan rabaa inaan si fiican kuu ogaado.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
I have one.	Mid baan leeyahay.
I had the opportunity to get to know him.	Waxaan fursad u helay inaan barto isaga.
Most of the time, he didn’t.	Inta badan, ma uusan samayn.
Anything else.	Wax aan taas ahayn.
I don't feel much.	Ma dareemayo in badan.
.	.
She had to go.	Waxay ahayd inuu tago.
It was another time and place.	Waxay ahayd wakhti kale iyo meel kale.
Anyone can do a job.	Qof kastaa shaqo wuu qaban karaa.
There really aren't.	Runtii ma jiraan.
He was alone.	Keligiis buu ahaa.
But that was later.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd markii dambe.
I was a person.	Waxaan ahaa qof.
I got a job.	Waxaan helay shaqo.
I need to know that you can do that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inaad taas samayn karto.
I know this.	Waan ogahay tan.
Not bad.	Ma aha wax xun.
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
You may be at home today.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad guriga joogto maanta.
He is not there now.	Hadda ma joogo halkaas.
It has to be done what it is.	Waa in lagu sameeyo waxa uu yahay.
You can get it, but you don't have it.	Waad heli kartaa, laakiin ma aadan haysan.
That is what it means to me.	Taasi waa waxa ay aniga ila tahay.
I know it is so.	Waan ogahay inay sidaas tahay.
Lots of things like that.	Waxyaabo badan oo sidaas oo kale ah.
So does everyone.	Sidaas oo kale qof walba.
I pretended	waan iska dhigay
For others, not me.	Dadka kale, aniga maaha.
He did not want to say.	Ma uu doonayn inuu sheego.
Until a few years ago.	Ilaa dhowr sano ka hor.
I do not understand, but it is true.	Ma fahmin, laakiin waa run.
Everyone was amazed.	Qof walba wuu yaabay.
He went out.	Wuu u baxay.
There is nowhere else to do it.	Ma jirto meel wax kale lagu sameeyo.
It just won't do.	Kaliya ma yeeli doono.
Just me.	Aniga kaliya.
There must be something we can do.	Waa inay jiraan wax aan sameyn karno.
Now, that was lucky.	Hadda, taasi waxay ahayd nasiib.
I saw it today.	Maanta ayaan arkay.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
It must have.	Waa in ay leedahay.
I think.	Waxaan filayaa.
Another day he thought to himself.	Maalin kale ayuu is yidhi.
There was really nothing that anyone could do for him.	Runtii ma jirin wax uu qof u qaban karo isaga.
You can not say how things will turn out.	Ma sheegi kartid sida ay wax u dhici doonaan.
Would you please do this for me?	Fadlan ma ii samayn kartaa tan?
I like to talk to people.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan dadka la hadlo.
It looks like though.	Waxay u egtahay laakiin.
It is often the same.	Inta badan waa sidaas oo kale.
He got it.	Wuu helay.
If he loves money.	Haddii uu jecel yahay lacag.
We will help you with that.	Waan kaa caawin doonaa taas.
Now let's talk about it.	Hadda aan ka hadlo.
Maybe not too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale.
But there is no time now.	Laakiin wakhti ma jiro hadda.
I just love him.	Kaliya waan jeclahay isaga.
Not a lie, really.	Been maaha, runtii.
He thought this was a good thing.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in tani ay tahay wax wanaagsan.
Now I do not say.	Hadda ma odhan.
It wasn’t real enough.	Ma ahayn mid dhab ah oo ku filan.
Will do this again.	Mar kale ayaa tan samayn doona.
You know, whatever you want to do, it can be done here.	Waad ogtahay, wax kasta oo aad rabto inaad sameyso, halkan ayaa lagu samayn karaa.
I don't like anything else.	Wax kale ma jecla.
And maybe bigger.	Oo laga yaabo inay ka weyn tahay.
There were other good things as well.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo wanaagsan sidoo kale.
And it really was.	Oo runtii waxay ahayd.
I had to tell someone, everyone.	Waxay ahayd inaan qof u sheego, qof kasta.
Everything is given.	Wax walba waa la siiyay.
I don't want anyone to see this.	Ma rabo in qofna arko kan.
They probably won't.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan yeeli doonin.
I thought you were for me.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad aniga ii tahay.
I can give you money.	Waxaan ku siin karaa lacag.
He has not received it for more than a year.	Ma uusan helin wax ka badan hal sano.
He could not find both.	Labaduba wuu heli waayay.
That was to be expected.	Taasi waxay ahayd in la filan karo.
No one went to see him.	Qofna uma tagin inuu soo arko.
But one is enough, for sure.	Laakiin mid ayaa ku filan, hubaal.
I want to know what.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa.
Do something about it now.	Hadda wax ka qabo.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
I have food.	Ma cunto.
It was hard to know.	Waxa uu ahaa mid adag in la ogaado.
I hope you can't say.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaadan sheegi karin.
So far, very good.	Ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan.
I don't think she likes it very much.	Uma maleynayo inay aad u jeceshahay.
I don’t see how we can do it.	Ma arko sida aan u samayn karno.
There was something about him, something.	Wax baa ka jiray isaga, wax .
He seemed to like it.	Waxa uu u muuqday in uu jecel yahay.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
Very good indeed.	Aad u wanaagsan runtii.
Where he wants to go.	Meesha uu rabo inuu aado.
No one likes him.	Qofna ma jecla isaga.
But there are better things to do.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo ka fiican in la sameeyo.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan.
I tried it everywhere.	Waxaan isku dayay meel kasta.
There is nothing to do now.	Hadda wax la sameeyo ma jiraan.
It's me and you.	Waa aniga iyo adiga oo kale.
Great thing, even.	Wax weyn, xitaa.
There was something new all the time, something harder.	Waxaa jiray wax cusub mar kasta, wax ka adag.
Can you see?	Ma arki kartaa?
Which is mostly true.	Taas oo inta badan run ah.
You don't even have to say.	Xitaa uma baahnid inuu sheego.
She had many friends.	Waxay lahayd saaxiibo badan.
It was clear enough.	Waxay ahayd cad ku filan.
I don't know how they do it.	Ma garanayo sida ay u sameeyaan.
There is nothing surprising.	Wax la yaab leh ma jiraan.
But he knew very well.	Laakiin aad buu u ogaa.
Don't tell us anything.	Aan waxba noo sheegin.
Soon everyone else will see it as well.	Dhawaan qof kasta oo kale ayaa arki doona sidoo kale.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
You can do more.	Wax badan ayaad ku samayn kartaa.
But, you can't pay if someone won't get it.	Laakiin, ma bixin kartid haddii qof aanu heli doonin.
They did not succeed much.	Wax badan kuma ay guulaysan.
That will definitely happen soon.	Taasi waa hubaal inay dhawaan dhici doonto.
She probably did a lot more.	Waxay u badan tahay inay samaysay wax badan oo kale.
I do not know what is going on.	Ma garanayo waxa socda.
That is why they do what they do.	Taasi waa sababta ay u sameeyaan waxay sameeyaan.
But that is not a problem.	Laakiin taasi dhib maaha.
No one saw anything.	Qofna waxba ma arag.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Ma rabo inaan sii hadlo.
He was here a while ago.	Wax yar ka hor ayuu halkan joogay.
It will be very good.	Aad ayuu u fiicnaan doonaa.
I really enjoyed this.	Runtii waan ka helay tan.
He may leave me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu iga tago.
That didn't take long.	Taasi waqti badan ma qaadan.
Do not let anyone tell you who you are.	Ha u ogolaan qofna inuu kuu sheego qofka aad tahay.
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
I do not eat.	Ma cunto.
Maybe they still do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli sameeyaan.
I am very happy about this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
You were amazing.	Waxaad ahayd wax yaab leh.
You will leave	Waad bixi doontaa
Tell them what you want.	U sheeg waxa aad ka rabto.
Nothing came out.	Wax soo baxay ma jiraan.
They love it here.	Way jecel yihiin halkan.
They are difficult.	Way adag yihiin.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
I told him everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegay.
Very good indeed.	Aad u wanaagsan runtii.
That is the minimum.	Taasi waa waxa ugu yar.
Maybe we can help each other.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan is caawin karno.
You are good here	Waa ku fiican tahay halkan
For a while.	In muddo ah.
You can talk about it if you want.	Waad ka hadli kartaa haddii aad rabto.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
There was no one there.	Meesha qofna ma jirin.
He was ignorant.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aan waxba ka ogayn.
For the most part, this is not true.	Inta badan, tani run maaha.
Available at any time.	Waa la heli karaa wakhti kasta.
Not much he wants here.	Ma aha wax badan oo uu halkan doonayo.
He’s an interesting guy for sure.	Waa nin xiiso leh hubaal.
I'm glad he'll be there with me.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu halkaas ila joogi doono.
I have nothing here.	Waxba halkan uma hayo.
I would like to know more about this.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado arrintan.
That was bad enough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xun oo ku filan.
I think it will be very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay noqon doonto wax aad u wanaagsan.
I want to do that.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sidaas sameeyo.
They will never do it again.	Mar dambe dib uma samayn doonaan.
I need to know everything.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax walba ogaado.
This looks so beautiful.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid aad u qurux badan.
We had to do that.	Waxay ahayd inaan taas samayno.
That is probably true.	Taasi malaha waa run.
What happened.	Maxaa dhacay.
Really good.	Runtii aad u wanaagsan.
But certainly not anymore.	Laakiin hubaal mar dambe ma jirto.
Probably right.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sax noqon lahayd.
Both are amazing.	Labaduba waa yaab.
I will be a man.	Aniga wuxuu ahaan doonaa nin.
I can't help it.	Ma caawin karo isaga.
No one can leave.	Qofna ma bixi karo.
We are good friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Three of them are still alive.	Saddex ka mid ah ayaa weli nool.
He had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah kama uu haysan.
I am not	ma ihi
They are very happy now.	Hadda aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
I wanted him to leave.	Waxaan rabay inuu baxo.
I love him, you know.	Waan jeclahay isaga, waad ogtahay.
He was not the only one who felt.	Kaliya ma ahayn kan wax dareemay.
I thought that was very beautiful.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi aad u qurux badan tahay.
It was too early.	Waxay ahayd goor hore.
Not now, for sure.	Hadda maaha, hubaal.
You can find me.	Waad ii heli kartaa.
I wanted to say that, for myself.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas u sheego, aniga ahaan.
I can't stay here anymore.	Ma sii joogi karo halkan in ka badan.
It’s not just what I am.	Kaliya maaha wax aan ahay.
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
Every day.	Maalin kasta.
There is still so much.	Weli wax badan ayaa jira.
Very close to home	Aad ugu dhow guriga
I tried again.	Mar kale ayaan isku dayay.
I saw something.	Wax baan arkay.
To speak for myself and so on.	In aan u hadlo aniga iyo wixii la mid ah.
That is not how it is, but it is how it is.	Taasi maaha sida ay tahay, laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
This is a lot of money.	Tani waa lacag aad u badan.
What it is and where it is, I can not say.	Waxa ay tahay iyo meesha ay joogto, ma odhan karo.
Nobody.	Qofna.
They are almost identical.	Waxay ku dhow yihiin inay isku mid yihiin.
It will not be urgent.	Degdeg ma noqon doonto.
I hope he doesn't get it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan heli karin.
I had a good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican.
That's a lot of money.	Taasi waa lacag aad u badan.
His whereabouts are unknown.	Meesha uu aaday lama garanayo.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
I was as surprised as everyone else.	Waxaan la yaabay sida dadka kale.
But it was.	Laakiin waxay ahayd.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
He always saw the best people.	Wuxuu had iyo jeer arki jiray dadka ugu wanaagsan.
This is a little bit the same.	Tani waa wax yar oo isku mid ah.
I want to say something about it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka sheego.
That is the only reason she is here.	Taasi waa sababta kaliya ee ay halkan u joogto.
It was not difficult.	Ma ahayn wax adag.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
Now he just looked.	Hadda wuxuu eegay oo kaliya.
This is very true.	Tani aad bay run u tahay.
To talk about.	In laga hadlo.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
Something new is needed.	Wax cusub ayaa loo baahan yahay.
I want to know how to make one.	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado sida loo sameeyo mid.
She will stay here	Way joogi doontaa halkan
That should be fine, right?	Waa inay fiican tahay sax?.
But you can do it	Laakiin waad samayn kartaa
I think this is a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
I was taken.	Waa la igu qaatay.
Very well done.	Aad u wanaagsan ayaa la sameeyay.
I can't help it.	Ma caawin karo isaga.
And so, too.	Oo waa sidaas, aad u badan.
Even if you are not.	Xitaa haddii aadan ahayn.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
Very good.	Mid aad u wanaagsan.
Like me.	Aniga oo kale.
Now everyone does it.	Hadda qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
Here is what he said.	Waa kan waxa uu yidhi.
He was everything to me.	Wax walba ayuu ii ahaa.
I will not say it again.	Mar dambe ma odhan doono.
He knew what to do.	Wuu ogaa wuxuu samayn lahaa.
I'm sorry she did.	Waan ka xumahay waxay samaysay.
They really should probably do a little more.	Dhab ahaantii waa inay u badan tahay inay wax yar sameeyaan.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
The rest.	Inta kale.
I told him to go and get it.	Waxaan u sheegay inuu aado soo qaado.
This is true for everyone.	Tani waa run qof kasta.
There is no such thing today.	Ma jirto maanta in taasi sidaas tahay.
Being with friends there.	Inaad halkaas saaxiibo la joogto.
But as she said.	Laakiin sida ay u sheegtay.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
In la rabo.	In la rabo.
Great one too.	Mid weyn sidoo kale.
I got enough	Waxaan helay ku filan
He is a good friend.	Waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd mid cad.
I really didn’t want to know.	Runtii ma rabin inaan ogaado.
I can't tell you why.	Sababta ayaan kuu sheegi waayay.
Are they good.	Ma wax wanaagsan yihiin.
I found you a friend.	waan ku helay saaxiib.
I said nothing else.	Wax kale ma odhan.
If they do, they will stop.	Haddii ay sameeyaan, way joojin doonaan.
Not a good idea.	Ma ahan fikrad wanaagsan.
Not much here, however.	Ma aha wax badan halkan, laakiin.
Really, that could be a good thing.	Run ahaantii, taasi waxay noqon kartaa wax fiican.
And you can tell me what happened.	Oo waxaad ii sheegi kartaa waxa dhacay.
It would not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli lahayn.
But there are other issues at stake.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo la isku hayo.
This is the only thing we can do.	Tani waa waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno.
It was here first.	Waxay ahayd halkan marka hore.
This is a beautiful place.	Tani waa meel qurux badan.
I found a very strange man.	Waxaan u helay nin aad u yaab badan.
I need to see him again.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan mar arko isaga.
I liked that.	Waan ka helay taas.
It was not real.	Ma ahayn mid dhab ah.
But not yet.	Laakiin weli sidii hore maaha.
It should be noted.	Waa in la ogaado.
He should leave now.	Waa inuu hadda iska tago.
Everyone made money.	Qof kastaa lacag buu samayn jiray.
Now, no problem.	Hadda, dhib maaha.
I am one of the people.	Waxaan ka mid ahay dadka.
Probably not much.	Malaha wax badan.
Not just me, but everyone.	Aniga kaliya maaha, laakiin qof kasta.
It was really a bad time.	Runtii waxay ahayd wakhti aad u xun.
I don't think that will happen for a while.	U malayn maayo inay taasi dhici doonto muddo.
But really, I do not know what she wants.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, ma garanayo waxay rabto.
They did not.	Ma ay lahayn.
She did not know that he could talk to her like that.	Ma ay garanayn inuu sidaas ula hadli karo.
Today he told me why.	Maanta wuxuu ii sheegay sababta.
Soon, they will come to you.	Dhawaan, way kuu iman doonaan.
Obviously it has something going on.	Sida iska cad waxay leedahay wax u socda.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
Few people are better off.	Dadka yar ayaa ka wanaagsan.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
It was so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas.
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
We will be there soon!	Dhawaan waanu joogi doonaa!
She would not do what she does.	Ma ay samayn lahayd waxay samayso.
I have not seen and here it is.	Maan arag oo waa kan.
It is not too late.	Ma aha goor dambe.
I do not want to see something like this.	Ma rabo inaan arko tan oo kale.
It's an idea, nothing more.	Waa fikrad, wax kale maaha.
You can stay as long as you want.	Waad joogi kartaa inta aad rabto.
Give it to me.	Sii aniga.
A little bit.	Xoogaa yar.
Someone else with you.	Qof kale oo la socda.
Not the same but still good.	Isku mid maaha laakiin weli way fiican tahay.
You can see that.	Waad arki kartaa taas.
I want to work with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
No problem either.	Dhib ma jiraan sidoo kale.
I was really taken aback.	Run ahaantii waa la i kala qaaday.
As he said.	Inta uu yidhi.
Take your time.	Waqti ku qaado.
He couldn't help it, really.	Wuu caawin waayay, runtii.
And give more.	Oo wax badan sii.
He took no chances.	Wax fursad ah ma uu qaadan.
I wanted to, you know that.	Waxaan rabay, waad ogtahay taas.
Something bad was going to happen now.	Wax xun ayaa dhici lahaa hadda.
He holds you.	Wuu ku hayaa.
Someone did everything.	Qof baa wax walba sameeyay.
We will give you everything you need.	Waxaan ku siin doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I wonder what will happen ?.	waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa dhici doona?.
This was home.	Tani waxay ahayd guriga.
He had a good time.	Waqti fiican ayuu qaatay.
They are actually numerous.	Dhab ahaantii way badan yihiin.
You can not stay here!	Halkan ma joogi kartid!
I can't stay	Ma joogi karo
You tried so hard.	Aad isku dayay.
But that is not much.	Laakiin taasi wax badan maaha.
That's how he will see.	Waa sida uu arki doono.
Everything.	Wax kasta.
Over and over again, he tried.	Mar iyo mar kale, wuu isku dayay.
Beautiful, white.	Mid qurux badan, mid cad.
I need money	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag
Like, a real one.	Sida, mid dhab ah.
All in one.	Dhammaan hal.
I couldn't stop anything.	Waxba waan joojin waayay.
I don't want to talk much.	Wax badan ma rabo inaan la hadlo.
Nothing, really.	Waxba ma jiro, runtii.
You are a good man.	nin wanaagsan baad tahay.
Also.	Sidoo kale.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
I am no longer a man.	Anigu nin dambe ma ihi.
It is enough.	Way ku filan tahay.
But he can see you.	Laakiin wuu ku arki karaa.
I did nothing most of the time.	Waxba ma samayn inta badan.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
I love you.	waan ku jeclahay.
You have been alone for a long time.	Muddo kugu filan ayaad keligaa ahayd.
What will happen to him is uncertain.	Waxa ku dhici doona lama hubo.
I can't leave here	Halkan kama bixi karo
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma yeeli doono.
I got a job	Waxaan helay shaqo
That's not just luck.	Taasi maaha oo kaliya nasiib.
You are a better man.	Nin ka fiican baad tahay.
And, I heard.	Oo, waan maqlay.
It really is.	Runtii waa.
It will no longer be a problem.	Dhib dambe ma noqon doono.
Don't do it!	Ha samayn!
I think this can help.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
I want to do more things.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo badan.
I know you did that.	Waan ogahay inaad taas samaysay.
I can find something else to do.	Waxaan heli karaa wax kale oo aan sameeyo.
I just want to go	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan tago
I have to go	waa inaan aado
They will stay here.	Way joogi doonaan halkan.
You do not have to lie.	Uma baahnid inaad been sheegto.
But it was not tonight.	Laakiin caawa ma ahayn.
No one likes him.	Qofna ma jecla isaga.
Everything had to be known.	Wax walba waxay ahayd in la ogaado.
He is three years younger than me.	Saddex sano ayuu iga yar yahay.
After a while, he disappeared.	In yar ka dib, wuu waayay.
I want to be part of it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka mid noqdo.
It will come out.	Way soo bixi doontaa.
There is a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaa jira.
I know what they will say.	Waan garanayaa waxay odhan doonaan.
I am afraid	waxaan ka baqayaa
But it is very interesting.	Laakiin waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
Absolutely no one.	Dhab ahaantii qofna ma jiro.
I don't want a single man.	Ma rabto nin kaliya.
They must.	Waa inay.
He should have been there.	Waxay ahayd inuu halkaas joogo.
They believe.	Way rumaysan yihiin.
I do not want to see it again.	Ma rabo inaan mar kale arko.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
Obviously it was a lie.	Sida cad waxay ahayd been.
The reason for this is not difficult to find.	Sababta tani maaha mid adag in la helo.
It would be good to do the same.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso.
I can't do anything else.	Wax kale ma samayn karo.
I went to school here.	Waxaan aaday dugsiga halkan.
And you were alone.	Oo keligaa baad ahayd.
I was really surprised.	Runtii waan la yaabay.
Always.	Had iyo jeer.
I was lucky.	Nasiib ayaan lahaa.
He seemed to have no friends.	Waxa uu u muuqday in aanu lahayn wax saaxiibo ah.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
But only a few.	Laakiin kaliya mid yar.
He was not a bad person.	Ma ahayn qof xun.
It's just me.	Waa aniga oo kaliya.
That is the only thing they do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay sameeyaan.
It was great to see.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in la arko.
That did.	Taasi way samaysay.
There was still some difficulty.	Weli waxaa jiray xoogaa dhib ah.
Whatever you need, just let me know.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay, kaliya ii soo sheeg.
It was so small and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yar oo qurux badan.
I tried again.	Mar kale ayaan isku dayay.
He is much better than one.	Aad ayuu uga fiican yahay mid ka mid ah.
How are you.	Sidee tahay.
There was just nothing to do.	Ma jirin wax la sameeyo oo kaliya.
But that was one.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid.
It is really beautiful	Runtii waa qurux
The reason for this.	Sababta loo joogo.
You said he gave it to you.	Waxa aad sheegtay in uu ku siiyay.
It's busy, busy, busy today.	Waa mashquul, mashquul, mashquul maanta.
It's a bad thing.	Waa wax xun.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Where he was, something was true.	Meesha uu joogay, wax run ah ayaa ahaa.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
He has to do it.	Waa inuu sameeyaa.
No one else can do the job.	Qof kale ma qaban karo shaqada.
I really wanted to.	Runtii waan rabay.
It's bad.	Waa mid xun.
I have never seen him love her.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo jecel.
That is the job.	Taasi waa shaqada.
He had nothing to do here.	Ma jirin wax uu ku sameeyo halkan.
I looked well	si fiican ayaan u eegay
He should not say so.	Waa inuusan sidaas odhan.
Tell me now.	Hadda ii sheeg.
Lots of fun stuff.	Waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh.
He decided to leave.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu baxo.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
Him and me.	Isaga iyo aniga.
Maybe later, not tonight, but tomorrow.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in dambe, ma aha caawa, laakiin berri.
Take more.	Wax badan ka qaado.
It was clearly a big problem.	Waxay si cad u ahayd dhibaato weyn.
As you do.	Sida aad sameyso.
I had to work for it.	Waxay ahayd inaan u shaqeeyo.
Maybe that's what we don't understand.	Malaha taasi waa waxa aanu fahmin.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
I have never even been to one before.	Weligay xitaa hore uma aan tagin.
You may not understand.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan fahmin.
I have rich friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo lacag leh.
It is difficult to see how much money they will make.	Way adag tahay in la arko sida ay lacag badan u heli doonaan.
I felt it	waan dareemay
Obviously, they didn't tell me much about him.	Sida cad, wax badan igama ay sheegin isaga.
I can leave	Waan bixi karaa
I do not know what to tell you.	Ma garanayo waxaan kuu sheego.
All at once.	Dhammaan isku mar.
No one knows where you are.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha aad joogto.
One of us, now.	Mid naga mid ah, hadda.
I knew it would come.	Waan ogaa inay iman doonto.
I was there	waan joogay
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I hope this will help a lot.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay wax badan ka caawin doonto.
I did not like it.	Ma ka helin.
It will take a very long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
I hope so too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa sidoo kale.
No one can help me.	Qofna ima caawin karo.
Maybe I should.	Malaha waa inaan.
She had to be told.	Waxay ahayd in loo sheego.
It was an opportunity to do that.	Waxay ahayd fursad taas lagu sameeyo.
He is nothing but a friend.	Ma aha wax kale oo aan ahayn saaxiib.
She did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
I just wonder why that is.	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay sababta taas.
If he had, he would have done it earlier.	Haddii uu ahaan lahaa, hore ayuu u samayn lahaa.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
It can be anything.	Wuxuu noqon karaa wax kasta.
We are close here.	Waxaan ku dhow nahay halkan.
I wish it was me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay aniga ahaan lahayd.
That is so true.	Taasi waa sidaas run.
Please let everyone help me.	Fadlan qof kasta ha i caawiyo.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
He broke up.	Wuu kala tagay.
But he seems to like it.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu jecel yahay.
You can't leave.	Ma bixi kartid.
It will take a long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti dheer.
You can do what you like.	Waxaad samayn kartaa waxa aad jeceshahay.
But nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale maaha.
She would pay.	Way bixin lahayd.
But there is more, more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan, wax ka badan.
He should not.	Ma ahayn inuu.
He will surely succeed.	Waa hubaal inuu guulaysan doono.
Very good !.	Mid aad u fiican!.
But he wanted to.	Laakiin wuu rabay.
He knew he looked good.	Wuu ogaa in uu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I don't have to.	Ma aha inaan sameeyo.
That is what they are good at.	Taasi waa waxa ay ku fiican yihiin.
He must.	Waa inuu.
This was real.	Tani waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
That was what you said.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxaad tidhi.
It must be done correctly.	Waa in si sax ah loo sameeyaa.
I think it is for me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu aniga ii yahay.
I could not leave immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayaan meesha uga bixi waayay.
I lost	waan waayay
Do not take anything other than yourself.	Wax aan adiga ahayn ha qaadan.
They have to do everything for him.	Waa inay wax walba u sameeyaan isaga.
I still love you	wali waan ku jeclahay
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
He was ready for me.	Diyaar ayuu ii ahaa.
For me, that means a lot to me.	Aniga, taasi wax badan bay i leedahay.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
As you know.	Sida aad ogtahay.
It wasn’t even pretty.	Xitaa qurux ma ahayn.
I will give you another, in the same way.	Mid kale ayaan ku siin doonaa, si la mid ah.
I hope you like it !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay!.
It did not happen.	Way dhici wayday.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
No wonder why.	La yaab ma leh sababta.
But it was great.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid weyn.
what are you	maxaad tahay?.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha.
I knew nothing about this.	Waxba kama ogayn arrintan.
Again, he made it to leave work early.	Mar kale, wuxuu u sameeyay si uu shaqada uga baxo goor hore.
That sounds awful!	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid xun!
Then, i.	Ka dib, i.
I have no money now.	Hadda wax lacag ah ma haysto.
You are really a good friend.	Runtii waxaad tahay saaxiib wanaagsan.
Maybe I eat too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan aad u cuno.
Not just here, but everywhere.	Ma aha oo kaliya halkan, laakiin meel kasta.
No one was present.	Qofna meesha ma joogin.
I'm sorry, you say.	Waan ka xumahay, waxaad leedahay.
It's so great.	Waa sidaas weyn.
You may be seen.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in lagu arko.
I felt good.	Waxaan dareemay fiicnaan.
I would be a better person	Waxaan noqon lahaa qof ka wanaagsan
I am happy for you	waan kugu faraxsanahay
You look harmless.	Waxaad u egtahay mid aan dhib lahayn.
I got an idea.	Waxaan helay fikrad.
It is real.	Waa wax dhab ah.
There is no great urgency.	Ma jiro degdeg weyn.
Maybe he thought you were an old friend.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu u maleeyay inaad tahay saaxiib hore.
He told her he could not stay.	Wuxuu u sheegay inuusan joogi karin.
I don’t think anyone did.	U malayn maayo in qofna aanu samayn.
I know this is a bad time.	Waan ogahay in tani ay tahay waqti xun.
But maybe it was true.	Laakiin malaha run bay ahayd.
That we can go home.	In aan guriga aadi karno.
It is what we do.	Waa waxa aan samayno.
She did a beautiful thing for me.	Wax qurux badan bay ii samaysay.
No one knows where she is.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha ay joogto.
That is long.	Taasi waa dheer.
He is alive.	Waa nool.
I will come up with something else.	Wax kale ayaan ula iman doonaa isaga.
He said.	Wuxuu yidhi.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
That is enough, for the most part.	Taasi waa ku filan, inta badan.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
He lost what he had.	Wuxuu waayay wixii uu lahaa.
Absolutely.	Dhab ahaan.
He lost everything.	Wax walba wuu waayay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
But they love each other.	Laakiin way is jecel yihiin.
Why not.	Waa maxay sababta aadan u joogin.
I was really impressed	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay
Wouldn't it be a problem for you?	Miyaanay dhibaato kugu noqon.
There was something else at work, too.	Wax kale ayaa ka jiray shaqada, sidoo kale.
I have seen similar things.	Waxaan arkay waxyaabo la mid ah.
Maybe I should do another one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mid kale oo kale sameeyo.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
That was a little bit.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax yar.
I did what I was asked to do.	Waxaan sameeyay wixii la iga codsaday.
As I will do now.	Sida aan hadda yeeli doono.
I seemed to know him.	Waxaan u muuqday inaan garanayo isaga.
Now I got it.	Hadda waan helay.
I can't say enough good enough.	Wax ku filan oo wanaagsan kama odhan karo.
I looked everywhere.	Waxaan eegay meel kasta.
But no one else can do it.	Laakiin qof kale ma samayn karo.
It could happen tomorrow.	Waxay dhici kartaa berri.
But not anymore.	Laakiin mar dambe maaha.
Certainly not a good idea.	Dhab ahaantii fikrad wanaagsan maaha.
It can't hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli karto.
Good time indeed.	Waqti fiican runtii.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
I didn't get one.	Mid ma helin.
I will be there shortly.	Waxaan halkaas joogi doonaa wax yar ka dib.
There is.	Waxaa jira.
I'm glad you're here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto
It is beautiful.	Waa qurux.
He was amazed at what it looked like.	Waxa uu la yaabay sida ay u egtahay.
You will do this now.	Waxaad samayn doontaa tan hadda.
If you are not.	Haddii aadan ahayn.
I am very happy	aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
Someone would leave.	Qof baa bixi lahaa.
But no one wants it.	Laakiin qofna ma doonayo.
He loves this.	Waxa uu jecel yahay kan.
I was like, this is great.	Waxaan ahaa sida, tani aad bay u weyn tahay.
I am very happy now.	Hadda aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
She would stay there.	Way joogi lahayd halkaas.
I would not take it.	Ma qaadan lahaa.
But do nothing.	Laakiin waxba ha samayn.
He disappeared.	Wuu waayay.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
Everyone said the same thing, after all.	Qof kastaa wuxuu yidhi wax la mid ah, ka dib.
I rejected everything.	Wax walba waan diiday.
I want to come back and say something about him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan soo noqdo oo aan wax ka sheego isaga.
But this was not the only surprise.	Laakiin tani kaliya ma ahayn waxa la yaab leh oo dhacay.
He really wanted to be there.	Aad buu u rabay inuu halkaas joogo.
You just can’t get bad food.	Kaliya ma heli kartid cunto xun.
Nothing more.	Wax dambe ma jiro.
Great.	Si weyn.
He wants something he can't have.	Wuxuu rabaa wax uusan haysan karin.
I will not return	soo noqon maayo
I have not seen this.	Maan arag tan.
I picked up what they will need.	Waxaan soo qaatay waxay u baahan doonaan.
Isn't that very difficult.	Miyaanay ahayn mid aad u adag.
That would be a lie.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd been.
Not good.	Wax wanaagsan maaha.
I know it can do a lot.	Waan ogahay inay wax badan ka qaban karto.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
No one will ever have such an opportunity again.	Qofna mar dambe ma heli doono fursad sidaas oo kale ah.
I hope to see you soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan ku arko.
Very bad.	Aad u xun.
I was ready for it.	diyaar ayaan u ahaa.
Everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
But he needs you.	Laakiin wuu kuu baahan yahay.
He thought it was real.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inay dhab ka tahay.
I think this is a great lack.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in tani ay tahay la'aan weyn.
He went in here and now.	Wuu galay halkan iyo hadda.
I need it	waan u baahanahay
I am busy	Waxaan ahay mid mashquul ah
Very bad too.	Mid aad u xun sidoo kale.
Although it may have been so.	In kasta oo laga yaabo in ay sidaas oo kale ahayd.
That was a little while ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax yar ka hor.
This will not help people.	Tani dadka ma caawin doonto.
I knew he once did.	Waan ogaa in uu mar sameeyay.
That will be fine.	Taasi way fiicnaan doontaa.
You do not want to do this.	Ma rabto inaad tan samayso.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
You may not be able to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad awoodi weyday.
made me.	igu sameeyay.
But now he has decided to come out.	Laakiin hadda waxa uu go'aansaday in uu soo baxo.
He had to leave here.	Waxay ahayd inuu halkan ka baxo.
It is very large.	Aad buu u weyn yahay.
More will come soon	Wax badan ayaa iman doona dhawaan
I am a very good person.	Waxaan ahay qof aad u fiican.
We would do the same.	Waxaan sameyn lahayn sidaas oo kale.
You should have lied to me.	Waxay ahayd inaad been ii sheegto.
Everyone is very excited about this.	Qof kastaa aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay arrintan.
It is the best.	Waa tan ugu fiican.
I have a strange problem.	Waxaan qabaa dhibaato yaab leh.
That it was time.	In ay ahayd waqti.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
There is still more to come.	Weli wax badan ayaa iman lahaa.
I hope that is not you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi aysan ahayn adiga.
I got to help	Waxaan helay inaan caawiyo
It is still here.	Wali waa halkan.
I looked at everything.	Wax walba waan eegay.
After all, it wasn’t long ago.	Ka dib oo dhan, ma aysan ahayn waqti dheer ka hor.
He said for sure.	Wuxuu yidhi hubaal.
I hope you will get better soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad si degdeg ah u fiicnaan doonto.
I know something.	Wax baan garanayaa.
He looked back.	Dib ayuu u eegay.
But that everything is nothing.	Laakiin in wax walba aysan waxba ahayn.
There is nothing else in it.	Wax kale oo ku jira ma jiraan.
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
Seriously, really bad.	Dhab ah, dhab ah oo xun.
You may not understand this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan fahmin tan.
The more you do, the better you will get.	Inta badan oo aad sameyso, si fiican ayaad u heli doontaa.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
He is someone else.	Waa qof kale.
I thought we were.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan nahay.
We are still good friends.	Wali waxaan nahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
I can not do it	Ma samayn karo
Nothing to see here.	Wax halkan lagu arko ma jiraan.
I made money	Lacag baan sameeyay
It has just started.	Waa la bilaabay hadda.
What to do?	Maxaa la sameeyaa?
It was not very interesting.	Ma ahayn mid aad u xiiso badan.
I will stay here.	Halkan ayaan joogi doonaa.
Good, but the same.	Wanaagsan, laakiin isku mid.
I left	waan baxay
I think no one can.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in qofna ma awoodo.
This was new.	Tani waxay ahayd mid cusub.
This cannot be done better.	Tan si ka wanaagsan ma loo samayn karaa.
Do you know that you are a person.	Ma ogtahay inaad tahay qof.
No one found it.	Cidna ma uu helin.
He seems to like it.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu jecel yahay.
He will be ready to go.	Wuxuu diyaar u noqon doonaa inuu tago.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
Enough yet he did not say.	In ku filan weli ma uu odhan.
He refused several times.	Dhowr jeer buu diiday.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
There was little to show for it.	Wax yar baa ka muuqday.
But he has not come here yet.	Laakiin halkan weli ma iman.
I hope he does.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameeyo.
He could not have imagined anything better.	Wax ka wanaagsan ma uu malayn karin.
I think he has.	Waxaan filayaa inuu leeyahay.
I don't understand why you would do that.	Ma fahmin sababta aad sidaas u samayn lahayd.
I doubt it will actually leave.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in ay dhab ahaantii ka tagi doonto.
I am not very sure of that and.	Aad uma hubo taas iyo.
You need someone.	Waxaad u baahan tahay qof .
But he did not want to.	Laakiin ma uu doonayn.
You just have to.	Kaliya waa inaad.
I wish I didn't know	Waxaan jeclahay inaanan garanayn
I will not be there	Ma joogi doono halkaas
This is the only one.	Tani waa ka kaliya.
We need more of that.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo taas ah.
That is today.	Taas oo ay maanta tahay.
I was surprised.	waan kula yaabay.
But that is a good idea.	Laakiin taasi waa fikrad wanaagsan.
It doesn't look bad.	Uma eka mid xun.
I did not want to leave.	Maan rabin inaan baxo.
He will stay somewhere.	Meel buu joogi doonaa.
Ah, here it is.	Ah, waa kan.
How do you think this should be done?	Sidee kula tahay in tan la sameeyo?.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba uma sheegin.
I just did not go.	Kaliya ma tagin.
You lied about that.	Taas ayaad been ka sheegtay.
No other problems were found	Dhib kale lama helin
It looks beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay qurux.
It is still there.	Wali waa halkaas.
Hard time.	Waqti adag.
This is not very interesting.	Tani ma aha mid aad u xiiso badan.
I didn't want to go.	Ma rabin inaan tago.
You will not believe me.	Ima rumaysan doonto.
I know that for sure.	Waan ogahay taas hubaal.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
He looked at me in surprise.	Si yaab leh ayuu ii eegay.
I am a good friend.	Waxaan ahay saaxiib wanaagsan.
Very beautiful for sure.	Aad u qurux badan waa hubaal.
It doesn't matter to me.	Waxba igama aha.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
I just expect it to be done.	Kaliya waxaan filayaa in la sameeyo.
I do not know if we can win.	Ma garanayo in aan guulaysan karno.
You can now stop	Hadda waad joojin kartaa
You can't help but be happy with that.	Ma caawin kartid, laakiin waxaad ku faraxsan tahay taas.
Whatever she would do.	Wax kasta oo ay samayn lahayd.
Tell them what happened.	U sheeg waxa dhacay.
If so, please let me know.	Haddii ay jirto, fadlan ii soo sheeg.
Doing what you want.	Samaynta waxaad rabto.
I can hardly believe it.	Si dhib ah uma rumaysan karo.
Good	Wanaagsan
Not just him.	Kaliya maaha isaga.
Why didn't anyone help us?	Maxaa qofna noo caawin waayay?
Time has done so.	Waqti ayaa sidaas sameeyay.
He saw what was best for the people.	Waxa uu arkay waxa ugu wanaagsan dadka.
Ah! 	Ah!
It was not.	Ma aysan ahayn.
I will not do so.	Anigu sidaas yeeli maayo.
He would see what it looked like.	Wuxuu arki lahaa sida ay u egtahay.
It was a good thing.	Waxay ahayd wax fiican.
I'm happy to have it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan haysto.
Great thing, really.	Wax weyn, dhab ahaantii.
She has many friends.	Waxay leedahay saaxiibo badan.
I got that.	Waan helay taas.
But not so long ago.	Laakiin waqti dheer ka hor wax badan ma ahayn.
And don't do this again.	Oo mar dambe tan ha samayn.
I'm glad to have you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku haysto.
Very well, really.	Si aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
This really can't be done.	Tani dhab ahaantii lama samayn karo.
I am so good.	Waxaan ahay sidaas si fiican.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
In fact, sometimes it is one man.	Dhab ahaantii, mar mar waa hal nin.
Out of it.	Ka soo baxay.
We can't stay here.	Halkan kuma joogi karno.
They will do what they think is right.	Waxay samayn doonaan waxay la tahay waa sax.
And take one day.	Oo hal maalin qaado.
I didn't find anything.	Waxba maan helin.
Lots of money too.	Lacag aad u badan sidoo kale.
Things that will get us.	Waxyaabo naga heli doona.
He has been with us for over a year now.	In ka badan hal sano ayuu nala joogaa hadda.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
And someone else is in the room.	Oo qof kale ayaa qolka ku jira.
I picked it up quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaan u soo qaaday.
It may take some time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa xoogaa waqti ah.
It remains to be seen whether this will happen.	Waa la arki doonaa in taasi dhici doonto iyo in kale.
It was taken.	Waa loo qaatay.
I just know it is beautiful here.	Kaliya waan ogahay inay qurux badan tahay halkan.
He had the following.	Wuu lahaa soo socda.
That's it.	Waa taas.
You	Adiga
I knew you needed me.	Waan ogaa inaad ii baahan tahay.
Lots of amazing friends.	Saaxiibo badan oo yaab leh.
I was having a great time.	Waxaan ahaa waqti weyn.
Bad stuff there.	Waxyaabo ku xun halkaas.
I think it is really good for everyone.	Waxaan filayaa inay runtii u fiican tahay qof kasta.
That is a big problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato weyn.
And it wasn't really that good.	Oo waxa uusan ahayn mid aad u fiican runtii.
If you are really serious.	Haddii aad dhab ahaantii dhab tahay.
But no one will.	Laakiin qof ma yeeli doono.
And you already have one.	Oo waxaad hore u leedahay mid.
Certainly not tonight.	Hubaal caawa maaha.
I saw what he could do.	Waxaan arkay waxa uu samayn karo.
We will definitely see.	Waa hubaal waan arki doonaa.
No one saw it.	Qofna arag.
I am very happy to be here with you.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan kula joogo.
It is a very, very big place.	Waa meel aad iyo aad uga weyn tan.
And a little.	Iyo in yar .
I guess he doesn't want to tell me.	Waxaan filayaa inuusan rabin inuu ii sheego.
Tom was not present in person.	Tom ma uusan joogin qof ahaan.
You know it's true.	Waad ogtahay inay run tahay.
It's even smaller.	Xitaa way ka yar tahay.
They love that.	Way jecel yihiin taas.
It was a terrible place.	Waxay ahayd meel aad u xun.
It may take a while.	Waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti yar.
There was not much, but there was something.	Wax badan kuma jirin, laakiin wax baa jiray.
Like three times.	Sida saddex jeer.
At first he knew surprises.	Markii hore yaab buu yaqaan.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
He seemed real.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid dhab ah.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I don't think he can make much money from it.	U malayn maayo inuu lacag badan ka samayn karo sidaas.
I don't know how to tell you what happened.	Ma garanayo si aan kuu sheego waxa dhacay.
Give and take.	Wax bixi oo qaado.
No one is here.	Qofna halkan ma joogo.
I was hit by a car.	Baabuur baa igu soo dhacay.
I may leave at any time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan baxo wakhti kasta.
It is there, even so.	Waa halkaas, xitaa sidaas.
What she would say.	Waxa ay odhan lahayd.
I think it is hard enough.	Waxaan filayaa inuu dhib ku filan yahay.
I would do nothing for it.	Waxba waan u samayn lahaa.
Nothing will happen.	Wax dhici doona ma jiraan.
Maybe he is the only one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu yahay ka kaliya.
This was not a coincidence.	Tani ma ahayn wax iska dhacay.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
Something else went wrong.	Wax kale ayaa meesha ka baxay.
And now here.	Oo hadda halkan.
That is to say.	Taas oo la odhan karo.
How to make it fun.	Sida loo sameeyo mid xiiso leh.
Like, all.	Sida, oo dhan.
I didn't want to be here.	Maan rabin inaan halkaan joogo.
I will have time for this.	Tani waqti ayaan u heli doonaa.
I was like that.	Waxaan la mid ahaa.
No one wants that !.	Qofna taas ma rabo!.
Yes.	Waa.
I hope you like it.	Aan rajaynayo inaad jeceshahay.
No one knew.	Qofna ma ogayn.
But he had no idea why this was so.	Laakiin ma uusan lahayn fikrad ah sababta ay tani sidaas u tahay.
But now he has begun.	Laakiin hadda wuu bilaabay.
You are too much otherwise.	Aad baad u badan tahay haddii kale.
He may have been there once.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu hal mar joogay.
There was bad, too.	Waxaa jiray xun, sidoo kale.
I did not have a single friend.	Hal saaxiib maan lahayn.
It looks so well done.	Waxay u egtahay mid si fiican loo sameeyay.
I do that a lot.	Aad ayaan u sameeyaa taas.
For the most part, that’s a big deal.	Inta badan, taasi waa wax weyn.
But that will not help.	Laakiin taasi ma caawin doonto.
Maybe he knew.	Malaha wuu ogaa.
A great friend.	Saaxiib waa weyn yahay.
Everyone was there.	Qof kasta oo qof ahaa ayaa halkaas joogay.
Otherwise I will get nothing.	Haddii kale waxba ma heli doono.
He will be back tonight, he said.	Caawa ayuu soo noqon doonaa, ayuu yidhi.
He wants to do something.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu wax sameeyo.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
And I could not see anything.	Oo waxba ma arki karin.
I don't feel it.	Ma dareemayo.
I hope to find out.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ogaado.
What happened happened.	Wixii dhacay waa dhacay.
But so it is.	Laakiin sidaas oo ay tahay.
That is how it is here.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay halkan.
I do not share this.	Ma rabo kan.
There is no one like him.	Qof la mid ah ma jiro.
To tell them everything.	Si aad wax walba ugu sheegto.
And he could not see.	Oo wuu arki waayay.
But when you say you are like him.	Laakiin markii aad sheegtay in aad isaga la mid tahay.
I have tried it several times before.	Waxaan isku dayay dhowr kaa hor.
What a problem.	Maxaa dhib ah.
This was so beautiful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
I'm sure there are several.	Waxaan hubaa inay tahay inay jiraan dhowr.
I am happy to be at home	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan guriga joogo
Good food, for sure.	Cunto wanaagsan, hubaal.
It was a clear white day.	Waxay ahayd maalin cad oo cad.
That is what he is doing now.	Waa waxa uu hadda sameeyo.
I don't have to do anything.	Ma aha inaan wax sameeyo.
I don't even think he loves you.	Xitaa uma maleynayo inuu ku jecel yahay.
I will talk to you shortly.	Wax yar ka dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa.
For me, this is a good opportunity.	Aniga ahaan, tani waa fursad wanaagsan.
He was.	Waxa uu ahaa.
It would be a problem.	Dhib bay ahaan lahayd.
She said so.	Waxay tidhi sidaas.
It certainly did not work out.	Waxa hubaal ah in aanay waxba ka soo bixin.
That you have.	In aad leedahay.
That was done.	Taasi waa la sameeyay.
Good idea.	Fikrad wanaagsan.
That would be interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale .
It only contains a purchase.	Kaliya waxa ku jira in la iibsado.
Probably nothing to say.	Malaha waxba lama odhan lahaa.
What he wanted and why.	Waxa uu ka rabay iyo sababta.
There is something strange here.	Waxaa jira wax yaab leh halkan.
She said she was busy.	Waxay sheegtay inay mashquul tahay.
It was one year older.	Waxay ahayd hal sano ka weyn.
Everyone is fine.	Qof walba wuu fiican yahay.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
he was not ready	diyaar uma ahayn
He is fine now.	Hadda wuu fiican yahay.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo.
Only, you know.	Oo kaliya, waad ogtahay.
After all, it was very small.	Ka dib oo dhan, waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
I'm afraid you can't come back.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaadan soo noqon karin.
She has a job.	Waxay leedahay shaqo.
Every moment will come now.	Waqti kasta hadda way iman doontaa.
No one has come yet.	Weli cidna ma iman.
I told him no.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay jirin.
Otherwise, it is not.	Haddii kale, ma aha.
There was a little surprise.	Waxaa jiray wax yar oo yaab leh.
Someone has to say something.	Waa in qof wax sheego.
That sounds weird.	Taasi waxay u egtahay wax la yaab leh.
I'm just sorry for you.	Kaliya waan kaa xumahay.
Maybe they are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay yihiin.
This is nothing new there.	Tani maaha wax ku cusub halkaas.
But it will not always be.	Laakiin mar walba ma ahaan doonto.
It was to work together.	Waxay ahayd in la wada shaqeeyo.
They just don’t.	Kaliya ma sameeyaan.
I know this is true.	Waxaan ogahay inay tani run tahay.
He went out to help.	Wuxuu u baxay inuu caawiyo.
He said firmly.	Si adag ayuu u yidhi.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
But it has everything.	Laakiin wax walba ayaa leh.
You need to know this.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad tan ogaato.
There is nothing so beautiful.	Wax aad u qurux badan ma jiraan.
And it really does not matter.	Oo runtii dhib ma leh.
Now that is untrue.	Hadda taasi waa wax aan run ahayn.
"I am happy," he said.	Waan ku faraxsanahay ayuu yiri.
She loves it.	Aad bay u jeceshahay.
Something new and new.	Wax cusub oo cusub.
She can't do anything right now.	Hadda waxba ma qaban karto.
I knew how to do it.	Waan ogaa sida loo sameeyo.
It is as if they had nothing to do with him.	Waxay la mid tahay in aanay isaga waxba ka doonayn.
In fact, he did not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma uusan lahayn.
I love it, really.	Waan jeclahay, run ahaantii.
I want you to be here.	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan joogto.
He knows a lot.	Wax badan ayuu garanayaa.
I need one	Waxaan u baahanahay mid
It was a terrible problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato aad u xun.
But there is.	Laakiin waxaa jira.
One was very beautiful.	Mid ka mid ah wuxuu ahaa mid aad u qurux badan.
But it is not food.	Laakiin maaha cunto.
A new idea for me.	Fikrad cusub aniga.
It can be a very bad day today.	Waxay noqon kartaa maalin aad u xun maanta.
He, too, had things to do.	Isaga, sidoo kale, wuxuu lahaa waxyaabo uu sameeyo.
And got it.	Oo ka helay.
That was for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd hubaal.
No problem, he said.	Dhib malaha, ayuu yidhi.
I should not have left you.	Ma ahayn inaan kaa tago.
It was each.	Waxay ahayd mid kasta.
I have food.	Ma cunto.
He did not stay longer.	In ka badan ma uu sii joogin.
I want to see	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko
I am very happy now.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay hadda.
And for the most part, it is.	Iyo inta badan, waa.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
She really did.	Dhab ahaantii way samaysay.
That's how it feels to me.	Taasi waa sida ay aniga ila tahay.
This is another great one.	Tani waa mid kale oo weyn.
You don't want to tell me, you don't need to tell me.	Ma rabto inaad ii sheegto, uma baahnid inaad ii sheegto.
She really had.	Runtii way lahayd.
I think he can do it.	Waxaan filayaa inuu samayn karo.
So much space available.	Meel aad u badan ayaa diyaar ah.
I was busy	mashquul baan ahaa
It can happen anywhere.	Waxay ka dhici kartaa meel kasta.
It's great.	Waa weyn yahay.
Good.	Fiican.
No matter what it is.	Dhib malaha waxa uu yahay.
He can do it with people, too.	Waxa uu la samayn karaa dadka, sidoo kale.
I'm just glad I came out.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ka soo baxay.
What is needed.	Maxaa loo baahan yahay.
I know he won't.	Waan ogahay inuusan yeeli doonin.
I really didn't like that.	Runtii sidaas uma jeclayn.
I would love that	Waan jeclaan lahaa taas
As if.	Sida haddii.
You need to help people.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad dadka caawiso.
I know very well what we are.	Waxaan si fiican u garanayaa waxa aan nahay.
It is very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
This should also be done.	Tani waa in sidoo kale la sameeyaa.
Just not very happy.	Kaliya maaha mid aad u faraxsan.
It is a very interesting idea.	Waa fikrad aad u xiiso badan.
This is true today as never before.	Tani waa run maanta si aan hore loo arag.
It really looks interesting.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay mid xiiso leh.
I do not have to know anything else.	Ma aha in aan wax kale ogaado.
We will help you there	Halkaas ayaan ku caawin doonaa
I still do not know why.	Ilaa hadda ma garanayo sababta.
They really are.	Waxay dhab ahaantii yihiin.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
It was stuff.	Waxay ahayd waxyaabo.
You did not find anything	Wax baad ka heli wayday
Not sure what that is, really.	Ma hubo waxa taasi tahay, dhab ahaan.
He has to learn a lot.	Waa inuu wax badan barto.
And you will be more.	Oo waxaad noqon doontaa wax badan.
He may have said a lot.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu wax badan yidhi.
He is doing a good job.	Shaqo fiican buu hayaa.
Not that it will do much good.	Ma aha in ay wax badan oo wanaagsan samayn doonto.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
I will stay here again	Mar kale ayaan sii joogi doonaa halkan
That is more than any man needs.	Taasi waa wax ka badan nin kastaa u baahan yahay.
No one could do anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn karin.
I will not do it, but they will assume I will do it.	Ma yeeli doono, laakiin waxay u qaadan doonaan inaan sameyn doono.
It is always the same.	Mar walba waa isku mid.
A little, really.	In yar, dhab ahaantii.
She really looks like a good, good, person.	Runtii waxay u egtahay qof wanaagsan, wanaagsan, qof.
Enough for three people.	Ku filan saddex qof.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
Take time off from work.	Waqti ka qaado shaqada.
It should.	Waa in.
Everything is correct.	Wax walba waa sax.
I know what he wants.	Waan ogahay waxa uu rabo.
And not many of us.	Oo ma jiraan in badan oo naga mid ah.
I think they will love it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jeclaan doonaan.
The best.	Waxa ugu wanaagsan.
You are better than me.	Waad iga fiican tahay aniga.
No matter how.	Dhib malaha sida.
He told a clear lie.	Been cad buu sheegay.
Even before.	Xitaa ka hor.
It can't be him.	Ma noqon karto isaga.
Not the old, not the new.	Ma aha kii hore, ma aha kan cusub.
This is, perhaps, obvious.	Tani waa, laga yaabaa, cad.
Can anyone help please?	Qofna ma caawin karaa fadlan?.
Not so clearly.	Ma aha si cad.
To do what?	Si loo sameeyo maxaa?
Just a few.	Kaliya dhowr.
What is real, remains to be seen.	Maxaa dhab ah, ayaa weli ah in la arko.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad u qurux badan tahay.
It was really amazing.	Runtii waxay ahayd yaab.
do not waste time.	waqti ha ka bixin.
Maybe he is right.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu sax yahay.
I do not go to school.	Anigu ma aado dugsiga.
They are more than us.	Way naga badan yihiin.
I started talking.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan hadlo.
This is not true.	Tani run ma aha.
That is more than enough.	Taasi waa wax ka badan oo ku filan.
I saw it everywhere.	Waxaan ku arkay meel walba.
I am just something.	Kaliya wax aan ahay.
Not that I don't like you.	Ma ahan inaan ku jeclayn.
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
That is not true	Taasi run maaha
It takes a lot of intelligence to do this.	Waxay u baahan tahay caqli badan si tan loo sameeyo.
Maybe not a good idea.	Malaha fikrad fiican maaha.
I knew it would come out.	Waan ogaa inay soo bixi doonto.
A little closer.	In yar oo dhow.
You are probably the same.	Waxay u badan tahay inaad isku mid tahay.
He came a little late.	In yar buu u yimid.
But they need money.	Laakiin waxay u baahan yihiin lacag.
Today is a great day.	Maanta waa maalin weyn.
He seemed very small.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u yar.
We are old friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo hore.
I got one.	Waxaan helay mid ka mid ah.
He is the same person.	Waa isku qof.
The French told us.	Faransiis baa noo sheegay.
I do not have time to do this now.	Waqti uma hayo inaan tan ku sameeyo hadda.
This is probably what you want.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaad rabto.
But it really isn’t.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii maaha.
No one knew much.	Qofna wax badan kama ogayn.
I was	waxaan ahaa
Out together.	Wada baxay.
I will do whatever I can to help, whatever.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa wax kasta oo aan ku caawiyo, wax kasta.
After a while	Muddo yar ka dib
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
You can talk to him.	Waad la hadli kartaa isaga.
It is not too hard to find him.	Ma aha inay aad u adag tahay in la helo isaga.
I don't think you told me everything he said.	U malayn maayo inaad ii sheegtay wax walba oo uu yidhi.
He would stay.	Wuu joogi lahaa.
It's hard to find.	Way adag tahay in la helo.
That would be for each of us.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
As if one would help.	Sida haddii mid ka mid ah uu caawin doono.
Let me be.	Aan noqdo.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
All is well now.	Dhammaan hadda waa wanaagsan yihiin.
I thought it was really good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii fiican tahay.
It is very small, and so, very beautiful.	Aad bay u yar tahay, iyo si, aad u qurux badan.
The cause is still unknown.	Sababta ilaa hadda lama garanayo.
Not sure what to do with that.	Ma hubo waxa aan ka sameeyo taas.
I will need a clear cut.	Waxaan u baahan doonaa cad cad.
Nothing came of it.	Wax soo baxay ma jiraan.
I pretended not to understand.	Waxaan iska dhigay inaanan fahmin.
Really good and real man.	Runtii nin wanaagsan oo dhab ah.

It will definitely get better.	Runtii wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
I do not have	Maan haysan
I would like to help you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku caawiyo.
In fact, it was great.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
I would not like much.	Wax badan ma jeclaan lahaa.
I hope it will be already.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay mar hore noqon doonto.
This was a great opportunity for me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd fursad weyn.
That was as it was.	Taasi waxay ahayd sidii ay ahayd.
Not really one of us did.	Run ahaantii mid naga mid ah ma samayn.
Maybe she will even like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xitaa jeclaan doonto.
And they really do.	Oo runtii way sameeyaan.
I can do it if you want.	Waan samayn karaa haddii aad rabto.
It was a good place to come from.	Waxay ahayd meel wanaagsan oo laga iman karo.

If he still had.	Haddii uu weli lahaa.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.

I was lucky.	Nasiib ayaan lahaa.
It would be better now.	Hadda way fiicnaan lahayd.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
I did not like that.	Maan jeclayn taas.
You know that now.	Waad ogtahay taas hadda.
He was all other men.	Wuxuu ahaa nin kale oo dhan.
He said a lot.	Wax badan buu yidhi.
I don't want that anymore.	Taas mar dambe ma rabo.
He was a little.	Wuxuu ahaa wax yar.
I have to do something.	Waa inaan wax sameeyaa.
All the same.	Dhammaan isku mid.
Now it is one.	Hadda waa mid.
I know a good place.	Meel fiican ayaan garanayaa.
I did not know.	Maan garanayn.
Today, there are none.	Maanta, ma jiraan.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
You will soon see everyone.	Waxaad dhawaan arki doontaa qof kasta.
He did not know that this would be something he needed to do.	Ma uu ogayn in tani ay noqon doonto wax uu u baahan yahay inuu sameeyo.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
Any time.	Waqti kasta.
Everyone had the same opportunity.	Qof kastaa wuxuu helay fursad isku mid ah .

I knew it well.	Si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
I hope you have a beautiful day.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad leedahay maalin qurux badan.
This was a great opportunity.	Tani waxay ahayd fursad weyn.
Tomorrow, of course, tomorrow.	Berri, hubaal, berri.
I was one of them.	Waxaan ka mid ahaa.
What was that? 	Maxay ahayd taasi?
There was nowhere to leave here.	Ma jirin meel laga tago halkan.
Who knew he had one.	Yaa ogaa inuu mid lahaa.
It may have another day.	Waxay haysan kartaa maalin kale.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Someone like you.	Qof kula mid ah.
You weren’t with him, that was the biggest thing.	Ma aadan la joogin isaga, taasi waxay ahayd waxa ugu weyn.
We will do everything for you if you want.	Wax walba waan kuu qaban doonaa haddii aad rabto.
I looked back	Dib ayaan eegay

He says so.	Waxa uu leeyahay waa sidaas.
I know it was.	Waan ogahay inay ahayd.
But no one.	Laakiin qofna ma jiro.

I am him.	aniga ayaa ah isaga.
Spend time however you want.	Waqti ku bixi si kasta oo aad rabto.
Why is it.	Waa maxay sababta ay tahay.
But, really, we can’t say what we will do.	Laakiin, runtii, ma sheegi karno waxaan samayn doono.
Is that true.	Ma taasi runtii.
It is not time to talk about this now.	Ma aha markii laga hadli lahaa arrintan hadda.
But what happened happened.	Laakiin maxaa dhacay waa dhacay.
A smart man.	Nin caqli badan.
I know how it works.	Waan ogahay sida uu u shaqeeyo.
It can take several years.	Waxay qaadan kartaa dhowr sano.
It is you.	Adiga ayaa ah.
You can do that.	Waad samayn kartaa taas.
I really can't say.	Runtii ma sheegi karo.
Best done the day before.	Sida ugu fiican ee la sameeyo maalin ka hor.
I started to find myself.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan is helo.
No one else will.	Qof kale ma yeeli doono.
He was right.	Run buu sheegay.
They have to do that.	Waa inay sidaas sameeyaan.
You are there for me.	Adiga ayaa ii jira.
This was not the time to come back.	Tani ma ahayn wakhti dib loo soo noqon lahaa.
I have to know.	Waa inaan ogaado.
It is a beautiful day.	Waa maalin qurux badan.

It is indeed a beautiful time.	Runtii waa wakhti qurux badan.
Tell me why.	Sababta ii sheeg.
Someone else got it.	Qof kale ayaa helay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
Not bad.	Si xun.
This is now.	Tani waa hadda.
And beautiful that.	Iyo mid qurux badan taas.
This is really bad.	Tani run ahaantii waa wax xun.

Give it again.	Mar kale sii.
We were not.	Waxaan ahayn.

This, too, is a lie.	Tani, sidoo kale, waa been.
We need to work on it now.	Waxaan u baahanahay in laga shaqeeyo hadda.
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
But nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale ma jiraan.
He is who he is.	Waa qofka uu yahay.
I'm afraid there is only one.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inuu jiro mid kaliya.
It was and is all there.	Way ahayd oo waa halkaas oo dhan.
I saw something else.	Wax kale ayaan arkay.
Everything else he left behind.	Wax kasta oo kale oo uu ka tagay.
He always did what he thought was best for me.	Had iyo jeer wuxuu samayn jiray waxa uu u malaynayo inay aniga ii fiican tahay.
But she could not see anything.	Laakiin waxba ma ay arki karin.
One every day.	Hal maalin kasta.
As he had the place.	Sidii uu meesha u lahaa.
This was not true now.	Tani run ma ahayn hadda.
I will talk to you soon	waan kula hadli doonaa dhawaan
That would also be a lie.	Taasi waxay sidoo kale noqon lahayd been.

He is a very smart man.	Waa nin aad u caqli badan.
This is free.	Tani waa lacag la'aan.
Before it was.	Ka hor waxay ahayd .
He looked at it without hesitation.	Si aan dhib lahayn ayuu u eegay.
And I need another one.	Oo mid kale ayaan u baahanahay.
But now he is fine.	Laakiin hadda wuu ku fiican yahay.
He is there.	Wuu joogaa.
If he has no money, he cannot pay.	Haddii uusan lacag haysan, waxba ma bixin karo.
It is also very difficult to do.	Waxa kale oo aad u adag in la sameeyo.
I knew how.	Waan ogaa sida.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
Here is a better one.	Waa kan mid ka wanaagsan.
He was a bad man.	Nin xun buu ahaa.
I think that is enough.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ku filan tahay.
I think they shouldn’t.	Waxaan filayaa inaysan ahayn inay sameeyaan.
I do not want to talk about him.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo isaga.
Nothing else happened.	Wax kale oo dhacay ma jirto.
It doesn’t have to be a big deal.	Ma aha inuu noqdo wax weyn.
And here.	Oo halkan.

Please see	Fadlan arag
I did not stop.	Maan joojin.
I did not like to see much.	Maan jeclayn inaan wax badan arko.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
You can do better than that.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka wanaagsan taas.
I'm sure they have no idea what they are doing.	Waxaan hubaa inaysan wax fikrad ah ka lahayn waxay sameeyaan.
Wherever they are the smartest.	Meel kasta oo ay ugu caqli badan yihiin.
It was very small.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
He was a little surprised.	Waxa uu ahaa yaab yar.
He may not need to be here for this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan u baahnayn inuu halkan u joogo tan.
I didn't think so, he said.	Uma malaynayn, ayuu yidhi.
There is so much you can do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo aad sameyn karto.

She told us she didn't know anything.	Waxay noo sheegtay in aanay waxba garanayn.
I'm leaving now.	hadda waan tagi.
So to speak.	Sidaas in la hadlo.
You don't need much.	Wax badan uma baahnid.
I wish it could be found everywhere.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in meel walba laga heli karo.
More than happy.	In ka badan faraxsan.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan hadda tago.
All they need is food.	Waxa kaliya ee ay u baahan yihiin waa cunto.
Take me now.	Hadda i qaado.
She refused.	Way diiday.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
Let me see you again.	Aan mar kale arko.
I'm really sorry about this.	Runtii waan ka xumahay tan.
I heard you have something.	Waxaan maqlay inaad wax leedahay.

Sometimes I will need money.	Mar waxaan u baahan doonaa lacag.
He really felt they were right.	Runtii wuu dareemay inay run yihiin.
Out	Ka baxay
Can you help.	Ma caawin kartaa.

That is what he knew.	Taasi waa waxa uu ogaa.
You have done better.	Wax ka fiican baad samaysay.
If you have one, you are lucky.	Haddii aad mid leedahay, waxaad tahay nasiib.
I was very ready.	Aad ayaan diyaar u ahaa.
We would break up.	Waanu kala tagi lahayn.
He did not succeed in that.	Taas kuma uu guulaysan.
I need	waxaan u baahanahay
It was a good time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti fiican.
He knew that for sure.	Wuu ogaa taas hubaal.
He looked bigger.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid ka weyn.
This is not always the case.	Had iyo jeer sidaas maaha.
you were not present	ma aadan joogin
Not a very good friend, but a friend.	Ma aha saaxiib aad u fiican, laakiin saaxiib.
Maybe I am.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ahay.
He is with us.	Waa nala joogaa.
Everything takes time.	Wax walba waxay u baahan yihiin waqti.
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u wanaagsan.
Which is worse.	Taas oo uu ka xun yahay.
I would stay there again.	Mar kale ayaan sii joogi lahaa halkaas.
As if he would need more.	Sida haddii uu u baahan lahaa wax ka badan.
I do not know anything else.	Ma garanayo wax kale.
Like a few, really.	Sida dhowr, dhab ahaantii.
I can't talk about that.	Taas kama hadli karo.
.	.
I can't believe it's really me.	Ma rumaysan karo inay dhab ahaantii aniga tahay.

I will talk about one.	Mid baan ka hadli doonaa.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
This is obvious.	Tani waa sida iska cad.
But it is good.	Laakiin waa mid wanaagsan.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
She said she did not know why.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay garanayn sababta.
I can't say she has.	Ma odhan karo way leedahay.
It can really be awful.	Runtii waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xun.
That was before.	Taasi waxay ahayd ka hor.
That can be difficult.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
When he returned, he told them everything.	Markii uu soo noqday ayuu wax walba u sheegay.
I recently became one.	Waxaan dhawaan noqday mid.
I'm not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta taasi tahay.
It would do little harm.	Wax dhib yar bay yeeli lahayd.
Not true.	Run maaha.
There was no one else.	Meesha qof kale ma jirin.
And not just me.	Oo aniga kaliya maaha.
It's an interesting idea.	Waa fikrad xiiso leh.
It will always be.	Had iyo jeer way ahaan doontaa.
I think that includes us.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi nagu jirto.

I did, too, first.	Waxaan sameeyay, sidoo kale, marka hore.
Money, money, money!	Lacag, lacag, lacag!
And it had to be done quickly.	Oo waxay ahayd in si degdeg ah loo sameeyo.
He loves it very much.	Aad ayuu u jecel yahay.
That is a real problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato dhab ah.
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
It is still.	Waa weli.
No one did that.	Qofna taas ma samayn.
It was too early yet.	Waxay ahayd goor hore weli.
Everyone thought it was great.	Qof kastaa wuxuu mooday inay aad u wanaagsan tahay.
One, obviously, was time.	Mid, sida cad, wuxuu ahaa waqti.
Too much time is gone.	Waqti aad u badan ayaa tagay.
It was not an opportunity.	Fursad ma ahayn.
It wasn’t hard enough.	Ma ahayn mid adag oo ku filan.

He started.	Wuu bilaabay.
This is nothing.	Tani waxba maaha.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.

That being said.	Sidaas ayaa la yiri.
She promised it would be.	Waxay ballan qaaday in ay noqon doonto.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I had to leave.	Waxay ahayd inaan baxo.
I didn't say much.	Wax badan ma odhan.
That was tough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
You weren't ready for that.	Taas diyaar uma aadan ahayn.
I really don’t like to do it.	Runtii ma jecli inaan sameeyo.
I think it's a good idea.	Waxay ila tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
We still have to do that.	Weli waa in aan sidaas samayno.
I don't know, really.	Ma garanayo, run ahaantii.
Can you be better	Ma ka sii fiicnaan kartaa

I need money	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag
I don't think it's that hard.	Uma maleynayo inay sidaas u adag tahay.
Great surprise.	Yaab weyn.
Not everyone has time.	Qof walba waqti uma hayo.
We are ready when you are.	Waxaan diyaar u nahay marka aad tahay.

I would do it again.	Mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa.
No one was home.	Qofna guriga ma joogin.

It is not just a beautiful thing to learn.	Kaliya maaha wax qurux badan in la barto.
She refused something else.	Wax kale way diiday.
Someone would come.	Qof baa iman lahaa.
And another.	Iyo mid kale.
Friend and friend.	Saaxiib iyo saaxiib.
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
But it is a bit difficult.	Laakiin way yara adag tahay.
There is so much to do!	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo!
It was not right.	Wax sax ah kuma ahayn.
No one.	Qofna ma jiro qofna.
Probably a good thing.	Malaha wax wanaagsan.
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
Who came out earlier.	Yaa hore uga soo baxay.
This was not the case.	Tani ma ahayn mid.
This is set very close.	Tan waxaa la dhigay meel aad ugu dhow.
It's really hard.	Runtii way adag tahay.
That is not a new idea.	Taasi fikrad cusub maaha.
That is a clear lie.	Taasi waa been cad.
I really don't see that.	Runtii taas ma arko.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
So he said.	Sidaas ayuu yidhi.
I really need it clearly.	Waxaan runtii u baahanahay si cad.
That is not true!	Taasi run maaha!
But what is it.	Laakiin waa maxay.
You had.	Waxaad lahayd.
It didn't take long.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer.
Something, him going.	Wax, isaga oo u socda.
There is no tomorrow here.	Ma jiro berri halkan.
There was one other person in the room.	Qolka waxaa ku jiray hal qof oo kale.
Has told you.	Ayaa kuu sheegay.
I won't get it anymore.	Ma heli doono mar dambe.
It is always true.	Had iyo jeer waa run.
There was no one else here.	Halkan qof kale ma jirin.
Not many friends.	Ma badna saaxiibo.
Do a good job.	Qabo shaqo wanaagsan.
So much here.	Aad u badan halkan.
She did not speak again.	Mar dambe ma aysan hadlin.
I would expect.	waan filan lahaa.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
Strangely speaking.	Si la yaab leh oo loo hadlo.
But that doesn't matter.	Laakiin taas waxba kuma qabo.
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
I do not feel that way.	Ma dareemayo sidaas.
You know you have.	Waad ogtahay inaad leedahay.
She was smart.	Waxay ahayd mid caqli badan.
Maybe I didn't like it.	Malaha ma jeclayn.
There had to be something he could do.	Waxay ahayd inay jirto wax uu samayn karo.
I have no idea what they are.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxay yihiin.
It was a good thing.	Wax wanaagsan bay ahayd.
He had little.	Waxa uu lahaa wax yar.
Much has been left unsaid.	Wax badan ayaa laga tagay oo aan la sheegin.
But he can talk.	Laakiin wuu hadli karaa.
I didn't even want to see it.	Xitaa maan rabin inaan arko.
I still have a lot to say.	Weli wax badan oo aan sheego ayaan hayaa.
I am like that.	Waxaan ahay sidii taas oo kale.
In the same way as you.	Si la mid ah adiga.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
Really, really great.	Runtii, runtii way weyn tahay.
I don't know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxa uu sameeyo.
Now it took me again.	Hadda ayaa mar kale i qaaday.
At one point he put it well.	Hal mar ayuu si fiican u dhigay.
What to do.	Waa maxay waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo.
And mostly for you.	Iyo inta badan adiga.
It's so bad!	Aad bay u xun tahay!
I couldn't leave, not now.	Ma bixi karin, hadda maaha.
It contains.	Waxa ku jira.
He must have wanted you to know.	Waa inuu rabay inaad ogaato.
He is alive now.	Hadda wuu nool yahay.
But now it was no problem.	Laakiin hadda dhib ma lahayn.
There was nothing she could do for me.	Wax ay igu samayn karto ma jirin.
Neither me nor anyone else.	Aniga iyo mid kale ma jiro.
I will be leaving soon	dhawaan ayaan bixi doonaa
Close to home	U dhow guriga
That we can see.	In aan arki karno.
It's hard, but he liked it.	Way adag tahay, laakiin taas wuu ka helay.
They must.	Waa inay.
It seems to exist.	Waxay u egtahay inay jirto.
There is something wrong with that.	Wax been ah baa ka jira.
Much needs to be said, and urgent.	Wax badan ayaa u baahan in la sheego, oo degdeg ah.
Not really.	Runtii sidaas uma aha.
But it can't be.	Laakiin ma noqon karto.
Not halfway.	Ma rabin.
All lies, lies, lies.	Dhammaan been, been, been.
And maybe you are nothing.	Oo malaha adiga waxba maaha.
That may not be true.	Taasi waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan run ahayn.
He may not know what it is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uusan garanayn waxa ay tahay.
He should not be present.	Waa inuusan joogin.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
It probably is as it is.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay sida ay tahay.
It was the same time.	Waxay ahayd waqti isku mid ah.
If someone came home it would give them time.	Haddii qof uu guriga yimaado waxay siin lahayd wakhti.
He said quickly.	Degdeg ayuu yidhi.
Much is less than lack.	Wax badan ayaa ka yar la'aan la'aan.
But too much is bad.	Laakiin aad u badan ayaa xun.
He is really good.	Runtii wuu fiican yahay.
You are new to this.	Tan waad ku cusub tahay.
It can be good	Way fiicnaan kartaa
And needs something done.	Oo u baahan wax la sameeyo.
But no one did.	Laakiin qofna ma samayn.
There was a lot.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
That would be amazing.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax la yaab leh.
They won't do much.	Wax badan ma yeeli doonaan.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
I have done a lot.	wax badan ayaan sameeyay.
She really did.	Runtii way tidhi.
Maybe that was true.	Malaha taasi run bay ahayd.
No one knows what will happen.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
I can't lie.	Been ma sheegi karo.
I know it well.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
He said he would not do that.	Wuxuu yidhi ma yeeli doono taas.
I have already tried	mar hore ayaan isku dayay
All of this was very interesting.	Dhammaan tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
You know you want it !.	Waad ogtahay inaad rabto!.
She should not have known why.	Ma ahayn inay ogaato sababta.
I made a lot of money.	Waxaan sameeyay lacag aad u badan.
I had to get it right.	Waxay ahayd inaan si sax ah u helo.
He should not have done that.	Ma ahayn inuu taas sameeyo.
Nothing to say.	Wax la sheego ma jiro.
I found this strange.	Tan waxaan u arkay wax la yaab leh.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
I would do nothing for you	Waxba waan kuu qaban lahaa
I can’t be the only person here.	Ma noqon karo qofka kaliya ee halkan.
But there is.	Laakiin waxaa jira.
IAM	waxaan ahay
If she has, fine.	Haddii ay leedahay, fiican.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay .
It's good for you.	Way kuu fiican tahay.
Now I am sure.	Hadda waan hubaa.
That could be any of us.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
Nothing else is reported today.	Wax kale oo maanta la soo sheego ma jiraan.
Really the place.	Runtii meesha.
Very good indeed.	Aad u fiican runtii.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
It's really bad.	Runtii aad bay u xun tahay.
Why did you promise to help?	Maxaad u ballan qaaday inaad caawiso?
Even a little taller than you	Xitaa wax yar kaa dheer
He told me not to leave.	Wuxuu igu yidhi ha bixin.
There are no more lies.	Been dambe ma jirto.
He would do it if he could.	Wuu samayn lahaa haddii uu awoodo.
No one.	Cidna maaha.
That’s how you do something.	Taasi waa sida wax aad samayn lahayd.
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
Good job!	Shaqo wanaagsan!
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
He would do a lot.	Wax badan ayuu samayn lahaa.
what did you do 	maxaad samaysay?
He knows who he is.	Wuu garanayaa qofka uu yahay.
That is another thing she said.	Taasi waa wax kale oo ay tidhi.
He wanted this.	Waxa uu rabay tan.
Everyone had the same opportunity.	Qof kastaa wuxuu helay fursad isku mid ah.
But he was always lucky.	Laakiin waligiis nasiib buu lahaa.
Here it is beautiful.	Halkan waa mid qurux badan.
Now he is back.	Hadda dib buu u noqday.
This was not a new idea.	Tani ma ahayn fikrad cusub.
I would like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa.
Don't talk to me like that.	Ha ila hadlin sidaas.
I'm sorry it was you.	Waan ka xumahay inay ahayd adiga.
That's a lot.	Taas oo badan.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
Things to do	Waxyaabo la sameeyo
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
I will even cook for you.	Xitaa waan kuu karin doonaa.
It is here already, always.	Waa halkan mar hore, had iyo jeer.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
But this is what he did.	Laakiin tani waa waxa uu sameeyay.
Once, and once, he was here.	Mar, iyo hal mar, ayuu halkan joogay.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
It really is the other way around.	Runtii waa si kale.
We would have done this for a while.	Waxaan tan sameyn lahayn in muddo ah.
You can have it if you want.	Waad haysan kartaa haddii aad rabto.
I have an idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad.
There is no other time to get that.	Ma jiro wakhti kale oo aad taas ku heli karto.
I did not want to tell you.	Maan rabin inaan kuu sheego.
Certainly never did.	Hubaal weligay ma samayn.
There must be more.	Waa inay jiraan wax badan.
It was an interesting idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad xiiso leh.
But it was near.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax dhow.
Now, very much so.	Hadda, aad iyo aad.
Something to talk about.	Wax laga hadlo.
and.	iyo.
Everything is an idea.	Wax walba waa fikrad.
But worst of all.	Laakiin ugu xun.
That was a few years ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
A little.	Wax yar.
All that was before.	Dhammaan wixii hore ahaa.
But he never came.	Laakiin waligiis ma iman.
I will stop.	Waan joojin doonaa.
She did.	Way samaysay.
There was only.	Waxaa jiray kaliya.
Today was a very exciting day.	Maanta waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I didn’t get it all.	Ma aanan helin dhammaan.
How very interesting.	Sidee aad u xiiso badan.
I do not like this.	Ma jecli kan.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
No one came out.	Qofna uma soo bixin.
I do not know where.	Ma garanayo meel.
I decided not to.	Waxaan go'aansaday in aan.
It was a great place.	Waxay ahayd meel weyn.
It turned out well.	Si fiican ayuu u soo baxay.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It was very small.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
Xun.	Xun.
They are bigger and taller.	Way ka weyn yihiin oo way dheer yihiin.
Much was right.	In badan ayaa sax ahayd.
I'm sure of this.	Waxaan hubaa arrintan.
I did.	Waan sameeyay.
This is so beautiful.	Tani waa mid aad u qurux badan.
This is now given to us.	Tani hadda waa nala siiyay.
I am very sorry.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
I do not like to talk.	Ma jecli inaan hadlo.
That is how bad they are.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun yihiin.
It was him.	Waxay ahayd isaga.
Anything you can think of.	Wax kasta oo aad u malayn karto.
Really.	Run ahaantii.
Obviously I assumed this was a good thing.	Sida iska cad waxaan u qaatay inay tani tahay wax wanaagsan.
I can't say how it was.	Ma sheegi karo sida ay ahayd.
If it is nothing, it is nothing.	Haddii aanay waxba ahayn, waxba maaha.
They need him, and everything he sees.	Waxay u baahan yihiin isaga, iyo wax kasta oo uu arkay.
I don't understand why he is here.	Ma fahmin sababta uu halkan u joogo.
They gave nothing.	Waxba ma ay siin.
I can't do anything.	Waxba ma samayn karo.
I did not come.	Ma iman.
You may not be able to say it quickly more than once.	Waxa laga yaabaa inaadan si degdeg ah u odhan karin wax ka badan hal mar.
You are lucky.	Nasiib baad leedahay.
It still exists.	Wali waa jiraa.
I love working with you.	Jeclahay inaan kula shaqeeyo.
This is great stuff.	Tani waa waxyaabo aad u fiican.
I have it all here	Dhammaan waxaan ku hayaa halkan
But today is not a good day.	Laakiin maanta maalin wanaagsan maaha.
I will get something else.	Wax kale ayaan heli doonaa.
Too much for everyone.	Aad iyo aad u badan qof walba.
It is a real place.	Waa meel dhab ah.
We will find him.	Waanu heli doonaa isaga.
What would you say?	maxaad odhan lahayd?.
That would be.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd.
It never goes out again.	Mar dambe ma baxo.
She did not want to.	Ma ay rabin.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
I will get it.	Waan heli doonaa.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I can't do that.	Ma samayn karo sidaas.
I hear.	waan maqlay.
I have to tell you.	Waa inaan kuu sheego.
It's just who you are.	Kaliya waa qofka aad tahay.
Do not take more	Ha qaadan wax ka badan
A little is good.	Wax yar ayaa fiican.
I really don't want to do anything other than this.	Runtii ma doonayo inaan sameeyo wax aan tan ahayn.
If anyone has an idea please let me know.	Haddii qof uu haysto fikrad kale fadlan ii soo sheeg.
If you do not have something really better.	Haddii aadan haysan wax dhab ahaantii ka fiican.
And to do so.	Iyo in ay sameeyaan.
I will not do the same.	Wax la mid ah ma samayn doono.
They clearly do not.	Waxay si cad ma.
They may not want to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan rabin.
He gave you to do it.	Waxa uu ku siiyay inaad sameyso.
I really don't know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
The main reason ,.	Sababta ugu weyn,.
This can be both positive and negative.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan iyo mid xun.
You do not need.	Uma baahnid.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
She would have won.	Way guulaysan lahayd.
He did not want to see that.	Ma uusan rabin inuu taas arko.
It was not long ago.	Ma ahayn waqti dheer ka hor.
Real work.	Shaqo dhab ah.
I really tried.	Runtii waan isku dayay.
When this is not the case, it is not.	Marka tani aysan ahayn, taasi maaha.
Lots of cars.	Baabuur badan.
Again and again.	Mar iyo mar kale .
Maybe he'll do it right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu run ku sameeyo.
Not here.	Ma jiro halkan.
We will see as tomorrow.	Waan arki doonaa sida berrito ah.
In fact, no one was there.	Dhab ahaantii, qofna ma jirin.
There is no work after this.	Wax shaqo ah ma jirto tan ka dib.
I never believed that.	Weligay taas ma rumaysan.
That is exactly what happened.	Runtii taasi waa wixii dhacay.
It wasn’t much.	Ma ahayn wax badan.
They are thought to be permanent.	Waxaa loo malaynayaa inay joogto yihiin.
I need to get something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax helo
Obviously not the same thing.	Waxa cad in aanay isku wax ahayn.
No one is available.	Hal qofna lama hayo.
I want to say.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sheego.
She did not get that.	Ma aysan helin taas.
If you do not have a place to go you can stay with us.	Haddii aadan haysan meel aad aado waad nala joogi kartaa.
I have to go first	Waa inaan marka hore aado
To do so afterwards was.	In sidaas la sameeyo ka dib waxay ahayd.
There is something else at work.	Wax kale ayaa shaqada ku jira.
Still, he was surprised.	Weli, wuu yaabay.
Nice to see you again.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko.
She looks so beautiful in person.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u qurux badan qof ahaan.
We are not ready.	Diyaar ayaan ahayn.
It has already happened again.	Mar kale ayuu hore u dhacay.
He will be great.	Wuxuu noqon doonaa mid weyn.
What do you think of someone who has never been there?	Muxuu u malaynayaa qof aan waligiis joogin?.
It can be very difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
I need a lot of money.	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag badan.
It really made me.	Dhab ahaantii way igu samaysay.
It would happen.	Way dhici lahayd.
And he was a man.	Oo nin baa ahaa.
This is said to be a bad thing.	Tani waxaa la sheegay in ay tahay wax xun.
He would not like it.	Ma uu jeclaan lahaa.
Let it come.	Ha yimaado.
Still, there was something else.	Weli, wax kale ayaa jiray.
You can stay there.	Waad joogi kartaa halkaas.
I hope it will be better.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas.
They are now.	Waxay hadda yihiin.
He knew what to do.	Wuu ogaa waxa la samayn lahaa.
You set it up.	Adiga ayaa dhigay.
You will see that they exist.	Waxaad arki doontaa inay jiraan.
I think that is how it should be done.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay sida ay tahay in la sameeyo.
And it really was a while.	Oo runtii waxay ahayd muddo.
And great too.	Iyo mid weyn sidoo kale.
And the rest.	Iyo inta kale.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I think they are good.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiican yihiin.
I never knew anyone had done it until recently.	Weligay maan ogayn in qofna uu sameeyay ilaa dhawaan.
I would not give anything.	waxba ma siin lahaa.
I will take this	tan waan qaadan doonaa
Do not tell anyone.	Cidna ha noo sheegin.
He would not do it.	Ma uu samayn lahaa.
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
He is doing a good job.	Shaqo wanaagsan ayuu hayaa.
It would just be.	Waxay noqon lahayd oo kaliya.
Everyone can see what it is.	Qof walba waa arki karaa waxa ay tahay.
Now, everyone is happy.	Hadda, qof kastaa wuu faraxsan yahay.
He felt he had to lie.	Waxa uu dareemay in ay tahay in uu been sheego.
True to say.	Run in la leeyahay.
Little is known about this.	Wax aad u yar baa taas laga ogyahay.
Not much.	Ma badna.
It can be a big job for him.	Waxay u noqon kartaa shaqo weyn isaga.
He knows very well.	Aad buu u garanayaa.
You do not need to tell them.	Uma baahnid inaad u sheegto.
He would stay.	Wuu joogi lahaa.
I will leave.	waan ka bixi doonaa.
But everything else, too.	Laakiin wax kasta oo kale, sidoo kale.
You are younger.	Waad ka yar tahay.
He thought she wanted the same thing he did.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in ay rabto isla waxa uu sameeyay.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I tried several.	Waxaan isku dayay dhowr.
There is no problem with that.	Dhib kuma jirto taas.
It didn't matter what she said.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn waxay u sheegtay.
But I must not.	Laakiin waa in aan.
We live our best.	Waxaan ku nool nahay sida ugu fiican.
It should be expected.	Waa in la filayaa.
There was nothing.	Waxba kuma jirin.
It may not be true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan run ahayn.
If you would like to stay here, fine and good.	Haddii aad jeceshahay inaad ku sii jirto halkan, si fiican oo wanaagsan.
It will be a great day.	Waxay noqon doontaa maalin weyn.
I knew what you wanted.	Waan ogaa waxaad rabto.
It's more complicated than that.	Way ka dhib badan tahay taas.
He is still there.	Wali wuu joogaa.
He started this today.	Tan maanta ayuu bilaabay.
I never thought he would do anything like that.	Weligay uma malaynayn inuu samayn doono wax sidaas oo kale ah.
Maybe another time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waqti kale.
But he stayed.	Laakiin wuu iska joogay.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
I thought it was you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga.
He was still.	Weli wuu ahaa.
That would be a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax wanaagsan.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
I do not know how we can do that.	Ma garanayo sida aan taas u samayn karno.
Not now.	Hadda ma jirto.
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
It's great.	Way weyn tahay.
This can be great.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn.
Everyone would leave.	Qof walba wuu ka tagi lahaa.
No one goes there.	Qofna halkaas ma tago.
It didn't matter to me.	Waxba igama lahayn.
Maybe there is.	Malaha waxaa jira.
I did not want to.	Maan rabin.
Not that it is a bad idea.	Ma aha in ay fikrad xun tahay.
Well he should.	Si fiican waa inuu.
I wanted to see if anyone would tell me first.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko haddii qof ii sheegi doono marka hore.
I do not.	Anigu ma sameeyo.
It looks like anywhere else now.	Waxay u egtahay meel kasta oo kale hadda.
That could be his favorite.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa uu jecel yahay.
But that's the way it is with me.	Laakiin taasi waa sida ay aniga ila tahay.
Only, here it is.	Kaliya, waa kan.
No one lies.	Qofna been uma sheego.
That is because they are clearly not the same person.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah waxay si cad u ahayn isku qof.
Something really, really, really bad.	Wax runtii, runtii, runtii aad u xun.
He wants me to go out with him.	Wuxuu rabaa inaan la baxo isaga.
No one is there.	Qofna meesha ma joogo.
And now you.	Oo hadda adiga.
'work'.	'shaqo'.
Beautiful what happened to me.	Qurux badan maxaa igu dhacay.
I want to be there so badly.	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas joogo si aad u xun.
.	.
But he has an idea.	Laakiin fikrad buu leeyahay.
I had something.	Waxaan lahaa wax.
That did.	Taasi way samaysay.
He will leave.	Wuu bixi doona.
That's right	Waa sax
Also, it is not true.	Sidoo kale, run maaha.
I did not see one coming.	Maan arag mid soo socda.
It was very busy.	Aad bay mashquul u ahayd.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
Like, a lot.	Sida, wax badan.
He was so tough!	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u adag!
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
And maybe there was more.	Oo malaha waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
And things like that.	Iyo waxyaabo ay ka mid yihiin.
No one was around.	Qofna meel u dhow ma jirin.
There is no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
I hope it will happen.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici doonto.
One year ago.	Hal sano ka hor.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay samayn.
I am not him.	Anigu ma ihi isaga.
He is a tough and tough guy.	Waa nin adag oo adag.
We would be seen.	Waa nala arki lahaa.
This is me but.	Tani waa aniga laakiin.
Too much.	Si aad u badan.
I would be happy if there is interest.	Waan ku faraxsanahay haddii ay jirto xiiso.
I don't have time for that right now.	Waqti uma hayo taas hadda.
They are very small.	Aad bay u yar yihiin.
Now he can do little.	Hadda wax yar ayuu samayn karaa.
It was an unattainable place.	Waxay ahayd meel aan la helin.
Still, it fell from there.	Weli, halkaas ayuu ka soo dhacay.
we will see again.	dib ayaan arki doonaa.
That could be.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa.
You don't have to do anything.	Ma aha inaad wax samayso.
It cannot be stopped.	Lama joojin karo.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
This can be done.	Tani waa la samayn karaa.
I wanted to see.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko.
I looked	Waan eegay
You can stay here if you want.	Halkan ayaad joogi kartaa haddii aad rabto.
He thought it was something.	Wuxuu mooday inuu wax yahay.
it will happen.	wuu dhici doonaa.
Here is what you will do.	Waa kan waxa aad sameyn doonto.
I saw a very good job.	Waxaan arkay shaqo aad u fiican.
I saw the same one later.	Waxaan arkay mid la mid ah goor dambe.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
I did it three years ago.	Waxaan sameeyay saddex sano ka hor.
It's a good job.	Waa shaqo fiican.
Maybe you have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad mid leedahay.
She would come to him.	Way u iman lahayd isaga.
Everything would be better than this.	Wax kasta ayaa ka fiicnaan lahaa tan.
Every day more and more come to me.	Maalin walba waxaa ii soo socda in ka badan iyo in ka badan.
Everyone left.	Qof kastaa wuu baxay.
I didn't want to do it now.	Ma rabin inaan hadda sameeyo.
I did not want to do this.	Maan jeclayn inaan tan sameeyo.
He did not say what happened.	Ma sheegin waxa dhacay.
Well.	Si wanaagsan.
Not much.	Wax badan kuma jiraan.
But it can't happen.	Laakiin ma dhici karto.
I don't know who you are.	Ma garanayo qofka aad tahay.
Like me.	Aniga ila mid ah.
If you haven't, you still shouldn't.	Haddii aadan samayn, weli waa inaadan samayn.
I will go there	halkaas ayaan tagi doonaa
Everyone has to leave.	Qof walba waa inuu baxo.
I need it urgently.	Waxaan u baahanahay si degdeg ah.
Maybe I started.	Malaha aniga ayaa bilaabay.
No one goes again.	Qofna mar dambe ma tago.
And again and again and again.	Oo mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale.
I felt that this was how I would be back again.	Waxa aan dareemay in ay taasi tahay sidii aan mar kale igu noqon lahaa.
But it is not.	Laakiin ma aha.
I will do it	waan samayn doonaa
Just so good.	Kaliya aad u fiican.
It included.	Waxaa ka mid ahaa.
This can not be done.	Tani ma samayn karto.
I want to be in this one.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku jiro kan.
Someone else was in the room.	Qof kale ayaa qolka ku jiray.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
I just didn’t know.	Kaliya maan garanayn.
I still can't say what it is.	Wali ma sheegi karin waxa uu yahay.
No one is here.	Qofna halkan ma joogo.
Too bad, unwanted.	Aad u xun, aan la rabin.
He is so beautiful.	Aad ayuu u qurux badan yahay.
I have an idea	Waxaan qabaa fikrad
This looks like another man.	Tani waxay u egtahay nin kale.
I have something to tell you.	wax aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa.
I can see what you do.	Waan arki karaa waxaad sameyso.
I know that.	Waan garanayaa taas.
I have no problem with that.	Wax dhib ah kuma hayo inuu yahay.
Really, nothing.	Run ahaantii, waxba ma jiraan.
Do not mention.	Ha sheegin.
There is no one but me.	Qof aan aniga ahayn ma jiro.
He didn't have much to say.	Wax badan oo uu ku hadlo ma lahayn.
Please do not do this.	Fadlan ha samayn tan.
But take this.	Laakiin tan qaado.
It was something to do.	Waxay ahayd wax la sameeyo.
I did the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan ku sameeyay.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
They are different.	Waxay kala yihiin.
I told him this would not be a problem.	Waxaan u sheegay in tani aysan dhibaato noqon doonin.
She is always very happy.	Had iyo jeer aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
Some time ago he did not have it, but now he would have it.	Waqti ka hor ma uusan haysan, laakiin hadda wuu heli lahaa.
We would leave	Waanu bixi lahayn
She did not want that.	Ma ay rabin taas.
You do not need to know now.	Uma baahnid inaad hadda ogaato.
Both can be.	Labaduba wuu noqon karaa.
Maybe she does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sameyso.
I will talk about it later.	Waan ka sii hadli doonaa.
She needs someone like you.	Waxay u baahan tahay qof adiga oo kale ah.
But soon he got to work.	Laakiin wax yar ka dib waxa uu shaqo galay.
It is not very difficult.	Ma aha mid aad u adag.
I keep everything	Wax walba waan ku hayaa
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
It can't be better.	Ma fiicnaan karto.
It’s not just you and what you want.	Ma aha oo kaliya adiga iyo waxa aad rabto.
Now he knows me.	Hadda wuu i garanayaa.
She was clearly someone else.	Waxay si cad u ahayd qof kale.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
You will be very happy.	Waxaad noqon doontaa mid aad u faraxsan.
This cannot be a coincidence.	Tani ma noqon karto wax iska yimid.
I hope you will be back soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad dhawaan soo noqon doonto.
You did nothing to me.	Waxba ima aad samayn.
As desired.	Sida la rabo.
I want it badly.	Waxaan rabaa si xun.
It can be anywhere.	Waxay noqon kartaa meel kasta.
you were a friend.	saaxiib baad ahayd.
I didn't have a car.	Baabuur ma haysan.
I know it's bad for me.	Waan ogahay inay ii xun tahay.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
There is nothing better to do.	Ma jiro wax aad uga fiican in la sameeyo.
It's not pretty	Ma qurux badna
It is really beautiful.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I don't know what she will do.	Ma garanayo waxay samayn doonto.
Only now you say you did.	Kaliya hadda waxaad sheegtay inaad samaysay.
How hard.	Sida adag.
No problem, really.	Dhib ma lahayn, runtii.
But if it's not you, that's fine too.	Laakiin haddii aysan adiga ahayn, taasi sidoo kale waa fiican tahay.
I hope you do too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale sameyso.
Something else is going on here.	Wax kale ayaa halkan ka socda.
We are happy and we live together for one.	Waan ku faraxsanahay oo waxaan u wada nool nahay hal.
I hope it helps me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay i caawiso.
Let's do this.	Aan samayno tan.
But that's the way it is.	Laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
They will help us.	Way na caawin doonaan.
He did this now.	Tani wuu sameeyay hadda.
Today was a great day.	Maanta waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
That was a few years ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
And maybe a day later.	Iyo malaha maalin ka dib.
He is a good man, you would love him.	Waa nin wanaagsan, waad jeclaan lahayd isaga.
He was certainly not one of us.	Dhab ahaantii ma ahayn mid naga mid ah.
Also, you know.	Sidoo kale, waad ogtahay.
Everything I need.	Wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay.
She will not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegi doonto.
I have never seen him like that.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale.
Who knew you had so much.	Yaa ogaa inaad wax badan lahayd.
Not like him.	Ma aha isaga oo kale.
I hope she gets a job soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhawaan shaqo heli doonto.
I got that.	Waan helay taas.
I felt for him.	Waan dareemay isaga.
Certainly not me.	Hubaal aniga maaha.
How nice to see him.	Sidee u fiican in la arko isaga.
A car is moving.	Baabuur ayaa ku socda.
I may not even be late.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa waqti dambe joogin.
I put that.	Taas ayaan dhigay.
You can leave here tomorrow.	Waxaad ka bixi kartaa halkan berrito.
Certainly it was.	Hubaal waxay ahayd.
She loves you.	Way ku jeceshahay.
You would have stopped us.	Waad naga joojin lahayd.
This is how it is now.	Tani waa sida ay hadda tahay.
Take your time.	Waqti ku qaado.
But before, nothing.	Laakiin ka hor, waxba.
we are ready	diyaar ayaan u nahay
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
Much the same.	In badan oo isku mid ah.
Maybe someone else has.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof kale leeyahay.
In fact, it may be the only one.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon kartaa mid kaliya.
But here it is.	Laakiin waa tan.
It was great.	Wax weyn bay ahayd.
I can tell you it was a bit of a chore.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa inay ahayd xoogaa shaqo ah.
Probably no one knew.	Malaha qofna ma ogayn.
I wanted money.	Waxaan rabay lacag.
It was what everyone thought.	Waxay ahayd waxa qof walba u maleeyay.
She just didn't like it.	Kaliya ma ay jeclayn.
I already felt it.	Hore ayaan u dareemay.
Obviously, she says.	Sida cad, waxay leedahay.
It's so good it can't be real.	Aad bay u fiican tahay ma noqon karto mid dhab ah.
Happy, for sure.	Ku faraxsan, hubaal.
It looks like that too.	Waxay u egtahay sidoo kale.
I know what I see.	Waan ogahay waxaan arko.
But it was not right.	Laakiin wax sax ah ma ahayn.
Not sure why you did not see that.	Ma hubo sababta aad taas u arki weyday.
It belongs to you.	Adiga ayaa iska leh.
I'll just fall for it.	Kaliya waan ku dhici doonaa.
They will give you what you want.	Waxay ku siin doonaan waxaad rabto.
I would like to have one.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mid haysto.
That can be a problem.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
But it is not as complicated as it sounds.	Laakiin ma aha sida mid aad u dhib badan.
Will they be better?	Ma fiicnaan doonaan?
That is clearly not true.	Taasi si cad sax maaha.
I need that	waan u baahanahay taas
She had to tell him.	Waxay ahayd inuu u sheego.
I'm not sure how he did that.	Ma hubo sida uu taas u sameeyay.
I lost a friend.	Waxaan waayay saaxiib.
He wanted more, he wanted more.	Wax ka badan buu rabay, wax kale ayuu rabay.
Sida.	Sida .
Maybe it's really that bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay runtii sidaas u xun tahay.
He was in a strange mood.	Niyad yaab leh ayuu ku jiray.
Maybe there are good things.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan waxyaabo fiican.
Maybe he couldn't.	Malaha wuu awoodi waayay.
I will do it now.	Hadda waan sameyn doonaa.
We never talked again.	Mar dambe ma wada hadlin.
Just this.	Kaliya tan.
We need more of us.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo naga mid ah.
That’s why you do it.	Taasi waa sababta aad u sameyso.
You will.	Waad sameyn doontaa.
you will do well	si fiican ayaad u samayn doontaa
He refused to leave.	Wuu diiday inuu baxo.
You went home.	Guriga ayaad aaday.
It can be done again.	Waa la samayn karaa mar kale.
But there was none.	Laakiin ma jirin.
I love you.	Ima jecla.
This is a long time ago.	Tani waa wakhti dheer ka hor hadda.
I wanted to do better.	Waxaan rabay inaan si ka wanaagsan sameeyo.
I can't say why.	Ma sheegi karo sababta.
He loves school.	Dugsiga wuu jecel yahay.
I can't believe this.	Ma rumaysan karo tan.
He may not really want to know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan runtii rabin inuu ogaado.
But a good idea.	Laakiin fikrad fiican.
It will take a long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti dheer.
I'm in now	Hadda ayaan galay
I think you will love it there.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad halkaas ku jeclaan doonto.
We should have done better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si ka wanaagsan samayno.
This is not a place to do that.	Tani maaha meel taas lagu sameeyo.
it was nothing and no one.	waxba ma ahayn cidna ma ahayn.
Like anything you want.	Sida wax kasta oo aad rabto.
You are smarter than me.	Waa kaa caqli badan tahay.
I desperately need it.	Aad baan ugu baahanahay.
You can hardly believe it.	Si dhib ah uma rumaysan kartid.
There was no place.	Ma jirin meel.
There was not much.	Wax badan kuma jirin.
Here it is.	Waa ku kan.
It was not a big deal.	Wax weyn ma ahayn.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay in la yaqaan.
If it is money you just need it.	Haddii ay tahay lacag kaliya waxaad u baahan tahay.
He would like to know what happened to me.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu ogaado waxa igu dhacay.
It's a great idea.	Waa fikrad aad u fiican.
It looks like a lot of money.	Waxay u egtahay lacag badan.
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
That will definitely help.	Taasi waa hubaal inay caawiso.
I just didn't like it.	Kaliya maan jeclayn.
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
I was no longer there.	I ma jirin mar dambe.
It didn't pay off.	Waxba kama aysan bixin.
He knows something is not right.	Wuu ogyahay in wax aanay sax ahayn.
I wish you all the best.	Wax walba waan kuu rajeynayaa.
I know nothing.	Waxba waan ogahay.
I just don't know what.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxa.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
They need you more than you need this.	Waxay kuu baahan yihiin in ka badan inta aad tan u baahan tahay .
I had food.	Waxaan lahaa cunto.
That will not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon doonto.
He knows.	Wuu garanayaa.
But it was not found.	Laakiin waa la heli waayay.
I started to find out about it.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan wax ka ogaado.
That is not something here.	Taasi maaha wax halkan ah.
I have to.	Waa inaan.
And here it is.	Oo waa tan.
I thought telling a friend would be a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay in aan u sheego saaxiib waxay noqon lahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
There is no one better than me.	Ma jiro qof iga fiican oo aan ka heli karo aniga.
And everywhere.	Iyo meel walba.
What a surprise.	Maxaa yaab leh.
You do not need this.	Uma baahnid tan.
He seemed to have no idea what had happened to him.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid aan garanayn waxa ku dhacay.
We did not need it.	Uma baahnayn.
This is correct.	Tani waa sax.
A very difficult time, really.	Waqti aad u adag, dhab ahaantii.
This is done now.	Tani hadda waa la sameeyaa.
I bought a new car today.	Waxaan iibsaday baabuur cusub maanta.
The worst thing she can do.	Waxa ugu xun ee ay samayn karto.
He just wants to work.	Kaliya wuxuu rabaa inuu shaqeeyo.
I do this at home.	Waxaan tan ku sameeyaa guriga.
He is there.	Halkaas ayuu joogaa.
You can always beautifully get three.	Waxaad had iyo jeer si qurux badan u heli kartaa saddex.
As you can see, it is now ready.	Sida aad arki karto, hadda waa diyaar.
But otherwise, it is the same.	Laakiin si kale, waa isku mid.
I did a good job, too.	Shaqo wanaagsan ayaan sameeyay, sidoo kale.
But, there is something to be expected.	Laakiin, waxaa jira wax la rajaynayo.
Take a few years if you want.	Qaado dhowr sano haddii aad rabto.
But, he said, there was more.	Laakiin, wuxuu yidhi, waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
Whatever it was no longer a problem.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd dhib dambe ma lahayn.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
But it is not.	Laakiin ma aha.
He certainly did not.	Dhab ahaantii ma uusan lahayn.
Not here.	Ma aha halkan.
This was true.	Tani run bay ahayd.
There are a few other things that are needed.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo yar oo loo baahan yahay.
There was a real promise there.	Waxaa jiray ballan dhab ah halkaas.
There is no problem, there is no problem.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan, wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
No known problems.	Wax dhibaato ah oo la garanayo ma jirto.
And not just here.	Oo halkan kaliya maaha.
Not so now.	Hadda sidaas maaha.
I have to do less.	Waa inaan wax ka yar sameeyaa.
No one talked anymore.	Qofna mar dambe ma wada hadlin.
He was a tall man.	Nin dheer buu ahaa.
But it will not get any better.	Laakiin ma sii fiicnaan doonto.
There is another.	Mid kale ayaa jira.
They are in for a surprise.	Waxay ku jiraan yaab.
He was very surprised.	Aad buu ula yaabay.
I love that	waan jeclahay taas
We are excited about what is coming !!.	Waanu ku faraxsanahay waxa soo socda!!.
I have a job for you	shaqo baan kuu hayaa
Not good, not great.	Ma aha mid wanaagsan, mid weyn.
But it is something.	Laakiin waa wax.
There is only this.	Waxaa jira tan kaliya.
I became right.	Waxaan noqday sax.
But we are what we are.	Laakiin waxaan nahay waxa aan nahay.
I think that was it.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd.
It is likely to be difficult for everyone.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ku adag tahay qof walba.
nothing.	waxba.
You will be fine, you will get it.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa, waad heli doontaa.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
Mar.	Mar.
There are some interesting things going on here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo xiiso leh oo halkan ka socda.
It sounds real.	Waxay u egtahay run.
And left.	Oo ka tagay.
Sure.	Hubaal.
It was hard work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
She would.	Way lahayd.
It is something to be seen.	Waa wax la arko.
This would take money.	Tani waxay qaadan lahayd lacag.
As he did not want to say.	Sida ma uusan rabin inuu sheego.
But there is not much we can do.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax badan oo aan sameyn karno.
No one likes to be told what to do.	Qofna ma jecla in loo sheego waxa la samaynayo.
Not only that.	Ma aha oo kaliya.
He will stay here with me.	Halkan ayuu ila joogi doonaa.
You can't do anything.	Wax ma samayn kartid.
I do not see him.	Ma arko isaga.
I love getting people.	Waxaan jeclahay in aan dadka helo.
He liked that.	Taas wuu ka helay.
There was nothing that surprised him.	Ma jirin wax isaga la yaabay.
Too much.	Mid aad u badan.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
I do not want to go	Ma rabo inaan aado
He was not ready, he was not ready.	Diyaar uma ahayn, diyaar uma ahayn.
Let me know how much you need	I soo sheeg inta aad u baahan tahay
The house will fall on you.	Guriga ayaa kugu soo dhici doona.
You can do it yourself.	Adiga keligaa ayaad samayn kartaa.
Just a year ago.	Kaliya hal sano ka hor.
You have to do it now, really.	Waa in aad hadda samayso, dhab ahaantii.
I'm sorry about everything.	Wax walba waan ka xumahay.
he refused to talk.	wuu diiday inuu ka hadlo.
It's good for you.	Way kuu fiican tahay.
It didn't matter to me.	Waxba igama lahayn.
Much longer.	In badan oo dheer.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
That is hard work.	Taasi waa shaqo adag.
Everyone needs a car today!	Qof walba maanta baabuur buu u baahan yahay!
We can't stay here.	Halkan kuma joogi karno.
pay me now.	i bixi hadda.
He had a husband.	Nin baa la lahaa.
I think it is true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay.
Strictly speaking, they were not smart.	Marka si adag loo hadlo, ma ay ahayn caqli badan.
You can't believe what he said.	Ma rumaysan kartid waxa uu yidhi.
This is exactly what has been seen.	Runtii tani waa waxa la arkay.
Do not tell anyone what is really going on.	Cidna ha u sheegin waxa run ahaantii socda.
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
That may not be right!	Taasi sax ma noqon karto!
Why didn't you come?	Maxaad u iman wayday?
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
Everyone knows what it looks like.	Qof kastaa waa yaqaan sida ay u egtahay.
Not everyone does that.	Qof kastaa ma sameeyo taas.
This includes everything.	Tan waxaa ku jira wax walba.
That is what you do.	Taasi waa waxa aad sameyso.
Now you are a man.	Hadda waxaad tahay nin.
I saw it with difficulty.	Si dhib ah ayaan u arkay.
he would get even.	wuu heli lahaa xitaa.
Not how I need him.	Ma aha sida aan isaga u baahanahay.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
I just love it so much.	Kaliya aad ayaan u jeclahay.
I will get this for everyone.	Waxaan heli doonaa qof walba tan.
But there are none.	Laakiin ma jiraan.
I am not interesting.	Ma ihi mid xiiso leh.
I am a person	waxaan ahay qof
Do not like too much and too much.	Ha jeclayn wax badan iyo wax ka badan.
I think that's right.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi sax tahay.
That was not a big surprise.	Taasi la yaab weyn ma ahayn.
I decided to leave.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan baxo.
I am still in it.	Wali waan ku jiraa.
It was nothing, really.	Waxba ma ahayn, runtii.
But that.	Laakiin taasi .
This is the best.	Tani waa tan ugu wanaagsan.
I would love to do that again.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas mar kale sameeyo.
I will do something about it.	Wax baan ka samayn doonaa isaga.
It should not have existed.	Ma ahayn inay jirto.
This was really a problem.	Runtii tani waxay ahayd dhibaato.
Don't do this to me.	Tan ha igu samayn.
I had to leave.	Waxay ahayd inaan ka baxo.
Every car, really.	Baabuur kasta, dhab ahaantii.
Maybe a lot of things.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waxyaabo badan.
I know exactly.	Waan ogahay si sax ah.
It really is everything.	Runtii waa wax walba.
You can't come out	Ma soo bixi kartid
He had something to say about this.	Waxa uu lahaa wax loo sheego tan.
There is nowhere to go.	Ma jiro meel la aado.
Which is not really like him.	Taas oo aan runtii isaga la mid ahayn.
But he was a good person.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa qof wanaagsan.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Wax aad u xun ma jiraan.
I really don't like it.	Runtii ma jecli.
Wonder, isn't it?	Yaab, miyaanay ahayn?
It was brand new and fresh.	Waxay ahayd mid cusub oo cusub.
It will do a great job.	Waxay qaban doontaa shaqo weyn.
I knew it well.	Si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
Maybe that's not a bad thing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi aysan ahayn wax xun.
That is amazing.	Taasi waa yaab.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
I was unable to do so.	Waan awoodi waayay inaan sameeyo.
I had to be like him.	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga oo kale noqdo.
I really think this will help.	Runtii waxaan filayaa in tani ay caawin doonto.
But not me.	Laakiin aniga igama aha.
There is really nothing better than that.	Runtii wax taas ka fiican ma jirto.
He really decided.	Runtii wuu go'aansaday.
Great job.	Shaqo weyn.
That was bad.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xun.
It is not.	Ma aha.
But you can't be that way.	Laakiin sidaas kuma ahaan kartid.
People who love you.	Dadka adiga ku jecel.
He took another.	Mid kale ayuu qaatay.
They are happy!	Way faraxsan yihiin!
But something else happened.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa dhacay.
As even today.	Sida xitaa maanta.
I had nothing to do here.	Halkan wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn.
She didn't want this.	Ma ay rabin tan.
He looked bad now.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid xun hadda.
It may never be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan waligiis ahaan doonin.
A man has been arrested.	Nin baa xabsiga la dhigay.
I love being myself.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan ahay aniga.
Some time ago, not recently.	Waqti ka hor, dhawaan maaha.
Tell everyone what you do.	U sheeg qof walba waxaad sameyso.
He arrived shortly.	Waqti yar ayuu yimid.
I was everything.	Waxaan ahaa wax walba.
He said he really liked it.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu aad uga helay.
I have an idea of ​​what we can do.	Waxaan leeyahay fikrad ah waxa aan samayn karno.
Maybe it could end, as before.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uu ku dhammaan karo, sidii hore.
It really looks like everyone has had a good time.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay in qof walba uu waqti fiican qaatay.
I, one, will not do anything.	Anigu, mid, waxba kuma samayn doono.
Nothing constantly.	Waxba si joogto ah.
I can't stop.	Ima joojin karto.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
But that is not all.	Laakiin halkaas kuma eka.
I knew it would happen.	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto.
Very good for him.	Aad u wanaagsan isaga.
Not all are correct.	Dhammaan sax maaha.
It was here first.	Waxay ahayd halkan marka hore.
I look forward to tomorrow.	Waan ku faraxsanahay berrito.
I was not	maan ahayn
You will love it !.	Waad jeclaan doontaa!.
This is not the end.	Tani ma dhammaan.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I think that would be great.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi noqon doonto mid aad u fiican.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
I just want to get out of here.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ka baxo.
Also here.	Sidoo kale halkan.
I found it at home	Waan ka helay guriga
I would pay to see him again.	Waxaan bixin lahaa si aan mar kale u arko.
They are close to home	Waxay ku dhow yihiin guriga
Probably more.	Malaha ka badan.
You might as well.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale jeclaan lahayd.
that is when.	waa marka .
They live everywhere.	Waxay ku nool yihiin meel kasta.
Tell me where you are.	Meesha aad joogto ii sheeg.
That was as it was.	Taasi waxay ahayd sidii ay ahayd.
I was lucky here.	halkan ayaan nasiib ku helay.
I was told.	Waa la ii sheegay.
There is no time now.	Hadda waqti ma jiro.
But you did not say.	Laakiin ma aadan sheegin.
To talk about.	Si aan uga hadlo.
If he finds you here, he will find you there.	Haddii uu halkan ku helo, halkaas ayuu kugu heli doonaa.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
They do, they do, but they will not do anything new.	Waxay sameeyaan, way sameeyaan, laakiin ma samayn doonaan wax cusub.
I want you to know that.	Waxaan rabaa inaad taas ogaato.
Don't tell anyone who told you.	Qof kuu sheegay ha u sheegin.
Anyone can do any job.	Qof kastaa wuu qaban karaa shaqo kasta.
You can find him here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa isaga halkan.
And what good work you have clearly done.	Oo maxay tahay shaqo fiican oo aad si cad u samaysay.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
Think more of him.	Wax badan ka qabo isaga.
I don't have to.	Ma aha inaan.
You can be whatever you want.	Waxaad noqon kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I think this is it.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay.
He refused to say anything.	Wuu diiday inuu wax sheego.
But nothing was done.	Laakiin waxba lama qaban.
It is the only thing you have to do.	Waa waxa kaliya ee ay tahay inaad sameyso.
Either way it could be.	Si kasta oo ay taasi noqon karto.
Who said what.	Yaa yidhi maxaa.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
I don't have time.	Waqti ma hayo.
There was so much food to eat!	Waxaa jiray cunto aad u badan oo la cuno!
Everyone is good at him.	Qof walba isaga ayaa ku fiican.
Interesting.	Xiiso leh.
It really is one.	Runtii waa mid.
I would be fine.	Waan ku fiicnaan lahaa.
I heard a lot.	Wax badan ayaan maqlay.
They will not get it.	Ma heli doonaan.
He took it with me.	Aniga ayaa ila qaatay.
I don't see that.	Ma arko taas.
It can take time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti.
It should not exist.	Waa in aanay jirin.
That will be fine.	Taasi way fiicnaan doontaa.
You can stay home with us.	Waad nala joogi kartaa guriga.
Good day?	Maalin wanaagsan?
Don't do this.	Ha samayn tan.
Very good indeed.	Aad u fiican runtii.
They do this with a lot of money.	Waxay sidaas ku sameeyaan lacag badan.
Even if that is true, it will not help much.	Xitaa haddii ay taasi run tahay, wax badan ma caawin doonto.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
Now we would get nothing.	Hadda waxba ma heli lahayn.
I can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karo.
It is very new.	Waa wax aad ugu cusub.
I know you love me.	Waan ogahay inaad i jeceshahay.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
I know just what you need.	Waan ogahay kaliya waxaad u baahan tahay.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
No one else would.	Qof kale ma samayn lahaa.
I do not want to.	Ma doonayo inaan.
I know that for sure.	Waan ogahay taas waa hubaal.
This was for me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd mid aniga.
it would come.	way iman lahayd.
He really wasn't there.	Runtii ma uu joogin.
You can be a friend later.	Waxaad noqon kartaa saaxiib dambe.
It is very difficult to know what is best.	Aad bay u adag tahay in la ogaado waxa ugu fiican.
There was a lot of interest in him.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo xiiso leh isaga.
I'm back.	Waan soo noqday.
I'm pretty sure this is it.	Aad ayaan u hubaa in tani ay tahay.
It was a great place.	Waxay ahayd meel weyn.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I thought you were busy.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay shaqo.
I hope that is just me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi aniga kaliya tahay.
And another, one older, another man.	Iyo mid kale, mid ka weyn, oo nin kale ah.
He could not.	Waa uu awoodi waayay.
I haven't seen it in a long time.	Waqti dheer ma arag.
I have something for someone else.	Wax baan ku hayaa qof kale.
But, you know?	Laakiin, ma ogtahay?
He was even more surprised.	Wuu sii yaabay.
But she is probably at work now.	Laakiin waxay u badan tahay inay hadda shaqada ku jirto.
The former happened here.	Kii hore ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
One seemed happy.	Mid faraxsan baa u muuqday.
Maybe you will too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale sameyn doonto.
I was denied food.	Cunto waa la iga diiday.
Can you give me	Ma i siin kartaa
This can be found here.	Tan waxaa laga heli karaa halkan.
That's what you want.	Taas aad rabto.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
More than enough.	In ka badan oo ku filan.
But that was not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya ma ahayn.
It was really a good place.	Runtii meel fiican bay ahayd.
That is not what I want.	Taasi maaha waxa aan rabo.
There is nothing else he can do, really.	Wax kale oo uu ka qaban karo ma jiro, runtii.
I can't leave	Ma bixi karo
I was ready for it.	diyaar ayaan u ahaa.
I told him the truth.	Run baan u sheegay.
She would definitely see this.	Hubaal way arki lahayd tan.
He did not go.	Ma uu tagi jirin.
I will be tough. 	Waxaan noqon doonaa mid adag. 
Why does everyone talk so fast?	Waa maxay sababta qof kastaa si degdeg ah u hadlo?
It really is a good idea.	Runtii waa fikrad wanaagsan.
I have no problem with him.	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo isaga.
No one is feeling here.	Qofna halkan kuma dareemayo adiga.
Really no one can.	Runtii qofna ma awoodo.
I will not do that again.	Mar dambe taas ma yeeli doono.
It would be a busy day.	Waxay ahaan lahayd maalin mashquul ah.
You can do whatever you need.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
It would be here so.	Waxay ahaan lahayd halkan sidaas.
He is indeed a good man.	Runtii waa nin wanaagsan.
It is a good day.	Waa maalin wanaagsan.
Something similar to this and this.	Wax la mid ah kan iyo kan.
I know how bad it is now.	Waan ogahay sida ay u xun tahay hadda.
I do not like that.	Ma jecli taas.
Here it is! 	Waa kan!
You can be anyone you can be.	Waxaad noqon kartaa qof kasta oo aad noqon karto.
I can't see very well.	Si fiican wax uma arki karo.
Very bad idea.	Fikrad aad u xun.
I have to do something.	Waa inaan wax sameeyaa.
You know that can't happen.	Waad ogtahay inaysan taasi dhici karin.
But, this is nothing new.	Laakiin, tani maaha wax cusub.
He put me here.	Halkan ayuu i dhigay.
I don't know how she does it.	Ma garanayo sida ay u sameyso.
That was until recently.	Taasi waxay ahayd ilaa dhawaan.
And and and.	Iyo iyo iyo.
In fact, he had.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu lahaa.
I came out.	Waan ka soo baxay.
But it was.	Laakiin waxay ahayd.
They are not even right.	Xitaa sax ma yihiin.
I have to do it.	Waa inaan sameeyaa.
It's me and you now.	Waa aniga iyo adiga hadda.
It was a lot.	Waxay ahayd wax badan.
No luck.	Nasiib ma leh.
They still do not.	Wali ma sameeyaan.
How great is he.	Sidee u weyn isaga.
He is a man.	Waa nin.
I want you to tell me everything.	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax walba ii sheegto.
I say that is not the case.	Waxaan leeyahay taasi maaha.
I do not want to see this.	Ma rabo inaan arko tan.
She's very smart, you know.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay, waad ogtahay.
Mid.	Mid.
He knows he doesn't have to.	Wuu ogyahay inuusan lahayn.
Maybe a little too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xoogaa aad u badan.
She would get that.	Way heli lahayd sidaas.
There was so much they did not know.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo aysan ogeyn.
We can't say anything.	Waxba ma odhan karno.
Nothing new.	Wax ku cusub ma jiraan.
Let's do this.	Aan samayno tan.
But, now.	Laakiin, hadda.
I told you what happened.	maxaa dhacay waan kuu sheegay.
Is anyone there?	Ma jiraa qof jira?
This is something that is clearly taken for granted.	Tani waa wax si cad loo qaatay.
You really should not do that.	Runtii waa inaadan taas samayn.
What to do.	Maxaa in la sameeyaa.
He is too tall for me.	Aad buu iga dheer yahay.
It sounds like a good idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad wanaagsan.
If so, that's the way it is.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, waa sida ay tahay.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu ka hadlo.
I wanted you	waan ku rabay
It's the same here.	Waa sidaas oo kale halkan.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
Everyone has a car.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay baabuur.
Not all.	Ma dhammaan.
It really has to be seen.	Runtii waa in la arko.
But not much.	Laakiin ma aha wax badan.
But I found nothing else.	Laakiin ma helin wax kale.
I don't like to see you there.	Ma jecli inaan halkaas ku arko.
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma uu sheegin.
It is a promise.	Waa ballan.
She said she was fine.	Waxay tidhi way wanaagsan tahay.
I need to be like everyone else.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan noqdo sida dadka kale.
He was a really good guy.	Runtii nin fiican buu ahaa.
He had to do something.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax sameeyo.
It may have been small.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ahaa mid yar.
But first of all.	Laakiin marka hore wax walba.
You can always get better.	Mar walba waad fiicnaan kartaa.
Please do not be like that.	Fadlan sidaas ha noqon.
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
But it does not matter who lives like that today.	Laakiin dhib ma leh qof sidaas u nool maanta.
I rejected you	waan ku diiday
Now, it was time for her.	Hadda, waxay ahayd markii ay diyaar ahayd.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
Well done!	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay!
There really is not much we can do.	Runtii wax badan oo aan qaban karno ma jiraan.
Not pretty, really.	Ma qurux badna, dhab ahaan.
I am very happy to be here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
He is small and he is small.	Wuu yar yahay oo wuu yar yahay.
I love him less and less.	Waan jeclahay isaga in ka yar iyo in ka yar.
Now it can be anyone.	Hadda waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
Even now, he did not know why.	Xitaa hadda, ma uu garanayn sababta.
This is not a good idea.	Tani maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
It is there	Waa halkaas
I really think she can.	Waxaan runtii u maleynayaa inay awoodi karto.
I already had.	Mar hore ayaan lahaa.
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
You have to stay.	Waa inaad joogto.
I really can't find enough.	Runtii ma heli karo wax ku filan.
Don't talk.	Ha hadlin.
I am really happy to have the opportunity.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan fursad u helo.
That is what it is.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay.
It was a lot.	Wax badan bay ahayd.
It felt right.	Waxa la dareemay sax.
That was a thing.	Taas oo ahayd wax.
But you know.	Laakiin waad ogtahay .
I haven't seen you in a while and.	Muddo kuma arag iyo.
Maybe he is really good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu runtii wanaagsan yahay.
Too bad.	Dhib badan.
He was not there.	Halkaas ma jirin.
Not yet.	Wali maaha.
I did not have time.	Waqti ma helin.
This is new to me.	Tani waa igu cusub.
They had to do something new.	Waxay ahayd inay sameeyaan wax cusub.
To be there for me.	In aan halkaas ii joogo.
That must have been beautiful.	Taasi waa inay ahayd mid qurux badan.
He knew what needed to be done.	Wuu ogaa waxa loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
A lot is clear to me.	Wax badan ayaa ii cad.
He said a lot is true.	Waxa uu sheegay in wax badan ay run yihiin.
Which is good for me.	Taas oo aniga ila fiican.
There was so much to do and see.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo la qaban lahaa oo la arki lahaa.
It still doesn't work	Wali ma shaqeeyo
This should not be done.	Tani waa in aan la samayn.
tell me you love me	ii sheeg inaad i jeceshahay.
But there was someone who came back there.	Laakiin waxaa jiray qof halkaas ku soo noqday.
Now, friend.	Hadda, saaxiib.
But they will not be there.	Laakiin ma ay ahaan doonaan halkaas.
Someone must have told you.	Waa in qof kuu sheegay.
Now he is back.	Hadda dib buu u soo noqday.
It's me, he said to himself.	Waa aniga, ayuu is yidhi.
But tell me this.	Laakiin tan ii sheeg.
She did not want him.	Ma rabin inay isaga rabto.
It is right here	Waa isla halkan
he refused to let me go.	wuu ii diiday inaan tago.
I'm really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
He began to speak.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu hadlo.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
No one really knows what happened.	Qofna ma garanayo runtii waxa dhacay.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
Not much to say.	Wax badan oo dhan in laga sheego maaha.
Very little time would have been done.	Waqti aad u yar ayaa wax lagu qaban lahaa.
It was his favorite.	Waxay ahayd uu jecel yahay.
But he was not alone.	Laakiin keligiis ma ahayn.
No one said so.	Qofna ma odhan waa sidaas.
I am very sorry for him.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga.
She had to be somewhere else.	Waxay ahayd inay meel kale joogto.
Not sure if this is what you need.	Ma hubo inay taasi tahay waxa aad u baahan tahay.
But he didn't really want to talk to anyone.	Laakiin aad uma uu rabin inuu qof la hadlo.
it is me	aniga waa aniga
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
Surprise.	Yaab.
I wondered what was said.	Waxaan la yaabay waxa la yidhi.
He left .	Wuu baxay .
I need a new place.	Waxaan u baahanahay meel cusub.
It is after.	Waa ka dib.
He has something.	Wax buu hayaa.
That is the worst.	Taasi waa tan ugu xun.
There are only three of them.	Waxaa jira saddex ka mid ah oo kaliya.
You love him.	Waad jeceshahay isaga.
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
He will be here tomorrow.	Berri ayuu halkan joogi doonaa.
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
That you are.	Taas waxaad tahay.
I went once.	Hal mar ayaan tagay.
Give it to me exactly.	Si sax ah ii sii.
You should have been older.	Waxay ahayd inaad ka weyn tahay.
Too much for any man.	Aad u badan nin kasta.
He looked, and looked.	Wuu eegay, oo eegay.
They had to do what they had to do.	Waxay ahayd inay sameeyaan wixii ay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
This really shouldn’t be surprising.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa inaysan noqon mid la yaab leh.
Sida berrito.	Sida berrito.
You are really amazing.	Runtii aad baad u yaab badan tahay.
That's what you did.	Sidaas ayaad samaysay.
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
I want him to leave.	Waxaan rabaa inuu baxo.
He saw her at the front door.	Wuxuu ku arkay albaabka hore.
It is said that he knows everything.	Waxa la yidhi wax walba wuu garanayaa.
It will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doono.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
So it is with you.	Waa sidaas adiga.
He said why he did it.	Waxa uu sheegay sababta uu u sameeyay.
He did not speak much.	In badan ma uu hadlin.
I am with you	waan kula jiraa
But it is not so difficult.	Laakiin sidaas uma dhib badna.
That's what you get	Taasi waa waxa aad ka heli
I would like to say something here.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax ka sheego halkan.
Anyone can do this.	Qof kasta wuu samayn karaa tan.
There weren’t many cars.	Ma jirin wax badan oo baabuur.
He came here yesterday.	Shalay ayuu halkan yimid.
Who he was.	Yaa ahaa.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale ma jirin.
I want to talk to him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo.
I don't know anymore.	Ma garanayo mar dambe.
I would stop	waan joojin lahaa
It will take a lot of time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u badan.
That is the only thing we can do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno.
It is as it should be.	Waa sidii la rabay.
He has to stay home.	Waa inuu guriga joogo.
That surprised me.	Taas waan la yaabay.
It's amazing!	Waa yaab!
Same room even.	Isla qolka xitaa.
Once he said.	Mar uu yidhi.
I think this will be another good one for him.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay isaga u noqon doonto mid kale oo wanaagsan.
There was no certainty.	Wax la hubo ma jirin.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
It's an amazing idea, you know.	Waa fikrad la yaab leh, waad ogtahay.
It says all there is to know.	Waxay leedahay dhammaan waxaa jira in la ogaado.
Still, it was fun.	Weli, waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu iman doono berri.
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u wanaagsan.
I did not see.	Maan arag.
But that doesn't matter.	Laakiin taasi waxba maaha.
I want it all, please.	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan, fadlan.
This was a bit surprising.	Tani waxay ahayd xoogaa la yaab leh.
It was an exciting time.	Waxay ahayd waqti xiiso badan.
We can't leave him.	Ma ka tagi karno isaga.
I did not go	Maan tagin
I asked her what she liked.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa ay jeceshahay.
That will help.	Taasi waxay ku caawin doontaa.
He looked at me and left.	Wuu i eegay oo iska baxay.
Maybe now.	Malaha hadda.
It didn't matter why.	Dhib ma lahayn sababta.
I really didn't have time.	Runtii waqti maan helin.
Needed now more than ever.	Loo baahan yahay hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
There is no way this can happen.	Ma jirto si ay tani u dhici karto.
You didn't do anything right.	Uma aadan samayn wax si sax ah.
It is obvious.	Waxaa iska cad.
I know a few.	Waan ogahay dhowr.
But today you will get it.	Laakiin maanta waad heli doontaa.
In fact, just so good anyway.	Dhab ahaantii, kaliya aad u fiican si kasta.
He may do something.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu wax sameeyo.
Don't say now.	Ha odhan hadda.
She would come tomorrow.	Berrito way iman lahayd.
I saw it here.	halkaan ayaan ku arkay.
It was a very, very bad day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u xun oo aad u xun.
You can really do it	Runtii waad samayn kartaa
Now it would be over.	Hadda way dhammaan lahayd.
They do that before they do anything else.	Waxay sameeyaan in ka hor inta aysan wax kale samayn.
He was a beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan buu ahaa.
That's what you said.	Waa waxa aad tidhi.
That was the reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta.
Everyone can see that.	Qof kasta wuu arki karaa taas.
I really did not know who he really was.	Runtii ma aan garanayn cidda uu dhab ahaantii ahaa.
A long time ago, really.	Waqti dheer ka hor, dhab ahaantii.
Several, in fact.	Dhowr, dhab ahaantii.
It doesn't look pretty.	Uma eka mid qurux badan.
I really don't want to know.	Runtii ma rabo inaan ogaado.
So far he has been helping.	Ilaa hadda wuu caawin jiray.
You must not do this.	Waa inaadan taas samayn.
I would spend even less time at home.	Waxaan ku qaadan lahaa xitaa waqti ka yar guriga.
I was there to help.	Waxaan u joogay inaan caawiyo.
That’s how things are.	Waa sida ay wax yihiin.
I really wish she was here.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay halkaan joogto.
Maybe it's something else.	Malaha waa wax kale.
It’s not that hard.	Ma aha inuu aad u adag yahay.
I know it will happen.	Waan ogahay inay dhici doonto.
.	.
I just didn’t understand.	Kaliya ma fahmin.
Everything is new.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin.
He thought he would.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in uu samayn doono.
But let me tell you, it was the best.	Laakiin aan kuu sheego, waa tan ugu fiican.
No one should buy this.	Qofna ma aha inuu tan iibsado.
I think that's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiican tahay.
I don't like to talk to you, you know.	Ma jecla inaan kula hadlo, waad ogtahay.
Here you are!	Waa kaa!.
She would get this.	Way heli lahayd tan.
Really good job.	Runtii shaqo fiican.
A friend was with me.	Saaxiib baa ila jiray.
Happy here so far.	Ku faraxsan halkan ilaa hadda.
It will be something.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax.
Pick up everything.	Soo qaado wax kasta.
He did not want to leave the house.	Ma uusan rabin inuu guriga ka baxo.
But nothing.	Laakiin waxba.
This is good.	Tani waa mid wanaagsan.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa dhib badan.
There is no problem with this.	Wax dhib ah kama jiraan tan.
All you need to know is.	Waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
I really don't have anything to say.	Runtii ma hayo si aan wax u sheego.
But still, he did.	Laakiin weli, wuu sameeyay.
We are just friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo kaliya.
I am not a person.	Anigu ma ihi qof.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
He was ready to leave.	Wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu baxo.
It's amazing today.	Waa yaab maanta.
It was not a job.	Ma ahayn shaqo.
I need some money fast	Waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa lacag degdeg ah
They must love it.	Waa inay jecel yihiin.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
Not at all.	Ma aha wax dhan.
This will help a lot.	Tani waxay si weyn u caawin doontaa.
I was tough.	Waxaan ahaa mid adag.
Can't see this.	Ma arki kartaa tan.
And several more.	Iyo dhowr kale.
This should come as no surprise.	Tani waa in aan la yaab lahayn.
This is something new.	Tani waa wax cusub.
That was not yet ready.	Taas weli diyaar uma ay ahayn.
I could not do this.	Ma aan samayn karin tan.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
Not just here.	Kaliya halkan maaha.
You will tell me.	Waad ii sheegi doontaa.
I'm sure both will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa in labaduba ay fiicnaan doonaan.
It is one.	Waa mid.
I'm glad you liked it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad jeclaan lahayd.
They are very small.	Aad bay u yar yihiin.
And not available.	Oo lama heli karo.
I do not know how to say it.	Ma garanayo si aan u sheego.
Also	Sidoo kale
But they do not.	Laakiin ma sameeyaan.
I hope she does.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sameyso.
But it does not look very good.	Laakiin uma eka mid aad u wanaagsan.
It is not such a job.	Ma aha shaqo sidaas oo kale ah.
I hope you do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso.
He did not speak.	Ma uu la hadlin.
That is the only job.	Taasi waa shaqada kaliya.
That was really fun.	Taasi dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I think that's how it was.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay sidii ay ahayd.
But it was something to do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax la sameeyo.
I knew it was him.	Waan ogaa inuu isaga ahaa.
I can be anyone.	Waxaan noqon karaa qof kasta.
This was no small feat.	Tani ma ahayn wax yar.
That’s how this was too.	Taasi waa sida tani sidoo kale ahayd.
I looked at him intently.	Aad baan u eegay isaga.
Few of us.	In yar oo naga mid ah.
Something happened to him.	Wax isaga ku jira ayaa ka dhacay.
You are good.	Waad fiican tahay.
Not much, that’s for sure.	Ma badna, taasi waa hubaal.
Both are correct.	Labaduba waa sax.
I'm sure that could happen.	Waan hubaa inay taasi dhici karto.
I have a lot.	Waxaan hayaa wax badan.
But it can be real, too.	Laakiin wuxuu noqon karaa mid dhab ah, sidoo kale.
Stop for a moment.	Xoogaa jooji.
But only if you want to.	Laakiin kaliya haddii aad rabto.
I think she is happy.	Waxaan filayaa inay faraxsan tahay.
Who had.	Yaa lahaa.
You would say that is hard to do.	Waxaad odhan doontaa taasi way adag tahay in la sameeyo.
This is also good.	Tani sidoo kale waa mid wanaagsan.
Don't you think I need this?	Miyaadan u malayn inaan u baahanahay tan?
He did not believe.	Ma uu rumaysan.
Don't do it.	Ha samayn.
But there was more.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa ku jiray.
But it is something.	Laakiin waa wax.
We are ready.	Waanu diyaar ahayn.
But it must be.	Laakiin waa in.
But not only that.	Laakiin ma aha oo kaliya.
You may want to do this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto inaad tan sameyso.
Yours.	Adiga iska leh.
Hard !.	Adag!.
I can't have it	Ma haysan karo
Then stop.	Ka dib jooji.
They clearly love it.	Waxay si cad u jecel yihiin.
Much, much bigger.	In badan, aad uga weyn.
I had several men walking.	Waxaan lahaa dhowr nin oo socda.
Not seen for a long time.	Muddo dheer lama arag.
It really is	Runtii waa run
That may not be there.	Taasi waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan halkaas joogin.
I'm afraid it won't end.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaysan dhammaan.
He may even have left home.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xitaa ka tagay guriga.
So he said.	Sidaas ayuu yidhi.
We can not do that	Ma samayn karno
I don’t think anyone is.	Uma maleynayo in qofna uusan ahayn.
Everything is fine, really.	Wax walba waa fiican yihiin, runtii.
This was a very interesting thing to do.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u xiiso badan in la sameeyo.
I had to study hard.	Waxay ahayd inaan si adag wax u barto.
Probably nothing.	Malaha waxba maaha.
I could not.	Ma awoodin.
He refused to talk to me.	Wuu diiday inuu ila hadlo.
You can do this here.	Waxaad taas ku samayn kartaa halkan.
That is what he wanted.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabay.
I am very sorry	aad baan uga xumahay
It is called.	Waa loo yaqaan.
I was busy	mashquul baan ahaa
It is the right thing to do.	Waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
Everyone does.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
It is not new.	Ma aha cusub.
Go to work.	Aad shaqada.
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
Really.	Dhab ah.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
They are very small now.	Hadda aad bay u yar yihiin.
Otherwise I would not do this.	Haddii kale ma yeeli lahaa tan.
That is why they are so big.	Waa sababta ay aad u weyn yihiin.
I will talk to you.	waan la hadli doonaa.
He loves me.	Wuu i jecel yahay.
No one would believe that.	Qofna ma rumaysan lahaa taas.
But he heard what had happened.	Laakiin wuu maqlay waxa dhacay.
Maybe that’s why it’s hard.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi tahay sababta ay u adag tahay.
He said it was good that I was.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay wanaagsan tahay in aan.
I don't seem to be working on this.	Uma eka in aan tan ku shaqeeyo.
I know how to do it.	Waan ogahay sida loo sameeyo.
He told me a lot.	Wax badan buu ii sheegay.
I will not be stopped.	La ii joojin maayo.
I became very upset.	Aad baan u noqday.
I do not know how to do it.	Ma garanayo sida aan u samayno.
You will need it.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa.
Very bad.	Aad u xun.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
He still holds me.	Weli wuu i sii hayaa.
This was very interesting.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
He seems tough.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid ku adag.
But otherwise, it looks good.	Laakiin haddii kale, wuxuu u muuqdaa mid fiican.
Everyone said.	Qof kastaa wuxuu yidhi.
It doesn't matter now.	Hadda waxba maaha.
He just wanted to come home.	Waxa uu rabay oo kaliya in uu guriga yimaado.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
They may still exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli jiraan.
He could not leave.	Ma uu ka bixi waayay.
I never knew that.	Weligay taas maan ogayn.
It is old.	Waa mid hore.
Maybe less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka yar .
Can that be true?	Taasi run ma noqon kartaa?.
Also, really.	Sidoo kale, runtii.
It was another lie.	Waxay ahayd been kale.
Tell us that.	Taas noo sheeg.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax wanaagsan.
This is another.	Tani waa mid kale.
And he came.	Oo yimid.
They will leave you.	Way kaa bixi doonaan.
Why did he come?	Waa maxay sababta uu u yimid?
I went to see him.	Waxaan u tagay inaan arko.
But what he wanted was something else.	Laakiin waxa uu rabay ayaa ahaa wax kale.
If it is difficult you can do something else.	Haddii ay adag tahay wax kale ayaad samayn kartaa.
Everything should be in place and it is now.	Wax walba waa in ay meesha ku jiraan oo hadda waa.
But really.	Laakiin runtii.
I started to help myself.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan is caawiyo.
He did not come.	Ma uu iman.
Great man.	Nin weyn.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
It really looks very interesting.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
It seems a bit difficult to me.	Waxay ila tahay wax xoogaa igu adag.
I did not want to go.	Maan rabin inaan tago.
She can't leave the house.	Ma bixi karto guriga.
She said what would you do.	Waxay ku tidhi maxaad samayn lahayd.
That is what he has.	Taasi waa waxa uu haysto.
Maybe he should go for one.	Malaha waa inuu aado mid.
But he did not find a new one.	Laakiin mid cusub ma uu helin.
He picked it up.	Wuu soo qaaday.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
The more you do this, the better you will get.	Inta badan oo aad tan sameyso, si fiican ayaad u heli doontaa.
You need an idea.	Waxaad u baahan tahay fikrad.
I need it now	hadda waan u baahanahay
But no luck.	Laakiin nasiib ma leh.
Give it more time.	Sii waqti badan.
To speak.	Si loo hadlo.
That doesn't matter.	Taasi waxba maaha.
I do not have.	ma hayo.
He could not believe it.	Aad ayuu u rumaysan waayay.
And me.	Iyo aniga.
I do not do that.	Taas ma sameeyo.
He could not do enough.	Wax ku filan ayuu u qaban waayay.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko.
I'm glad that what happened, happened.	Waan ku faraxsanahay in waxa dhacay, dhacay.
Not this.	Ma aha tan.
It is not interesting.	Ma ahan mid xiiso leh.
Lots of little things.	Waxyaabo badan oo yar.
He refused to cooperate.	Wuu diiday inuu la shaqeeyo.
I do not want to leave.	Ma rabo inaan baxo.
Not sure how this works.	Ma hubo sida tan loo shaqeeyo.
I am the one who loves.	Waxaan ahay kan jecel.
You will go home soon.	Waxaad aadi doontaa guriga dhawaan.
It's amazing !.	Waa yaab!.
The same was true.	Isla sidii uu ahaa.
I think so.	Waxaan qabaa taas.
I got enough.	Waxaan helay ku filan.
I am very skeptical of the latter.	Waxaan aad uga shakisanahay kan dambe.
This is difficult.	Tani waa mid adag.
But this will be fine.	Laakiin tani way fiicnaan doontaa.
That will take some time.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti yar.
Weli.	Weli.
I really am for him.	Runtii isaga ayaan u ahay.
Door to door.	Albaabka albaabka.
He had nothing to do with being there.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn inuu halkaas joogo.
Mostly it is true.	Inta badan waa run.
It does, and it certainly does.	Wuu sameeyaa, oo hubaal wuu jiraa.
They are what they are and will continue to be.	Waxay yihiin waxay yihiin oo sii ahaan doonaan.
All is still here	Dhammaan wali waa halkan
I never did.	Weligay ma samayn.
I wish he could help me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu i caawin karo.
Luckily they need me.	Waxa nasiib u leh inay ii baahan yihiin.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
But she did not get it.	Laakiin ma aysan helin.
If he did.	Haddii uu sameeyay.
But he really did.	Laakiin runtii wuu sameeyay.
I don't have a lover.	Ma haysto mid isaga jecel.
But for me, how good you look.	Laakiin aniga, sida wanaagsan ee aad u egtahay.
No one is there.	Qofna meesha ma joogo.
He thought we were friends.	Wuxuu mooday inaan saaxiibo nahay.
It is the only thing to do.	Waa waxa kaliya ee lagu sameeyo.
Absolutely!	Dhab ahaantii!
Good day	Maalin wanaagsan
Stop	Jooji
You have a mind.	Maan baad leedahay.
As you said, that is how things are.	Sida aad sheegtay, waa sida ay wax yihiin.
They just.	Waxay kaliya .
I was ready	diyaar baan ahaa
I didn’t think enough was enough.	Uma malaynayn in ku filan.
I left quickly.	Degdeg ayaan u baxay.
But he felt it.	Laakiin wuu dareemay.
You will be home soon.	Waxaad noqon doontaa guriga dhawaan.
He was a great man, everywhere.	Wuxuu ahaa nin weyn, meel walba.
It will tell you it is true.	Waxay kuu sheegi doontaa inay run tahay.
There is just nothing interesting.	Kaliya wax xiiso leh ma jiraan.
It will do the same for you.	Waxay kuu samayn doontaa sidaas oo kale.
We did not think we were close friends.	Uma malaynayn inaan nahay saaxiibo dhow.
We will discuss it again.	Dib ayaan u wada hadli doonaa.
I'm sorry.	waan kaa xumahay.
They love him very much.	Aad bay u jecel yihiin isaga.
I’ve seen it here, here and here.	Waxaan ku arkay halkan, halkan iyo halkan.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha.
Nothing better, for sure.	Waxba ka fiican, hubaal.
I do not want to talk about this.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo arrintan.
That has to be done.	Taasi waa in la sameeyaa.
I have to do this.	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa.
They must be very good.	Waa inay aad u wanaagsan yihiin.
I know you are.	Waan ogahay inaad tahay.
I will do the same.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa sidaas oo kale.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
.	.
I did not know if I was hoping or not.	Maan garanayn inaan rajaynayo iyo in kale.
This is not surprising.	Tani ma aha wax la yaab leh.
He tried to work on it.	Waxa uu isku dayay in uu ka shaqeeyo.
Do not pay.	Waxba ha bixin.
Very good at best.	Mid aad u fiican ugu fiican.
It doesn't come out much.	Wax badan kama soo baxo.
Got it, got it.	Helay, helay.
Every time.	Mar kasta.
What has happened in the past is a thing of the past.	Wixii hore u dhacay waa hore.
Everyone else is missing.	Qof kasta oo kale waa la waayay.
That did not come true.	Taasi run uma helin.
No one will see us.	Qofna na arki maayo.
So far you have not.	Ilaa hadda ma aadan haysan.
That was what he needed.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu u baahan yahay.
This surprises me.	Tani waa iga yaab.
I didn't have time.	Waqti uma helin.
You did not get a job	Ma aadan helin shaqo
He is just a man.	Waa nin kaliya.
It looks great, whatever it is, and it goes fast.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn, wax kasta oo ay tahay, oo si degdeg ah u socda.
I got it that way.	Waxaan helay sidaas oo kale.
It cannot be done consistently.	Lama samayn karo si joogto ah.
If a man.	Haddii nin.
He will believe that.	Wuu rumaysan doonaa taas.
He left early.	Goor hore ayuu shaqada ka tagay.
He was really one of us.	Runtii wuu naga mid ahaa.
I hope to see you soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan ku arko.
I think he will be able to do it again.	Waxaan filayaa inuu mar kale awoodi doono.
It is also a lot of work.	Sidoo kale waa shaqo aad u badan.
Maybe it's good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wanaagsan tahay.
It was about three.	Waxay ahayd ilaa saddex.
It is much more difficult than that.	Aad bay uga dhib badan tahay taas.
What a problem.	Waa maxay wax dhib ah.
Tell me what you think and why.	Ii sheeg waxa ay adiga kula tahay iyo sababta.
For the most part, this was true.	Inta badan, tani run bay ahayd.
Now I got that.	Hadda waan helay taas.
No wonder they are friends.	La yaab maaha inay saaxiibo yihiin.
you are right	sax baad tahay
But no one knew what to do with it.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayn waxa lagu sameeyo.
Including.	Oo ay ku jiraan.
I will do everything for one.	Wax walba waxaan u sameyn doonaa hal mid.
He loves it.	Wuu jecel yahay.
I really had to learn how to do that.	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan barto sida loo sameeyo taas.
This is really amazing.	Runtii tani waa yaab.
For a long time.	Muddo dheer.
But, it really is not.	Laakiin, run ahaantii maaha.
I knew what he liked.	Waan ogaa waxa uu jecel yahay.
Where it is good that they are close.	Halka ay ku fiican tahay inay isku dhow yihiin.
It doesn't look familiar.	Uma eka mid la yaqaan.
After all, this is a one-time event.	Had iyo jeer, tani waa hal mar.
He told me.	Ayuu ii sheegay.
Not that he ever did.	Ma aha in uu waligiis sameeyay.
I really went to school.	Runtii waxaan aaday dugsiga.
I was really lucky.	Runtii waxaan lahaa xoogaa nasiib ah.
As we are.	Sida aan nahay.
You will get it tomorrow.	Waxaad heli doontaa berrito.
But I will talk.	Laakiin waan wada hadli doonaa.
I do not understand why it is not.	Ma fahmin sababta aysan u ahayn.
But there was no time for that.	Laakiin ma jirin waqti taas.
He’s alive, he’s even better.	Waa nool yahay, xitaa wuu fiican yahay.
One year ago today.	Hal sano ka hor maanta.
I just picked it up and tried it.	Kaliya waan soo qaaday oo isku dayay.
This was not like me.	Tani ma ahayn aniga oo kale.
I think everyone knows that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba ogyahay taas.
But that is a good thing.	Laakiin taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
Is this correct?	Tani ma sax baa?.
We were good friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo wanaagsan.
That may be only the smallest.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa oo kaliya inta ugu yar.
She is probably there now.	Waxay u badan tahay inay halkaas joogto hadda.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
Interesting.	Xiiso leh.
Today, that is.	Maanta, taasi waa.
I got it from someone else.	Waxaan ka helay qof kale.
Why is this so?	Maxay tani sidaas u tahay?
I tried to be.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan noqdo.
It is difficult to make money.	Way adag tahay in lacag la sameeyo.
No one knows what to do.	Qofna ma garanayo wuxuu sameeyo.
I need to do this for myself.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan aniga ii sameeyo.
Now she is not doing that.	Hadda ma samaynayso sidaas.
This is when it is at its best.	Tani waa marka ay ugu fiican tahay.
It’s not too much of a big deal.	Ma aha wax aad u badan shaqo weyn oo weyn.
There was so much more to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo kale oo la samayn lahaa.
I don't even know what that was.	Xitaa ma garanayo waxa ay taasi ahayd.
Very good, don't you think ?.	Aad u fiican, miyaadan u malaynayn?.
Then he came back, again and again.	Ka dib wuu soo noqday, mar kale iyo mar kale.
But only for a while.	Laakiin kaliya muddo ah.
I know she did it for me.	Waan ogahay inay ii samaysay.
Maybe you should.	Malaha waa inaad.
Surprising, but true.	Yaab, laakiin run.
But it still wouldn't be.	Laakiin weli ma ay ahaan lahayd.
Now, he knew.	Hadda, wuu ogaa.
He is definitely the person at work.	Dhab ahaantii waa qofka shaqada.
I have no problem.	Dhib ma hayo.
Not good.	Wax wanaagsan maaha.
I want to leave here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ka baxo
This needs to be addressed.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay in laga hadlo.
Now that is amazing.	Hadda taasi waa yaab.
I was just a friend.	Waxaan ahaa kaliya saaxiib.
Good for home and school.	Ku fiican guriga iyo dugsiga.
You are.	Waxaad tahay.
He lied.	Been buu sheegay.
You need something solid	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax adag
Maybe no one can help you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qofna uusan ku caawin karin.
It is abandoned.	Waa laga tagay.
I wish it would be different.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay si kale ahaan lahayd.
I know he will do great things.	Waan ogahay inuu wax weyn qaban doono.
I would get it	waan heli lahaa
But you will come back.	Laakiin waad soo noqon doontaa.
I always had something to say.	Mar walba waxaan lahaa wax aan u sheego.
So too.	Sidoo kale sidoo kale.
Only one bad day.	Kaliya hal maalin xun.
It could not be so much a lie.	Ma noqon karin been sidaas u badan.
I will not do that.	Taas ma samaynayo.
She was told she was one of them.	Waxa loo sheegay in ay ka mid tahay.
Not sure what else to do here.	Ma hubo waxa kale oo la sameeyo halkan.
That is true so far.	Taasi waa run ilaa hadda.
Maybe this is it ?.	Ma laga yaabaa inay tani tahay?.
Often it should not be correct.	Inta badan waa in aanay sax ahayn.
He was out of luck.	Nasiib buu ka baxay.
.	.
He will do so today.	Sidaas ayaa yeeli doona maanta.
This is not difficult.	Tani ma aha mid adag.
Not people like me.	Ma aha dadka aniga oo kale ah.
It didn't do anything, it just seemed like a long time ago.	Waxba ma samayn, wax u muuqday waqti dheer.
It’s all person to person.	Dhammaan waa qof ilaa qof.
You don't need anything else.	Wax kale uma baahnid.
Very well.	Si aad u wanaagsan.
I have no money.	Lacag ma haysto.
It's like this.	Waa sida tan.
In fact, it is a huge problem.	Dhab ahaantii, waa dhibaato aad u weyn.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
No one came out.	Qofna ma soo bixin.
How can that be?	Sidee taasi noqon kartaa?
Tell me more now.	Hadda wax badan ii sheeg.
I know they do.	Waan ogahay inay sameeyaan.
I have never found one.	Weligay mid maan helin.
I desperately need it.	Aad ayaan ugu baahanahay.
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
I knew they would not do it.	Waan ogaa inaysan yeeli doonin.
I hope that will be seen.	Waxaan filayaa in taas la arki doono.
More, you can say.	Wax badan, waxaad odhan kartaa.
I know you have.	Waan ogahay inaad leedahay.
Something would happen tomorrow.	Wax baa dhici lahaa berri.
If you do, this is for you.	Haddii aad sameyso, tani waa adiga.
He seemed too hard on that.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad ugu adag taas.
There is nothing exciting here, he said.	Ma jiraan wax xiiso leh halkan, ayuu yidhi.
I'm not sure if this is good or bad.	Ma hubo inay taasi fiican tahay iyo inay xun tahay.
I wonder who thought so.	Yaab yaa sidaas mooday.
A lot of them.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah.
I saw	waan arkay
But it also needs to be negative.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay u baahan tahay si xun.
No wonder, maybe.	La yaab maaha, malaha.
I will not lie.	Been sheegi maayo.
He said it would take a lot of time.	Wuxuu sheegay inay qaadan doonto waqti aad u badan.
Like, everyone knows that.	Sida, qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
There is something great that needs to be done.	Waxaa jira wax weyn oo u baahan in la sameeyo.
But here, here was something.	Laakiin halkan, halkan waxaa jiray wax.
There was no such thing here.	Ma jirin wax la mid ah halkan.
I have no idea how to do this.	Ma hayo wax fikrad ah sida tan loo sameeyo.
Everything is correct.	Wax walba sax.
It is clear wisdom.	Waa caqli cad.
It is the best !.	Waa kan ugu fiican!.
There is no such thing.	Ma jiraan wax la mid ah.
You will see.	Waad arki doontaa.
All in all, me.	Dhammaan, aniga oo dhan.
She was right.	Run bay sheegtay.
Who knew, maybe she did.	Yaa ogaa, malaha way samaysay.
He seemed happy.	Wax buu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan.
She said that could not be true.	Waxay sheegtay inaysan taasi run noqon karin.
I '.	I'.
I love it now	Hadda waan jeclahay
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
You can't imagine.	Ma malayn kartid.
Maybe she did it differently.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay si kale samaysay.
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
It was great to be present.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in la joogo.
I'm scared.	Waa iga baqayaa.
Now I am very serious.	Hadda aad ayaan uga dhab ahay.
She told me to stop.	Waxay igu tidhi jooji.
He has not yet left	Wali ma bixin
I love everyone.	Waan jeclahay qof walba.
There is no way they can not.	Ma jirto si aysan u awoodin.
It was nothing new.	Wax cusub ma ahayn.
It is long and beautiful.	Waa dheer oo qurux badan.
Give three more.	Saddex kale sii.
Something has to be done.	Waa in wax la sameeyaa.
Maybe she even has a boyfriend.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xitaa leedahay saaxiib.
I know it is not.	Waan ogahay in aanay ahayn.
But if they did, that would be great.	Laakiin haddii ay sameeyaan, taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
That is how it can happen.	Taasi waa sida ay u dhici karto.
That is true.	Taas oo run ah.
I don't know if it will happen.	Ma garanayo haddii ay dhici doonto.
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
You had a good idea there a few years later.	Waxaad fikrad fiican ku lahayd halkaas dhowr sano ka dib.
There is no more.	Ma jiro mid dambe.
Nothing big here.	Wax weyn maaha halkan.
He is not a good person.	Ma ahan qof wanaagsan.
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
Everyone needs good friends.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u baahan yahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
I am nothing.	Aniga waxba maaha.
Take it.	Qaado.
That is the place of opportunity.	Taasi waa meesha fursad.
How money was earned.	Sida lacag la helay.
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
I can't talk for long.	Ma hadli karo waqti dheer.
She really did.	Run ahaantii way samaysay.
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
I would expect that.	Taas ayaan filan lahaa.
For the most part this was not a problem.	Inta badan tani dhibaato ma ahayn.
You said so.	Adiga ayaa sidaas sheegtay.
I can't even afford it.	Xitaa ma awoodo.
No one is really sure how much can be believed.	Qofna si dhab ah uma hubo inta la rumaysan karo.
No one gave this.	Qofna ma siin tan.
Can you help?	Ma caawin kartaa?.
She's smart, too.	Way caqli badan tahay, sidoo kale.
This would be nice.	Tani way fiicnaan lahayd.
I am the one he needs.	Waxaan ahay kan uu u baahan yahay.
But there was nothing she could do.	Laakiin ma jirin wax ay samayn karto.
But it was the same everywhere.	Laakiin meel walba isku mid bay ahayd.
I can talk to anyone about anything.	Qofna waan kala hadli karaa wax kasta.
I do not want to talk to you.	Ma rabo inaan kula hadlo.
She might like that.	Way jeclaan kartaa taas.
What a beautiful day.	Waa maxay maalin qurux badan.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
I got the same money.	Waxaan helay lacag la mid ah.
There is still more to do.	Weli waxaa jira wax ka badan oo la sameeyo.
It cannot be stopped.	Ma aha mid la joojin karo.
It is something that is not.	Waa wax aan ahayn.
I had a really good time.	Waxaan lahaa waqti aad u fiican runtii.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
And you need something similar.	Oo waxaad u baahan tahay wax la mid ah.
It was just one, you might say.	Waxay ahayd hal kaliya, waxaad odhan kartaa.
I can't find him now.	Hadda ma heli karo isaga.
Not always.	Mar kasta maaha.
Great man.	Nin weyn.
I saw that.	Waan arkay taas.
You can say it again, and again.	Waxaad odhan kartaa mar kale, iyo mar kale.
I had a good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
This was so.	Tani waxay ahayd sidaas.
I was so impressed !.	Aad baan ula dhacay!.
But I did not give anything.	Laakiin waxba ma siin.
I expect that to be done.	Waxaan filayaa in taas la sameeyo.
It will only take time.	Kaliya waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
Hard work was what he needed now.	Shaqada adag waxay ahayd waxa uu hadda u baahan yahay.
The reason was good.	Sababta ayaa ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I doubt something will come out of it.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay wax ka soo bixi doonaan.
Obviously this is still not true.	Sida iska cad tani wali run maaha.
Something has to be done once.	Wax ay tahay in hal mar la sameeyo.
You know you want one.	Waad ogtahay inaad mid rabto.
But he never said much.	Laakiin waligiis wax badan ma odhan.
I can believe it	Waan rumaysan karaa
But there may be more.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa in ay jiraan wax ka badan.
No problems were reported	Wax dhibaato ah lama soo sheegin
He was still in prison.	Weli xabsiga ayuu ku jiray.
This cannot be.	Tani ma noqon karto.
A beautiful one came into the room.	Qurux badan ayaa qolka soo galay.
I wouldn’t let him.	Uma ogolaan lahaa isaga.
I couldn't stop.	Waan joojin waayay.
It is big and beautiful.	Waa weyn oo qurux badan.
I know you are doing your best.	Waan ogahay inaad samaynayso waxa ugu fiican.
I have a problem here.	halkaan dhibaato ayaan ku qabaa.
It's the same again.	Waa sidaas oo kale mar kale.
He really tried.	Runtii wuu isku dayay.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Wax halkan ma jirin, waxba.
I knew you would come back.	Waan ogaa inaad soo noqon doonto.
Until recently.	Ilaa dhawaan.
There is a new one.	Mid cusub ayaa jira.
This is not allowed.	Tan lama ogolaan karin.
I will tell you now.	Hadda waan kuu sheegi doonaa.
I know what I do.	Waan ogahay waxaan sameeyo.
It is very beautiful.	Aad ayuu u qurux badan yahay.
He tried, but he would already be here.	Wuu isku dayay, laakiin mar hore ayuu halkan joogi lahaa.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
Stop now!	Hadda jooji!
That is not common here.	Taasi halkan uma badna.
Everyone knows how to do this.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa sida tan loo sameeyo.
I can't do this.	Ma samayn karo tan.
We will do this.	Waanu samayn doonaa tan.
This could be.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa.
One man has a better chance.	Hal nin ayaa ka fursad wanaagsan.
For sure.	Waxa hubaal ah.
Don't do that again.	Mar dambe taas ha samayn.
I do not understand what happened tonight.	Ma fahmin wax caawa dhacay.
Everyone wants what they want.	Qof kasta waxa uu rabo.
But today, they will be.	Laakiin maanta, waxay ahaan doonaan.
It will help you.	Way ku caawin doontaa.
There is.	Waxaa jira.
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
One was true.	Mid run bay ahayd.
What, it is.	Waa maxay, waa.
He did not say where.	Meesha ma uu sheegin.
No one has come home yet.	Qofna weli ma iman guriga.
What an amazing man.	Waa maxay nin la yaab leh.
She did not know.	Ma ay garanayn.
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I think we will.	Waxaan filayaa inaan sameyn doono.
But no one wanted to.	Laakiin qofna ma rabin.
I did something	wax baan sameeyay
Absolutely not.	Dhab ahaantii ma jirto.
Just a friend at home.	Kaliya saaxiib guriga.
There was something new.	Wax cusub baa jiray.
He knows how to do it, a lot of things.	Wuu yaqaan sida loo sameeyo, waxyaabo badan.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
There may be nothing here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan waxba halkan ku jirin.
In fact, it was.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma hayo.
No one can leave.	Qofna ma bixi karo.
She could not believe what had just happened.	Way rumaysan wayday waxa hadda dhacay.
I always do.	Mar walba waan sameeyaa.
It will be difficult in the long run.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid adag muddo dheer.
That could be.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa.
That should not be there.	Taasi waa inaysan halkaas joogin.
Both are everywhere.	Labaduba meel walba way ka jiraan.
It really is the only one.	Dhab ahaantii waa ka kaliya.
You need it now.	Waxaad u baahan tahay hadda.
You do not have to do anything.	Ma aha inaad wax samayso.
It was not very interesting.	Ma ahayn mid aad u xiiso badan.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
There is just something else.	Kaliya wax kale ayaa jira.
I haven’t been here in a long time really.	Ma aan joogin muddo dheer runtii.
It is not clear what happened to him.	Lama hubo waxa ku dhacay.
You can stay there as long as you need to.	Waxaad joogi kartaa halkaas ilaa inta aad u baahan tahay.
I could not tell.	Ma sheegi karin.
I knew it would get better.	Waan ogaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma joogo.
Have a good time.	Waqti fiican qaado.
She said she was.	Waxay sheegtay inay ahayd.
I am here to help	Waxaan halkaan u joogaa inaan caawiyo
He wanted you.	Wuu ku rabay.
he knows how.	wuu garanayaa sida.
I don't know, anything else.	Ma garanayo, wax kale.
It was so.	Sidaas bay ahayd.
I put it.	Waan dhigay.
No one knows anything.	Qofna waxba ma yaqaan.
That was what he did.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa sameeyay.
This was bad.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xun.
She needs money.	Waxay u baahan tahay lacag.
Enough to eat.	Ku filan in la cuno.
They are very small.	Aad bay u yar yihiin.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
He is back.	Wuu soo noqday.
I don't think anyone will do that.	U malayn maayo in qofna sidaas yeeli doono.
It's too bad now.	Hadda aad bay u xun tahay.
We would not do it.	Ma yeeli lahayn.
There are three problems here.	Waxaa jira saddex dhibaato halkan.
This cannot happen again.	Tani mar kale ma dhici karto.
I will not see you tonight.	caawa kuma arki doono.
Here, there, and everywhere.	Halkan, halkaas, iyo meel kasta.
I had a lot to work with.	Waxaan lahaa wax badan oo aan la shaqeeyo.
We were given a small amount of money.	Waxa nala siiyay lacag yar.
You do not need to tell anyone.	Uma baahnid inaad qofna u sheegto.
No one can say.	Qofna ma sheegi karo.
Something very familiar, but it is old.	Wax aad loo yaqaan, laakiin waa hore.
She said I'm sorry.	Waxay tidhi waan ka xumahay.
I have seen something similar before.	Wax la mid ah hadda ka hor ayaan arkay.
I thought this might be just a little bit.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay noqon karto oo kaliya mid yar.
And returned.	Oo soo noqday.
Just don't go.	Kaliya ha tagin.
He must leave us.	Waa inuu naga tago.
Only one more.	Kaliya hal kale.
That is a terrible thing.	Taasi waa wax aad u xun.
It can be anyone.	Wuxuu noqon karaa qof kasta.
That is enough, he said.	Taasi waa ku filan ayaa sheegay.
He is still there.	Weli wuu joogaa.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
You know, it's not a bad idea.	Waad ogtahay, maaha fikrad xun.
But it has not yet been done.	Laakiin weli lama samayn.
It will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doono.
I will definitely stay again.	Waa hubaal inaan mar kale sii joogi doono.
And also, that there is another.	Iyo sidoo kale, in uu jiro mid kale.
Someone was at home.	Qof ayaa guriga joogay.
I'm not even sure.	Xitaa ma hubo.
They are the same as everyone else.	Waxay la mid yihiin dadka kale.
It is very small.	Waa mid aad u yar.
There was nothing he could see that he did not like.	Ma jirin wax uu arki karo oo aanu jeclayn.
I got one.	Waxaan helay mid.
If you have one, that is it.	Haddii aad mid leedahay, taasi waa.
Maybe I can also make money.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale lacag ku helo.
Someone like that.	Qof sidaas oo kale ah.
But he was ready for me.	Laakiin diyaar buu ii ahaa.
I just did.	Kaliya waan sameeyay.
It has great beauty.	Waxay leedahay qurux weyn.
But he did not do the same.	Laakiin ma uusan samayn wax la mid ah.
How well they live.	Sida wanaagsan ay u nool yihiin.
We can not fall !.	Ma dhici karno!.
We will take all you can get.	Waxaan qaadan doonaa dhammaan waxaad heli karto.
Not sure much else.	Ma hubo in wax badan oo kale.
Much has been said about it.	Wax badan baa laga sheegay.
Just said.	Kaliya ayaa sheegay.
I would be	Waxaan ahaan lahaa
I knew everything.	Wax walba waan ogaa.
Now they do everything together.	Hadda wax walba way wada sameeyaan.
That is not surprising.	Taasi la yaab maaha.
No one comes out.	Qofna ma soo baxo.
I will come out.	Waan soo bixi doonaa.
I have no idea if she wants to.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo haddii ay rabto.
This is great.	Tani waa mid weyn.
But it is difficult for him to stay with us.	Laakiin way ku adag tahay inuu nala joogo.
we will see.	waan arki doonaa.
But now he, too, would get a chance.	Laakiin hadda isaga, sidoo kale, wuu heli lahaa fursad.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
He tried again.	Mar kale ayuu isku dayay.
This is a beautiful place.	Tani waa meel qurux badan.
He didn't bother me.	Dhib ima uu siin.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
You need a little more.	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax yar.
I think it was just me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aniga kaliya ahayd.
I can talk	waan hadli karaa
He could not say why he thought so.	Wuu sheegi waayay sababta uu sidaas ugu maleeyay.
You had a bad day.	Maalin xun baad ahayd.
Something happened to what happened.	Wax baa ka dhacay wixii dhacay.
He is a tough guy.	Waa qof adag.
So he said.	Sidaas ayuu yidhi.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
Maybe he was.	Malaha wuxuu ahaa.
Also	Sidoo kale
Too much, too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay, aad bay u badan tahay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
It had nothing to do with it.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn.
I haven’t done this again until recently	Mar dambe tan ma samayn ilaa dhawaan
I am not here to befriend anyone.	Halkan uma ihi inaan cidna la saaxiibo.
This works better.	Tani shaqada ka fiican.
None too bad.	Ma jiro mid aad u xun.
She has many friends.	Waxay leedahay saaxiibo badan.
I still found it here and there.	Weli waxaan ka helay halkan iyo halkaas.
I do not know where to go now.	Meel aan aado hadda maan garanayn.
This is really bad.	Runtii tani waa mid xun.
It was this.	Waxay ahayd tan.
I am nothing now.	Hadda waxba ma ihi.
I am there.	Waxaan ahay halkaas.
I wanted something to eat.	Waxaan rabay wax aan cuno.
I told him a lot.	Wax badan ayaan u sheegay.
I think for a while.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in muddo ah.
I had to say that.	Waxay ahayd inaan taas sheego.
I knew what she would do.	Waan ogaa waxay samayn doonto.
We really are.	Runtii waan nahay.
That was everything.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax walba.
As it were for me.	Sidii ay aniga ahaan lahayd.
He wanted what he wanted.	Waxa uu rabay ayuu rabay.
would like to.	jeclaan lahaa inaan.
Let him see.	Ha arko.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
Well done.	Si fiican loo sameeyay.
He was in a good mood.	Niyad wanaagsan buu ku jiray.
I wanted to go there as well.	Waxaan rabay inaan aado halkaas sidoo kale.
It would be over.	Way dhammaan lahayd.
But the reason for this is obvious.	Laakiin sababta tani waa cad.
I got it, too.	Waan helay, sidoo kale.
He tried to see.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu arko.
She said she had no money.	Waxa ay sheegtay in aanay wax lacag ah haysan.
Mary must be hard on you.	Maryan waa inay kugu adag tahay.
I hope you have a great time.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad waqti fiican qaadan doonto.
I can leave	Waan bixi karaa
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
Good, you.	Wanaagsan, adiga.
I think it is really beautiful.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay runtii qurux badan tahay.
I'm sure you will agree.	Waan hubaa inaad ogolaan doonto.
you love me so much.	aad ii jecel.
That is what should be discussed.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay in laga hadlo.
She is still very happy.	Weli aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
She would do it.	Way samayn lahayd.
Something seemed unknown.	Wax ayaa u muuqday mid aan la ogeyn.
More than once, even.	In ka badan hal mar, xitaa.
It was a lot of money.	Waxay ahayd lacag aad u badan.
Didn't you tell him.	Miyaadan u sheegin.
That is known.	Taas ayaa lagu yaqaan.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
It's not a big deal for me.	Wax weyn maaha aniga.
She said in surprise.	Yaab bay tidhi.
Only good tonight.	Kaliya u fiican caawa.
Hard place.	Meel adag.
While it is certain that each received a little.	Halka ay hubaal tahay in mid walba uu helay wax yar.
Also, the best.	Sidoo kale, ugu fiican.
But they are good.	Laakiin way wanaagsan yihiin.
But, here it is.	Laakiin, waa kan.
He went there.	Halkaas ayuu u baxay.
You did well.	Si fiican baad u samaysay.
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
It was so much fun, so much fun.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan, aad u xiiso badan.
It can be clearly seen.	Si cad ayaa loo arki karaa.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
It's very, very bad.	Aad iyo aad bay u xun tahay.
No one had it.	Qofna ma haysan.
He had that.	Taas buu lahaa.
At first he said nothing.	Markii hore waxba ma uu odhan.
It is a good thing that she is here.	Waa wax wanaagsan oo wanaagsan inay halkan joogto.
You can stay with us tonight.	Waad nala joogi kartaa caawa.
No one else will help you.	Ma jiro qof kale oo ku caawin doona.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
That's right.	Waa sax.
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
If you will find me that is.	Haddii aad i heli doonto taasi waa.
I can't agree	Ma ogolaan karo
He had to do a lot.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax badan sameeyo.
One is driving.	Mid ka mid ah ayaa wada baabuur.
That was a very difficult job.	Taasi waxay ahayd shaqo aad u adag.
They did not have time.	Waqti uma ay helin.
But one person came in.	Laakiin hal qof ayaa soo galay.
I don't have a hard time at school.	Waqti adag kuma haysto dugsiga.
This is more interesting than it sounds.	Tani waa ka xiiso badan inta ay u egtahay.
It just doesn’t look good.	Kaliya uma eka mid wanaagsan.
It's a lot.	Waa wax aad u badan.
It was a very bad time for me.	Waxay ii ahayd wakhti aad u xun.
I want more	wax badan ayaan rabaa
There is no living thing.	Wax nool ma jiro.
I can't go back.	Ma noqon karo dib.
He was there once.	Hal mar ayuu meesha joogay.
He knows what he is doing.	Wuu garanayaa waxa uu samaynayo.
Very, very well done.	Aad iyo aad u wanaagsan ayaa la sameeyay.
I had to tell her.	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego.
And now me.	Oo hadda aniga.
Him! 	Isaga!
he said.	ayuu yiri.
That was the main thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ugu weyn.
The day before.	Maalin ka hor.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
A new man.	Nin cusub.
Now I have decided.	Hadda ayaan go'aansaday.
I think you can help me, you can even get him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad i caawin karto, xitaa waad heli kartaa isaga.
If there is anything, I will get it.	Haddii ay wax jiraan, waan heli doonaa.
Not only that.	Kaliya ma jirto.
I will go somewhere else.	Meel kale ayaan aadi doonaa.
There was little we could do about it now.	Waxaa jiray wax yar oo aan hadda ka qaban karno taas.
It is still true.	Wali waa run.
I know where he went.	Waan ogahay meesha uu aaday.
That includes me.	Taas waxaa ku jira aniga.
I know it's true.	Waan ogahay inay run tahay.
As always.	Sida si joogto ah.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Qofna ma rabin inuu mar dambe ila hadlo.
I was really surprised.	Runtii waan yaabay.
They did not go.	Ma ay tagin.
That may not be the case.	Taasi waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
They are great.	Way weyn yihiin.
He knew where he was.	Wuu ogaa meesha uu joogo.
I have a great time for you.	waqti weyn baan kugu leeyahay.
He did well.	Si fiican ayuu sameeyay.
Small and large.	Yar iyo weyn.
I will be going home soon.	Waxaan aadi doonaa guriga dhawaan.
First, they have not done anything yet.	Marka hore, weli waxba ma ay qaban.
Now more than ever.	Hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
It is not a car.	Ma aha baabuur.
Both will do a great job.	Labaduba waxay qaban doonaan shaqo weyn.
At one point he disappeared.	Hal mar waa la waayay.
He doesn’t seem to have had many friends, really.	Uma eka inuu lahaa saaxiibo badan, dhab ahaantii.
I looked the other day.	Waxaan eegay maalin kale.
Anything else.	Wax kale.
Both are beautiful.	Labaduba waa qurux badan yihiin.
He never wanted anything so bad.	Waligiis ma uusan rabin wax sidaas u xun.
I should not.	Ma ahayn inaan.
I'm not sure she can take it.	Ma hubo inay qaadan karto.
I do not believe.	Maan rumaysan.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
Not here, obviously.	Ma aha halkan, cad.
Everyone has a bad time.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay waqti aad u xun.
I'm sure they won't.	Waxaan hubaa inaysan u ogolaan doonin.
I just need to talk to someone.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof la hadlo.
I entered with him.	Waan la galay.
I just do not know what to do.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
I thought she was doing everything.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay wax walba samaynayso.
Everyone knows me there.	Qof kastaa wuu igu garanayaa halkaas.
It was all.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd.
He got what he wanted.	Waxa uu rabay ayuu helay.
It really is.	Runtii waa.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
He must have heard.	Waa inuu maqlay.
In fact, you can do it now.	Dhab ahaantii, waad sameyn kartaa hadda.
I did nothing else.	Wax kale maan samayn.
In that, too.	In taas, sidoo kale.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
he could not stop.	wuu joojin waayay.
Nothing else.	Wax kale maaha.
Maybe it would happen.	Malaha way dhici lahayd.
I did not want to know if he could do that or not.	Maan rabin inaan ogaado inuu taas samayn karo iyo in kale.
It can stop, for sure.	Way joojin kartaa, hubaal.
You know you have a day.	Waad ogtahay inaad maalin leedahay.
I need to do another one.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo mid kale.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
Indeed, he was.	Runtii, wuxuu ahaa.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
I am very busy	mashquul aad ayaan u ahay
He was so beautiful nearby.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad uga qurux badan meel u dhow.
A little, nothing more.	Wax yar, wax kale maaha.
This is good.	Tani way fiican tahay.
I am very, very happy.	Aad iyo aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
But she did not really want that.	Laakiin runtii taas ma ay rabin.
Obviously you will need to do more.	Sida cad waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad wax badan samayso.
This was not a coincidence	Tani ma ahayn wax iska dhacay
Do not let anyone.	Cidna ha u ogolaan.
I didn't like it very much.	Aad uma jeclayn.
Who put it there?	Yaa meesha dhigay?
He left quickly.	Degdeg ayuu uga baxay.
I would do it	waan qaban lahaa
I do not know what to do with it.	Ma garanayo waxaan ku sameeyo.
You would leave me.	Waad iga tagi lahayd.
I am not exactly here.	Si sax ah halkan uma joogo.
Did he think he could get away with that.	Ma wuxuu mooday inuu taas ka bixi karo.
something strange happened.	wax la yaab leh ayaa dhacay.
Really nice thing to say.	Runtii wax aad u qurux badan in la sheego.
This must be done in advance.	Tani waa in la sameeyaa ka hor.
And what it contains.	Iyo waxa ku jira.
You know there is still another problem.	Waad ogtahay inay weli dhibaato kale jirto.
But she did not do it.	Laakiin way yeeli wayday.
He could not tell me what he found.	Ma ii sheegi waayay waxa uu helay.
And now this.	Oo hadda kan.
You are great.	Waad weyn tahay.
He promised to help.	Wuxuu ballan qaaday inuu caawin doono.
I just tried to help.	Waxaan isku dayay kaliya inaan caawiyo.
But it was still to be done.	Laakiin wali waxay ahayd hubaal in la sameeyo.
That is very good.	Taasi waa mid aad u fiican.
He told no one.	Cidna waxba uma uu sheegin.
He would rather be another man.	Wuxuu ka jeclaan lahaa inuu noqdo nin kale.
I'm sure it will come out.	Waan hubaa inuu soo bixi doono.
You can not do it at home.	Guriga kuma samayn kartid.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
Correctly correct.	Si sax ah u sax.
So far, no one can.	Ilaa hadda, qofna ma awoodo.
She did not think it was enough.	Waxay u malayn wayday inay ku filan tahay.
It should also be.	Sidoo kale waa in.
If that is what you want.	Haddii taasi tahay waxa aad rabto.
No one else was seen.	Ma jirin qof kale oo la arkay.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
I wonder how that was.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay taasi ahayd.
Something happened, something new.	Wax baa dhacay, wax cusub.
He may also be here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale halkan joogo.
Someone was at the door.	Qof baa albaabka joogay.
That you are a smart person.	In aad tahay qof caqli badan.
I withdrew	Waan ka noqday
I decided to go there.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan halkaas tago.
We cannot say whether it is true or false.	Ma sheegi karno inay run tahay iyo inay been tahay.
I wish someone would do something like this to me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in nin ii sameeyo wax sidaas oo kale ah.
It will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doono.
They really need it, after all.	Runtii way u baahan yihiin, ka dib oo dhan.
There is nothing here	Halkan waxba ma jiraan
This is not a good thing.	Tani maaha wax wanaagsan.
It's hard work.	Waa shaqo adag.
Everyone wants a real job.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa shaqo dhab ah.
He is in a good place.	Meel fiican ayuu joogaa.
Everyone is fine with me.	Qof kasta wuu ila fiican yahay.
He felt like a big man.	Wuxuu dareemay sidii nin weyn oo kale.
I refused to do it.	Waan diiday inaan sameeyo.
I hope this will help someone.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay caawin doonto qof.
Unfold afterwards, not earlier.	Kala bixi ka dib, hore ma aha.
I really do.	Waxaan si dhab ah u sameeyaa.
But this is also obvious.	Laakiin tani sidoo kale waa mid iska cad.
I just can't get this.	Kaliya tan ma heli karo.
Really, really good stuff.	Runtii, runtii waxyaabo fiican.
I did it early today.	Waxaan sameeyay goor hore maanta.
You don't want to be anywhere near there tonight.	Ma rabto in aad meel u dhow halkaas caawa.
A true friend.	Saaxiib run ah.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
I was really lucky.	Runtii nasiib ayaan lahaa.
He knew he was close.	Wuu ogaa inuu u dhow yahay.
Sometimes there were up to three of them.	Mar mar waxa joogay ilaa saddex ka mid ah.
We go back a long time.	Waxaan dib u noqon waqti dheer.
They will probably do it.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sameyn doonaan.
It was not right.	Wax sax ah ma ahayn.
It looks fresh.	Waxay u egtahay mid cusub.
It was back and forth.	Hor iyo dib ayaa loo ahaa.
I assumed they could not stop, he said to himself.	Waxaan u qaatay in aanay joojin karin, ayuu is yidhi.
He wondered what he was doing now.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa uu hadda samaynayo.
So it is with me.	Sidaas oo kale aniga.
I am something else.	Waxaan ahay wax kale.
I do not know if this is strange.	Ma garanayo inay taasi yaab tahay.
No problems were reported	Wax dhib ah lama sheegin
I think.	Waxaan filayaa.
It would not have been so for a long time.	Muddo dheer sidaas ma ahaan lahayd.
I'm sorry nothing.	Waan ka xumahay waxba.
I will do this.	Waan qaban doonaa tan.
There are things you can't do, however you want to.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aadan sameyn karin, si kasta oo aad rabto.
He said.	Waxa uu yidhi.
There is no chance.	Fursad ma jirto.
It was a difficult time for him.	Waxay ahayd wakhti adag isaga.
I still want one.	Wali waxaan rabaa mid.
It was to get more out of it.	Waxay ahayd in wax badan laga helo.
Now it is you.	Hadda waa adiga.
This is exactly what happened here.	Tani waa dhab ahaan waxa halkan ka dhacay.
It would do everything for you.	Wax walba way kuu qaban lahayd.
He was.	Waxa uu ahaa.
Like you	Adiga oo kale
That can't be.	Taas ma noqon karto.
I have never seen him like that.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale.
It is real.	Waa wax dhab ah.
I do not know what is in me.	Ma garanayo waxa igu jira.
They love you.	Way ku jecel yihiin.
A few years to come.	Dhowr sano ayaa soo socda.
He was amazing, and amazing.	Wuxuu ahaa yaab, iyo yaab.
Everything is fine so far.	Wax walba waa wanaagsan yihiin ilaa hadda.
Maybe he already had one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hore u lahaa mid.
If he did, he left.	Haddii uu sameeyay, wuu ka baxay.
I became a person other than myself.	Waxaan noqday qof aan aniga ahayn.
So he found me.	Sidaas ayuu igu helay.
He should have known that.	Waa inuu taas ogaa.
Probably so.	Malaha sidaas bay ahayd.
I'm not sure it will happen.	Ma hubo inay dhici doonto.
I know there is a chance of that.	Waan ogahay inay jirto fursad taas.
I can see.	Ma arki kartid.
You have to do everything.	Waa inaad wax walba samayso.
As this is very difficult.	Sida tan waa mid aad u adag.
I was clear.	Waxaan ku jiray cad.
I just have to.	Kaliya waa inaan.
But what you say is true.	Laakiin waxa aad leedahay waa run.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.
I'm glad she did.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay samaysay.
I can't do anything.	waxba ma samayn karo.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kama qabo.
It was exactly what it was.	Waxay ahayd dhab ahaan waxay ahayd.
He looks good.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid wanaagsan.
She won't hurt me, she loves me.	Ima yeeli doonto, way i jeceshahay.
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
Is the best.	Ayaa ugu fiican.
This has been so far, he said.	Tani waxay ahayd ilaa hadda, ayuu yidhi.
He refused to leave.	Wuu diiday inuu baxo.
I will never get anything.	Weligay waxba ma heli doono.
But there is nothing she can do about it.	Laakiin ma jirto wax ay ka qaban karto.
It can go away.	Way bixi kartaa.
Not so long ago.	Ma aha waqti dheer ka hor.
I will go	Waan tagi doonaa
Long one.	Mid dheer.
And much more is coming.	Oo wax badan oo kale ayaa soo socda.
They make money.	Waxay ku sameeyaan lacag.
Not so great.	Sida wax weyn maaha.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I started well.	Waxaan ku bilaabay si fiican.
All I say is.	Kaliya waxaan leeyahay waa.
Not that I think it's true.	Ma aha inaan u malayn inay run tahay.
He would like to be somewhere else.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu meel kale joogo.
I need to know.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado.
There was a problem.	Halkaas waxaa ka dhacay wax dhib ah.
You and I have a lot in common.	Aniga iyo adiga, wax badan ayaan isku mid nahay.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa ka dhacay.
Something similar to exactly.	Wax la mid ah si sax ah.
That's what he is after.	Taasi waa waxa uu ka dib.
No one is present.	Qofna ma joogo.
But I will not come.	Laakiin u iman maayo.
She didn't want him there.	Ma ay rabin isaga halkaas.
It is enough for me.	Waa igu filan tahay.
Now he felt someone else.	Hadda wuxuu dareemay qof kale.
But it would be better if it were.	Laakiin way fiicnaan lahayd haddii ay ahaan lahayd.
Tell me.	Ii sheeg.
Can you believe it?	Ma rumaysan kartaa?
That does not exist now.	Taasi hadda ma jirto.
I tried to tell you that.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan taas kuu sheego.
No one knew where he was.	Meesha cidna kuma uu garanayn.
She told me something.	Wax bay ii sheegtay.
That will require very hard work.	Taasi waxay u baahan doontaa shaqo aad u adag.
And there was something.	Oo waxaa jiray wax.
I need to say.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sheego.
He may not speak to me anymore.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan mar dambe ila hadlin.
Maybe, for a while.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, in muddo ah.
Just pay it off	Kaliya iska bixi
Someone needs to do it.	Qof ayaa u baahan inuu sameeyo.
We will have a good time.	Waxaan qaadan doonaa waqti fiican.
No one can help me.	Qofna ma i caawin karaa.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I expect him to be there.	Waxaan filayaa inuu halkaas joogo.
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
All by yourself.	Dhammaan adiga keligaa.
Sure, he didn’t.	Hubaal, ma uusan haysan.
And a day later.	Iyo maalin ka dib.
I am so glad you are with us today.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaad maanta nala joogto.
I am in one now	Mid baan ku jiraa hadda
Same for everyone, really.	La mid ah qof walba, runtii.
There is a lot going on.	Wax badan baa ka socda.
Little was said.	Wax yar baa la odhan jiray.
Not that one is better than the other.	Ma aha in mid ka mid ah uu ka fiican yahay kan kale.
That is what he did.	Taas oo ah waxa uu sameeyay.
He decided to work from home.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu ka shaqeeyo guriga.
Nothing bigger money.	Wax lacag ka weyn.
And whatever happened to it.	Iyo wax kasta oo ku dhacay.
Definitely enough, she did.	Hubaal ku filan, way samaysay.
It was a very bad time for me.	Waxay ii ahayd wakhti aad u xun.
He got a chance.	Waxa uu fursad u helay.
After a while.	Wax yar ka dib.
I see nothing else.	Wax kale ma arko.
She just didn't want to.	Kaliya ma ay rabin.
I tried to do everything.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax walba sameeyo.
She was very smart.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u caqli badan.
I look forward to working with you again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale kula shaqeeyo.
I knew he would come.	Waan ogaa inuu iman doono.
That was some time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd muddo ka hor.
I was beautiful.	Waxaan ahaa qurux.
I just thought.	Kaliya waxaan u maleeyay.
But enough for me.	Laakiin igu filan.
I can't find it	ma heli karo
he would take.	wuu qaadan lahaa.
I heard it said	Waxaan maqlay in la yidhi
I did not like it	Maan jeclayn
It's more complicated than that.	Way ka dhib badan tahay taas.
You can not stay here	Halkan ma joogi kartid
I really enjoyed that.	Aad ayaan uga helay taas.
There was so much we did not know about him.	Waxa jiray wax badan oo aanu ka ogayn isaga.
He may have tried it once.	Waxa laga yaabaa in uu hal mar isku dayay.
Now this is small.	Hadda tani way yar tahay.
That was interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
To a man.	Ku nin.
We are for sure.	Waxaan hubaal nahay.
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
It is much bigger than that.	Aad bay uga weyn tahay taas.
Maybe he knows.	Malaha wuu garanayaa.
And honestly, no more.	Iyo run, in ka badan maaha.
He is really good.	Runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
People like you.	Dadka adiga oo kale ah.
If he will find you without being told.	Haddii uu ku heli doono adiga oo aan lagu odhan.
And he stays in prison.	Oo uu xabsiga ka sii joogo.
But he lost one.	Laakiin wuu waayay mid.
This is very good.	Tani aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
But it will require hard work.	Laakiin waxay u baahan doontaa shaqo adag.
Maybe he doesn't want to know me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan rabin inuu i ogaado.
We can't stop now.	Hadda ma joojin karno.
There is no hard time.	Waqti adag ma jiro.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
It had nothing to do with it.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn.
But now, what you are doing is very good.	Laakiin hadda, waxa aad samaynayso aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I got several as well.	Waxaan helay dhowr sidoo kale.
And untrue at the same time.	Iyo mid aan run ahayn isku mar.
I thought it was a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ahayd fikrad fiican.
I really like that.	Runtii waan jeclahay taas.
Too much for each one.	Aad bay ugu badan tahay mid kasta.
But they are in it.	Laakiin way ku jiraan.
Something happened.	Wax baa dhacay.
I have always said so.	Weligay sidaas ayaan odhan jiray.
It was beautiful what he did.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan waxa uu sameeyay.
One more time.	Hal mar oo kale.
Ima arag.	Ima arag.
He was a tall, handsome man.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dheer, nin wanaagsan.
It was real.	Dhab buu ahaa.
And maybe that was it.	Oo malaha taasi waxay ahayd.
Don't do this again.	Mar dambe tan ha samayn.
I picked it up here and there.	Halkan iyo halkaas ayaan ka soo qaaday.
You know.	Waad ogtahay.
I want to help you get better.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa caawiyo sidii aad u fiicnaan lahayd.
Do not talk too much.	Aad ha u hadlin.
I was very.	Aad baan u ahaa.
Why he.	Waa maxay sababta uu .
And bad for everyone.	Oo qof walba u xun.
Now he has to stay home.	Hadda waa inuu guriga joogo.
They said nothing to me.	Waxba igama ay odhan aniga.
I really am not	Runtii ma ihi
I love school	Waxaan jeclahay dugsiga
He is still there.	Wali ma joogo.
Nice to see you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
But he was not.	Laakiin ma uusan ahayn.
She had to be told.	Waxay ahayd in loo sheego.
It will come to me.	Way ii iman doontaa.
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
He looked good.	Si fiican buu u eegay.
Everyone had.	Qof kastaa wuu lahaa.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
We can't do that yet.	Taas weli ma samayn karno.
Are you like me?	Ma adiga oo kale?.
The latter is expected, it said.	Tan dambe ayaa la filayaa, sida la sheegay.
I was home	Waxaan ahaa guriga
But you will take it.	Laakiin waad qaadan doontaa.
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
Something felt.	Wax la dareemay.
I will make money for you	Lacag baan kuu samayn doonaa
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
This is too much.	Tani waa mid aad u badan.
Maybe she had.	Malaha way lahayd.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
The new one.	Kan cusub.
But maybe not for long.	Laakiin malaha muddo dheer maaha.
How to do it at home.	Sida aad guriga ku samayn lahayd.
But it was clear.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid cad.
I don't want to know.	Ma rabo inaan ogaado.
She is like someone else.	Waxay la mid tahay qof kale.
It was not even mentioned.	Xitaa lama sheegin.
That would be fun for me.	Taasi waxay ii noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
I don't want to stay here.	Ma doonayo inaan halkaan sii joogo.
This is how it looks most often.	Tani waa sida ay u egtahay inta badan.
Still not sure how.	Wali ma hubo sida.
That can do it.	Taasi way samayn kartaa.
But it is so.	Laakiin waa sidaas.
It would not take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan lahayd.
If you like, great.	Haddii aad jeceshahay, weyn.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha taasi waa sax.
Only a small one.	Kaliya mid yar.
I left here	halkaan waan ka baxay
Maybe he wanted something better than what he had.	Malaha wuxuu ku rabay wax ka wanaagsan kan uu haysto.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
This is a good thing to learn.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan in la barto.
She looks like me.	Waxay ila tahay aniga oo kale.
They will not take it.	Ma qaadan doonaan.
Now it's amazing.	Hadda waa yaab.
Do not leave anything false.	Wax been ah ha ka tagin.
If they are, great.	Haddii ay yihiin, weyn.
But you will be fine.	Laakiin waad fiicnaan doontaa.
What can one say.	Muxuu mid ku odhan karaa.
We just are.	Waxa kaliya ee aan nahay.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
That's how he did it.	Waa sidii uu sameeyay.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
The nearest place is good.	Meesha ugu dhow ayaa wanaagsan.
He is a very handsome man.	Waa nin aad u qurux badan.
I do it every day.	Waxaan sameeyaa maalin kasta.
It is not known if this persists for the rest of their lives.	Lama garanayo in tani ay joogto tahay inta ay nool yihiin oo dhan.
Nothing more to say.	Wax kale oo la sheego ma jirto.
It was true and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd run iyo qurux.
There was no pick-up truck.	Ma jirin baabuur lagu soo qaado.
I liked it tonight.	Caawa waan ka helay.
Right away.	Isla markii hore.
Maybe a good man did the same.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in nin wanaagsan uu sidaas oo kale sameeyay.
And what a good man you are.	Oo maxaad nin wanaagsan leedahay.
She needs it.	Waxay u baahan tahay.
But not as it really is.	Laakiin maaha sida ay dhab ahaantii tahay.
I didn't want to stay.	Ma rabin inaan sii jiro.
You said this could not happen.	Waxaad tidhi tani ma dhici karto.
But it is definitely a surprise.	Laakiin hubaal waa yaab.
Good for you.	Adiga kuu wanaagsan.
I put it in the back door.	Albaabka dambe ayaan dhigay.
No one else is alive.	Ma jiro qof kale oo nool.
You have not seen him.	Ma aadan arag isaga.
I don't feel like doing anything.	Ma dareemayo inaan wax sameeyo.
It was the same every day.	Maalin walba isku mid bay ahayd.
She doesn't seem to be doing that anymore.	Uma eka inay taas mar dambe samayso.
I will stay there	Waan joogi doonaa halkaas
There was nothing.	Waxba ma jirin.
He wants to see.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu arko.
He just went to do it.	Kaliya wuu u aaday inuu sameeyo.
I'm sorry about that !.	Waan ka xumahay taas!.
There is so much to see.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo la arko.
I think they love each other.	Waxaan filayaa inay is jecel yihiin.
I was here	halkaan ayaan joogay
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
Maybe there is something we can do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax aan sameyn karno.
I'm still scared.	Weli waan ka baqayaa.
And he said.	Oo sidaas yidhi.
This was awful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Now there is no problem.	Hadda wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
So that they are no longer present.	Si aanay mar dambe u joogin.
That surprises us.	Taasi waa nagu yaab.
Good thing too.	Wax fiican sidoo kale.
Until recently,	Ilaa dhawaan,
We need to know.	Waxaan u baahanahay in la ogaado.
I was here once, with a friend.	Waxaan hal mar la joogay halkan, aniga iyo saaxiib.
I hope you know what this is.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ogtahay waxa ay tani tahay.
I think you are not here.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaadan halkan joogin.
I can't do anything right now.	Hadda wax ma qaban karo.
That is for everyone.	Taasi waa qof walba.
I am very happy now.	Hadda aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
Tomorrow will be great.	Berrito waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
Very good.	Fiican fiican.
Everyone loves it.	Qof walba wuu jecel yahay.
Good !.	Mid wanaagsan!.
It's a great idea.	Waa fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
There is so much that you do not yet understand.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo aadan weli fahmin.
Why didn't he do it.	Waa maxay sababta uu u samayn waayay.
He should want it better.	Waa inuu si ka wanaagsan u rabaa.
It should not be a problem.	Waa in aanay dhibaato noqon.
This was one.	Tani waxay ahayd mid.
It was long.	Waxay ahayd mid dheer.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
Maybe it’s too much, too big.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u badan tahay, aad u weyn tahay.
He knew why he was doing this.	Wuu ogaa sababta uu tan u samaynayo.
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
I got everything out of it.	Wax walba waan ka baxay.
I heard you.	Waan kaa maqlay.
He probably has no idea who you are.	Waxay u badan tahay inuusan wax fikrad ah ka haysan qofka aad tahay.
Maybe he is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uu yahay.
I can't say clearly.	Si cad uma odhan karo.
I know they can't.	Waan ogahay inaysan awoodin.
He looked at me, at me.	Wuu i soo eegay, aniga.
It’s not that I don’t want to, I do.	Ma ahan inaanan rabin, waan sameeyaa.
Somehow, she had.	Si ahaan, waxay lahayd.
I would like to know.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado.
As good as it is, it is bigger.	Sida ay u wanaagsan tahay, waa ka weyn tahay.
You are the only one.	Adiga kaliya ayaa tahay.
He is not a smart man, but a good man.	Ma aha nin caqli badan, laakiin nin wanaagsan.
Maybe it was a good idea to tell someone.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan in qof loo sheego.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
Here was a great opportunity.	Halkan waxay ahayd fursad weyn.
I decided not to.	Waxaan go'aansaday in aan.
This is the same.	Tani waa isku mid.
I have to eat.	Waa inaan wax cuno.
You believe me.	Waad i rumaysan tahay.
you can lie	been baad sheegi kartaa
But that will be seen.	Laakiin taasi waa la arki doonaa.
That is very difficult to do.	Taasi aad bay u adag tahay in la sameeyo.
I had no money.	Wax lacag ah maan haysan.
We are just.	Waxaan nahay kaliya.
You can help me, if you want.	Waad i caawin kartaa, haddii aad rabto.
He has already come out.	Hore ayuu u soo baxay.
A little is good.	Inta yar ayaa fiican.
There is nothing permanent, nothing real.	Ma jiraan wax joogto ah, ma jiraan wax dhab ah.
I have seen this before.	Tan hore ayaan u arkay.
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
Like, you always have.	Sida, had iyo jeer waxaad ahayd.
He wanted to do everything.	Wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo wax walba.
Everyone and no one, everything and nothing.	Qof kasta iyo cidna, wax walba iyo waxba.
It was a lot of work to get nothing, too.	Waxay ahayd shaqo badan inaan waxba helin, sidoo kale.
That is more likely, he decided.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay, ayuu go'aansaday.
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
This is a lie.	Tani waa been.
Everyone loves me.	Qof kastaa wuu i jecel yahay.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
But it was great.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
Only one real white man.	Kaliya hal nin oo cad oo dhab ah.
That is too much.	Taasi waa mid aad u badan.
Take time, but not too much time.	Waqti qaado, laakiin waqti aad u badan maaha.
To say nothing.	Si aan waxba u sheegin.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
I never got it.	Weligay maan helin.
This is the biggest.	Tani waa tan ugu weyn.
Probably it was.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd.
I do not know what to say.	Wax uu ku hadlo ma garanayo.
He was a very smart man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin caqli badan.
You can see, right ?.	Waad arki kartaa, sax?.
This is true.	Waa kan run.
Like new.	Sida cusub.
Immediately she lost.	Isla markii ay weyday.
You should be happy with that.	Waa inaad ku faraxsan tahay taas.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I will probably do it.	Waxay u badan tahay inaan sameyn doono.
Surprise, surprise, surprise.	Yaab, yaab, yaab.
I think this is a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad fiican.
I don't feel that way today.	Maanta sidaas uma dareemayo.
I know he knows us.	Waan ogahay inuu naga yaqaan.
It may go away in time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waqti ka dib uu tago.
They would not stay long.	Muddo dheer ma ay joogi lahayn.
I will not get anything like that.	Wax la mid ah ma heli doono.
I just did not understand.	kaliya ma fahmin.
I do not want to go home	Ma rabo inaan guriga aado
It is very common.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
Do you know.	Ma ogtahay.
It was not beautiful.	Ma ahayn mid qurux badan.
Very interesting to see what is going on there.	Aad u xiiso badan in la arko waxa halkaas ka socda.
First, we can do nothing.	Marka hore, waxba ma samayn karno.
It’s nothing new, either.	Ma aha wax cusub, sidoo kale.
It was not enough.	Ma ahayn mid ku filan.
I had to do it, otherwise worse things would have happened.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo, haddii kale waxyaabo ka sii xun ayaa dhici lahaa.
That he did something very bad.	In uu sameeyay wax aad u xun.
But they will get better.	Laakiin way fiicnaan doonaan.
I was at work.	Waxaan ku jiray shaqada.
You did the right thing.	Waxaad samaysay wax sax ah.
I tried to do more.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sameeyo wax badan.
This will not allow.	Tani ma ogolaan doontaa.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
As they do.	Sida ay sameeyaan.
He said that was really a good idea.	Wuxuu sheegay in taasi runtii tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
I have to tell you something.	Waa inaan wax kuu sheego.
But it looked good.	Laakiin si fiican ayuu u muuqday.
Tell me where he is.	Meesha uu joogo ii sheeg.
To let you know a little bit.	Si aan kuu yara ogaado.
It was someone else.	Waxay ahayd qof kale.
He wants me to tell him.	Wuxuu rabaa inaan u sheego.
I knew she had.	Waan ogaa inay leedahay.
I go.	waan tagi.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
They were not friends.	Ma ahayn saaxiibo.
You are not alone in this.	Kaliya adiga kuma aadan joogin kan.
This is what will happen.	Tani waa waxa dhici doona.
I looked back	Dib ayaan eegay
It was a very, very bad day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u xun oo aad u xun.
Maybe that's why.	Malaha taasi waa sababta.
Both are at the same time.	Labaduba waa hal mar.
It was a bad place.	Meel xun bay ahayd.
Opportunity tried again.	Fursad mar kale la isku dayay.
Day, day.	Maalin, maalin.
There was nothing else he said.	Ma jirin wax kale oo uu sheego.
Now this is the only thing you can do.	Hadda tani waa waxa kaliya ee aad sameyn karto.
Although he is older,	In kasta oo uu ka weyn yahay,
I'm really happy for him now.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga hadda.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
That was it too.	Taasi waxay ahayd sidoo kale.
He will get some chance.	Waxa uu heli doonaa xoogaa fursad ah.
But, no one knows what will happen.	Laakiin, qofna ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
I did not want to stay home.	Ma aanan rabin in aan sii joogo guriga.
Everything is correct.	Wax walba sax.
You do not have to say until you want to say.	Uma baahnid inaad sheegto ilaa aad rabto inaad sheegto.
It can happen to anyone.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
But that was it.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd.
There is no other amount of money.	Ma jiro lacag kale oo lacag ah.
That is a very bad idea.	Taasi waa fikrad aad u xun.
But nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma jiraan.
I tried each one.	Waxaan isku dayay mid kasta.
It really looks great.	Dhab ahaantii wuxuu u muuqdaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
You can stop what will happen.	Waad joojin kartaa waxa dhici doona.
You are a good friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib wanaagsan.
He knows you are here.	Wuu ogyahay inaad halkan joogto.
It looks like he needs one.	Waxay u egtahay inuu u baahan yahay mid.
Maybe I was good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ahaa mid wanaagsan.
They should not have done this.	Ma ahayn inay tan sameeyaan.
Not now and never again.	Hadda maaha iyo mar dambe.
Not sure how to do this.	Ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
Otherwise it would be better.	Haddii kale way fiicnaan lahayd.
He did really well, too.	Runtii si fiican ayuu sameeyay, sidoo kale.
He was in it, now.	Wuu ku jiray, hadda.
No one could hurt me.	Qofna ima yeeli karin.
She had me.	Way igu lahayd.
This is so beautiful.	Tani waa mid aad u qurux badan.
It was too late.	Waxay ahayd goor dambe.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
It was still, if you want to know.	Weli wuu ahaa, haddii aad rabto inaad ogaato.
No one is talking.	Qofna lama hadlo.
For a very long time	Muddo aad u dheer
I haven't seen it in a long time.	Muddo dheer maan arag.
Like many other things.	Sida waxyaabo kale oo badan.
But it was still something.	Laakiin weli wax bay ahayd.
This sounds like an interesting problem.	Tani waxay u egtahay dhibaato xiiso leh.
I will not win!	Ma guulaysan doono!
I can do that, you know.	Taas waan samayn karaa, waad ogtahay.
He thought so.	Sidaas ayuu u maleeyay.
But it was a very bad car.	Laakiin waxay ahayd baabuur aad u xun.
Not everything.	Wax walba maaha.
I don't think they are that close.	Uma maleynayo inay sidaas u dhow yihiin.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Inaad halkan kula joogto fikrad fiican maaha.
He refused to talk to me.	Wuu diiday inuu ila hadlo.
That is what came to you.	Taasi waa waxa kugu soo galay.
He wants to tell her.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu u sheego.
He is nobody.	Cidna uma aha.
We can not see.	Ma arki karno.
I could not get enough.	Ma heli karin wax ku filan.
That will not happen, he thought.	Taasi ma iman doonto, ayuu is yidhi.
He is clearly happy.	Si cad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay.
But there is something wrong.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax aan sax ahayn.
It looks a little weird.	Waxay u egtahay wax yar oo xun.
he could not see.	wuu arki waayay.
He was with someone else.	Qof kale ayuu la lahaa.
You will be able to stay in it.	Waxaad awoodi doontaa inaad ku sii jirto.
It was new.	Waxay ahayd cusub.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma hayo.
He did it again.	Mar kale ayuu sameeyay.
He was very surprised.	Aad buu ula yaabay.
I don't know how he got into it.	Ma garanayo sida uu u galay.
He really said.	Runtii wuu yidhi.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
Too bad.	Waxyaabo aad u xun.
He made a lot of money.	Waxa uu helay lacag aad u badan.
According to him.	Sida uu sheegay.
It really was three years.	Runtii waxay ahayd saddex sano.
He was less than a year old.	Waxa uu jiray wax ka yar hal sano.
It really isn't.	Runtii kuma jiro.
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
Not how he did it.	Ma aha sida uu u sameeyay.
No one should go.	Qofna ma aha inuu tago.
You are better than others.	Dadka kale waad ka fiican tahay.
More regularly.	In ka badan si joogto ah.
Here it will be really interesting.	Halkan waxa ay noqon doontaa runtii xiiso leh.
That was until he got it.	Taasi waxay ahayd ilaa inta uu helay.
No one is new.	Ma jiro qof cusub.
This should tell us something.	Tani waa inay wax noo sheegto.
Good one.	Mid wanaagsan.
Something bad.	Wax xun.
Nor was he a man.	Sidoo kale ma ahayn nin.
She can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karto.
I do it often	Inta badan waan sameeyaa
No one will take it.	Qofna ku qaadan maayo.
I think there is one small problem.	Waxaan filayaa inay jirto hal dhibaato oo yar.
I don't think he will.	Uma maleynayo inuu sameyn doono.
He was with her.	Wuu la joogay.
He is much better.	Aad ayuu uga fiican yahay.
But they did not like me.	Laakiin ima jeclayn.
It is true that he wants to see it again.	Waa sax inuu rabo inuu mar kale arko.
One more time.	Hal mar oo kale.
What a good idea.	Waa maxay fikrad wanaagsan.
There is nothing we will not do.	Wax aanu samayn doonin ma jiro.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I wish him luck.	Waxaan u rajeynayaa nasiib.
But this is not how it is.	Laakiin tani maaha sida ay tahay.
That is not true.	Runtii taasi run maaha.
So far, so good.	Ilaa laga sheego, taasi waa.
We can not do that yet.	Taas weli ma samayn karno.
He looked clearly.	Si cad ayuu u eegay.
I always seem to do this.	Mar walba waxaan u muuqdaa inaan tan sameeyo.
One man.	Hal nin .
He told me he could definitely help.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu hubaal caawin karo.
Let me see that.	Aan taas arko.
It's good.	Waa mid wanaagsan.
Nothing and no one.	Waxba iyo cidna.
Apparently, he had done this before.	Waxaa cad, inuu tan hore u sameeyay.
You can even come out.	Xitaa waad soo bixi kartaa.
This is also true here.	Tani sidoo kale waa run halkan.
Something made me.	Wax baa iga dhigay.
He tried to do it.	Waxa uu isku dayay inuu sameeyo.
I love you, no problem.	Waan ku jeclahay, dhib malaha.
It's hard to say the rest.	Way adag tahay in aan sheego inta kale.
Stop that.	Jooji taas.
That's right, you know.	Waa sax, waad ogtahay.
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
I would not have otherwise.	Si kale uma haysan lahaa.
He is very happy.	Aad ayuu u faraxsan yahay.
Everyone can see everyone else.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa qof kasta oo kale.
It can't hurt me.	Waxba ima yeeli karto.
I did.	waan sameeyay.
They are true old friends.	Waa saaxiibo hore oo run ah.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
It was a great time for you.	Waqti weyn buu kuu dhacay.
There is no money.	Lacag ma jirto.
I do not want to	ma rabo
No one even spoke.	Qofna xitaa ma hadlin.
And what are you !.	Oo maxaad tahay!.
There is nothing you can do.	Wax aad qaban kartaa ma jiraan.
I am not beautiful.	Qurux ma ihi.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
That was a bad time.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti xun.
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
I don't want to be anywhere else.	Ma doonayo inaan meel kale joogo.
I think he said that.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu sidaas yidhi.
You can't leave	Kama bixi kartid
He did not come home.	Ma iman guriga.
I'll talk about that later.	Dib ayaan uga hadli doonaa.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Wuxuu rabay oo kaliya inuu la hadlo.
I did not know.	Maan garanayn.
He is very smart.	Aad buu u caqli badan yahay.
I am so excited to see you again!	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko!
He did everything else well.	Wax walba oo kale si fiican ayuu u sameeyay.
He was there.	Wuu joogay.
Anyone involved should go.	Qof kasta oo arrintan wax ku lahaa waa inuu tago.
Something difficult.	Wax adag.
But, he did, right? '	Laakiin, wuu sameeyay, sax?'
But, one day, it will happen.	Laakiin, maalin, way dhici doontaa.
But it is not very difficult.	Laakiin aad uma adag.
That is up to you.	Taasi waa adiga inaad sameyso.
It was an amazing day.	Waxay ahayd maalin yaab leh.
That is what it is.	Waa waxa ay tahay.
Unemployed, free.	Shaqo la'aan, lacag la'aan.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
It's hard to do anything.	Way adag tahay inay wax sameeyaan.
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
But this one did.	Laakiin kan ayaa sameeyay.
They do so.	Waxay sameeyaan sidaas.
She needs a good man.	Waxay u baahan tahay nin wanaagsan.
He felt a lot.	Wax badan ayuu dareemay.
Do not take that from him.	Taas isaga ha ka qaadan.
I have a problem.	dhib ayaan leeyahay.
I know you do what you can.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyso waxaad awoodo.
We need to do it.	Waxaan u baahanahay in la sameeyo.
I don't have much money.	Lacag badan ma haysto.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Hadda maaha, malaha mar dambe.
You said, for sure.	Waxaad tidhi, waa hubaal.
I will give it.	waan siin doonaa.
I am very happy for myself.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay aniga.
I am a man	waxaan ahay nin
I did not find one like me.	Maan helin mid ila mid ah.
It did not take long to do.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer in la sameeyo.
But she can't see.	Laakiin ma arki karto.
I still can't believe it.	Wali ma rumaysan karo.
Not much.	Ma badna.
did not see.	ma arag.
He had no money.	Lacag ma uu haysan.
It would be great to see you again.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay inaan mar kale ku arko.
This is a great opportunity.	Tani waa fursad weyn.
You were lucky.	Nasiib baad lahayd.
This should not take much time.	Tani waa inaysan qaadan waqti badan.
As many times as you want.	Inta jeer ee aad rabto.
Why there, he says, and that there is.	Waa maxay sababta halkaas, ayuu yidhi, iyo in ay jirto.
Give it to us.	Na sii.
He looked troubled.	Dhib buu eegay.
Would you do that, would you?	Ma aad samayn lahayd taas, ma samayn lahayd?
He was tough and tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag oo adag.
I began to see.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan arko.
Not much.	Ma badna.
Hard luck.	Nasiib adag.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
It was done all the time.	Waa la samayn jiray mar walba.
Now he feels troubled.	Hadda waxa uu dareemay dhib.
He knows you are a busy man.	Wuu ogyahay inaad tahay nin mashquul badan.
He knows, he knows.	Waxa uu yaqaan, wuu garanayaa.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
I was surprised by him.	Waxaan la yaabay isaga.
It may be correct.	Wuxuu noqon karaa mid sax ah.
I can't talk long.	Ma hadli karo dheer.
It was a little beautiful.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo qurux badan.
Great place.	Meel aad u fiican.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
I didn't find anything.	waxba maan helin.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
She did.	Way samaysay.
I hope you will.	Waxaan filayaa inaad samayn doonto.
I am happy to do it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay in la sameeyo.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
I could not let him go.	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu iska baxo.
I did	waan sameeyay
I still do not understand.	Wali ma fahmin.
Sure, it looks good.	Hubaal, wuxuu u muuqdaa mid wanaagsan.
I think they are beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan yihiin.
It really isn't that hard.	Runtii sidaas uma dhib badna.
You were not present.	Ma aadan joogin.
I do not want to be around again.	Ma rabo inaan mar kale noqdo.
It should.	Waa in.
It may be too big for him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad ugu weyn tahay isaga.
I do not see what she should be happy about.	Ma arko waxa ay tahay in ay ku faraxsan tahay.
It looks like, man.	Waxay u egtahay, nin.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
But apparently someone was at home.	Laakiin sida cad qof baa guriga joogay.
Maybe you are one of them.	Malaha waxaad ka mid tahay.
I do not have to find out.	Ma hayo si aan wax ku ogaado.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I am a man.	waxaan ahay nin.
I need some time here.	Waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa waqti halkan.
He wanted to stay.	Wuxuu rabay inuu sii joogo.
I may not do this.	Tan waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan sameyn.
He thought she would get money from him.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in ay lacag ka heli doonto.
A lot of it was an opportunity.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah waxay ahayd fursad.
Several times more, actually.	Dhowr jeer in ka badan, dhab ahaantii.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
Everyone knows it now.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa hadda.
He did not say.	Ma uu odhan.
It was not what was done.	Ma ahayn waxa la sameeyay.
It was yesterday, really.	Waxay ahayd shalay, dhab ahaantii.
I love this one too.	kan sidoo kale waan jeclahay.
Not just here.	Ma aha halkan oo kaliya.
He left.	Wuu tagay.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan ahayn.
He would say I will come, but he did not come.	Wuxuu odhan lahaa waan iman doonaa, laakiin ma uu iman.
Take it, take it.	Qaado, qaado.
I should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si fiican u ogaado.
But it usually says nothing.	Laakiin inta badan waxba ma sheegto.
But it's really amazing.	Laakiin si dhab ah ayuu yaab leh.
Nothing was said.	Waxba lama sheegin.
She said it was something she had to do.	Waxay sheegtay inay ahayd wax ay ahayd inay samayso.
No wonder, that.	La yaab ma leh, taas.
You can't have it all.	Ma wada haysan kartid.
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
Who is it.	Waa kuma.
But let me tell you this.	Laakiin aan kuu sheego tan.
I want to know what they are.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxay yihiin.
I could not do that.	Taas ma yeeli karin.
He said he would do it.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu qaban doono.
Live close.	Nool dhow.
What a good idea.	Waa maxay fikrad wanaagsan.
That is what exists.	Taasi waa waxa jira.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
I wanted to see what would happen.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko waxa dhici doona.
A little he wanted.	Wax yar oo uu rabay.
No one can do that now.	Qofna taas ma samayn karo hadda.
I promised it wasn't me.	Waxaan ballan qaaday in aanay aniga ahayn.
Otherwise, he certainly won't.	Haddii kale, waa hubaal inuusan samayn.
Well enough.	Si fiican ugu filan.
Much earlier.	Wax badan oo hore.
It was a lot of work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo badan.
I returned home after work.	Waxaan ku soo noqday guriga ka dib markii shaqada.
You can take it.	Waad qaadan kartaa.
It will be very soon.	Waxay noqon doontaa waqti dhow dhow.
He will not tell us anything.	Waxba noo sheegi maayo.
I really liked that	Runtii taas waan ka helay
But it is like.	Laakiin waa sida.
More now, even more.	In ka badan hadda, xitaa in ka badan.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
So much for everything familiar, not just food.	Aad u badan wax kasta oo la yaqaan, maaha kaliya cunto.
That was not too bad.	Taasi ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
But still, it seems less so.	Laakiin weli, wuxuu u muuqdaa mid ka yar.
But that's what.	Laakiin waa waxa.
Nice to see you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
He can do anything.	Wax walba wuu samayn karaa.
Tell her it is very good.	U sheeg inay tahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
But he did not come.	Laakiin ma iman.
I don't think that was right.	Uma malaynayo inay taasi sax ahayd.
But good for me.	Laakiin aniga ila fiican.
I didn't want to tell anyone.	Ma aanan rabin in aan cidna u sheego.
I was whole	Waxaan ahaa mid dhan
It was a lot of money.	Waxay ahayd lacag aad u badan.
I want you to help me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad i caawiso.
Not the same everywhere.	Isku mid maaha meel walba.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
Sax.	Sax.
He is there for me.	Wuu ii joogaa.
It just was.	Kaliya wuu ahaa.
But now, here it is again.	Laakiin hadda, waa kan mar kale.
She said it was not a good time now.	Waxay sheegtay in hadda aysan ahayn waqti fiican.
I really did this.	Runtii tan ayaan sameeyay.
That is a very good job.	Taasi waa shaqo aad u fiican.
I just didn’t know how and why.	Kaliya maan garanayn sida iyo sababta.
And it will do nothing.	Oo waxba ma samayn doonto.
I was surprised by this.	Waxaan la yaabay tan.
There is another one of us.	Waxaa jira mid kale oo naga mid ah.
I was just a man.	Waxaan ahaa nin kaliya.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
I do not understand this.	Ma fahmin tan.
Something to eat.	Wax la cuno.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
This is something no one likes to do.	Tani waa wax uusan qofna jeclayn inuu sameeyo.
It will not be again.	Mar dambe ma noqon doonto.
You have to be smart.	Waa in aad caqli badan tahay.
I know it is.	Waan ogahay inay tahay.
But, it is still difficult.	Laakiin, weli way adag tahay.
We will do so.	Waanu samayn doonaa sidaas.
Like, really.	Sida, dhab ahaantii.
In fact, it is very, very difficult.	Dhab ahaantii, aad iyo aad bay u adag tahay.
I can't have it	Ma haysan karo
I have to get everything right.	Waa inaan wax walba si sax ah u helo.
He knew what to do.	Wuu ogaa waxa ay tahay inuu sameeyo.
Not just one other person, too.	Ma aha oo kaliya hal qof oo kale, sidoo kale.
What happened? 	Maxaa ku dhacay?
Why did you refuse.	Maxaad u diiday.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
There you can see everything.	Halkaas ayaad wax walba ka arki kartaa.
I have a chance for him.	Waxaan u hayaa fursad isaga.
I was not able to work.	Ma awoodin inaan shaqeeyo.
He got it.	Wuu helay.
I really don't want to talk about it.	Runtii ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
She did not speak again.	Mar dambe ma aysan hadlin.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
As much as you tell.	Inta aad u sheegto.
I found.	waan helay.
He found the door.	Albaabka ayuu helay.
He saw it all clearly and badly.	Waxa uu dhammaan ku arkay si cad oo xun.
I had to leave something out.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax ka tago.
It really looked good.	Runtii wuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I did not know what it was.	Maan garanayn waxa uu yahay.
I did not see what happened to him.	Maan arag waxa ku dhacay.
He knows everything.	Wax walba wuu garanayaa.
Where he is when he is not with you.	Halka uu joogo marka uusan kula joogin.
Obviously this was nothing new.	Sida cad tani ma ahayn wax cusub.
Probably not everywhere.	Malaha meel walba maaha.
Something other than this.	Wax aan ahayn tan.
But much is not known.	Laakiin wax badan ayaan la garanayn.
I hope you are well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad si fiican u fiican tahay.
This would happen.	Tani way dhici lahayd.
It could still be.	Weli way noqon kartaa.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
Got a lot of it.	Wax badan ka helay.
I will never do such a thing again.	Mar dambe ma samayn doono wax sidaas oo kale ah.
Very difficult.	Aad u adag.
They really do, all the time.	Dhab ahaantii waxay sameeyaan, mar walba.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
It was a promise.	Waxay ahayd ballan.
But he wanted to.	Laakiin wuu rabay.
It was great to have it back.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in dib loo helo.
But he stayed.	Laakiin wuu joogay.
It can be awful.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xun.
He doesn't want to leave now.	Ma rabto inuu hadda baxo.
He owed a lot of money.	Lacag badan buu ku lahaa.
He did not have much time.	Ma uusan haysan waqti badan.
I can stay somewhere else tonight.	Meel kale ayaan caawa joogi karaa.
And at first it was popular.	Oo markii hore waxay ahayd mid la jecel yahay.
But she had to do more.	Laakiin waxay ahayd in ay sameyso wax badan.
He will surely succeed.	Waa hubaal inuu guulaysan doono.
You had to stay with me.	Waxay ahayd inaad ila joogto.
That's fine with me.	Taasi waa aniga ila fiican.
It was just so true.	Aad bay run u ahayd kaliya.
Good friend, even.	Saaxiib wanaagsan, xitaa.
There is very little.	Wax aad u yar ma jiro.
Man, so good.	Nin, si aad u wanaagsan.
At least it is good for every day.	Ugu yar ayaa u fiican maalin kasta.
I was not	Maan ahayn
Tonight, it's too much.	Caawa, aad bay u badan tahay.
It was hard work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
That will be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa wax weyn.
I am exactly the same.	Waxaan ahay isku si dhab ahaantii.
None of us can say anything.	Qof naga mid ah waxba uma sheegi karo.
She didn't want to lie.	Ma rabin inay been sheegto.
That was so far.	Taasi waxay ahayd ilaa hadda.
You know why.	Waad ogtahay sababta.
You can let it.	Waad u ogolaan kartaa.
Like, really great.	Sida, runtii weyn.
It is also a problem.	Sidoo kale waa dhib.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
To be.	Si ay ahayd.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax aan ka qaban karno.
Me and him.	Aniga iyo isaga.
This is definitely true.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa run.
As of now.	Sida hadda.
He is a friend.	Waa saaxiib.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay.
I am one.	Waxaan ahay mid.
And it is still here.	Oo weli waa halkan.
It will definitely happen soon.	Waa hubaal inay dhawaan dhici doonto.
What do you need.	Maxaad u baahan tahay.
What happened.	Maxaa dhacay.
But no one is there.	Laakiin qofna ma joogo.
There is nothing beautiful here	Ma jiraan wax qurux badan halkan
It's too big	Aad bay u weyn tahay
It can be true.	Waxay noqon kartaa run.
Everyone knows you.	Qof kastaa wuu kaa yaqaan.
She needs to know everything.	Waxay u baahan tahay inay wax walba ogaato.
You told me a little bit.	Wax yar baad ii sheegtay.
All in one place.	Dhammaan hal meel.
It is very much said.	Waa wax aad loo sheego.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
There was not much we could do.	Wax badan oo aanu samayn lahayn ma jirin.
I will not return	soo noqon maayo
It's just who you are.	Kaliya waa qofka aad tahay.
Everything is fine.	Wax walba way ku fiican tahay.
I really like it too.	Runtii aad ayaan u jeclahay sidoo kale.
It should	Waa in
But no one should have known that.	Laakiin qofna ma ahayn inuu taas ogaado.
No one wants it.	Qofna ma rabo.
Do not leave the house.	Ha ka bixin guriga.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
I really do not.	Runtii ma sameeyo.
Even more amazing.	Ka sii yaab badan.
This is what really happened.	Tani waa waxa runtii dhacay.
Definitely a favorite.	Dhab ahaantii waa la jecel yahay.
I will for sure.	Waxaan hubaal ahaan doonaa.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan .
For a very long time too.	Muddo aad u dheer sidoo kale.
It was here, home.	Waxay ahayd halkan, guriga.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
No one believed me.	Qofna ima rumaysan.
It was not fun.	Ma ahayn wax xiiso leh.
But she did not.	Laakiin way wayday.
He seemed to know exactly what to do.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu si sax ah u garanayo waxa la sameeyo.
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
This has always been difficult for me.	Tani had iyo jeer waa wax igu adag aniga.
He decided to tell her everything.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu u sheego wax walba.
And it probably is.	Oo waxay u badan tahay inay.
I don't think he ever did.	Uma maleynayo inuu waligiis sameeyay.
Just amazing at all.	Kaliya yaab leh oo dhan.
You don't need it anymore.	Uma baahnid mar dambe.
Run! 	Run!
Amazing things also happened there.	Waxyaabo yaab leh ayaa sidoo kale halkaas ka dhacay.
I just have it	Kaliya waan hayaa
That was enough.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax ku filan.
He knew he was.	Wuu ogaa inuu ahaa.
That is a lot!	Taasi waa wax badan!
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
They will stay here	Way joogi doonaan halkan
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Waxay ahayd inaan berrito shaqada aado.
It's more than a car.	Waa ka badan baabuur.
But this is something new.	Laakiin tani waa wax cusub.
And that he did.	Iyo in uu sameeyay.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
It is not difficult to see.	Ma aha mid adag in la arko.
Who did it? 	Yaa sameeyay?
I think he can.	Waxaan filayaa inuu awoodo.
It was small and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid yar oo qurux badan.
And you will make us a lot of money.	Oo waxaad naga samayn doontaa lacag aad u badan.
I, for one, am delighted.	Anigu, mid, waan ku faraxsanahay.
There is no way to know for sure.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado hubaal.
Nothing but money.	Wax aan ahayn lacag.
As you like.	Sida aad jeceshahay.
It is a new day.	Waa maalin cusub.
You will see, it will get better.	Waad arki doontaa, way fiicnaan doontaa.
Someone needs to stay home most of the time.	Qof ayaa u baahan inuu guriga la joogo inta badan.
You are too big.	Aad baad u weyn tahay.
I do	waan sameeyaa
I don't even want to do it.	Xitaa ma doonayo inaan sameeyo.
Everyone knew everything.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa wax walba.
So it is.	Sidaas oo ay tahay.
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
There are more of us.	Waxaa naga badan.
He knows what happened.	Wixii dhacay wuu garanayaa.
Really, we weren’t.	Runtii, waxaan ahayn.
And to see everything going on, just like that.	Iyo in la arko wax walba oo socda, sidaas oo kale.
Real and real wisdom.	Caqli dhab ah oo dhab ah.
It's hard.	Way adag tahay.
Much really.	Wax badan run ahaantii.
I just want to come back and help.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan soo noqdo oo aan caawiyo.
They are worse than before.	Way ka xun yihiin sidii hore.
He just didn’t want to do it.	Kaliya ma uusan rabin inuu sameeyo.
Everyone else looked surprised as well.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa u muuqday mid la yaabay sidoo kale.
Nice to see you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
I found a long car at home.	Waxaan helay baabuur dheer guriga.
That is what you know.	Taasi waa waxa aad ogaato.
Why do we always do the same?	Maxay tahay sababta aan had iyo jeer u samayno wax la mid ah?
Everyone is happy.	Qof kastaa wuu faraxsan yahay.
I know you are busy.	Waan ogahay inaad mashquul tahay.
Now he could not see.	Hadda wuu arki waayay.
A lot, but not exactly.	Wax badan, laakiin si sax ah maaha.
Much is needed.	Wax badan ayaa loo baahan yahay.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
I just don’t want to.	Kaliya ma rabin.
That is what we are.	Taasi waa waxa aan nahay.
But today is not a good day.	Laakiin maanta maalin wanaagsan maaha.
Something to hold on to	Wax lagu hayo
Sorry, that's the way it is.	Waan ka xumahay, waa sida ay tahay.
Maybe more now than ever.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in hadda ka badan sidii hore.
He wanted to come.	Wuxuu rabay inuu yimaado.
I do not know really.	Ma garanayo runtii.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
What did you do after school yesterday?	Maxaad samaysay dugsiga ka dib shalay?
But I'm not sure if she can do it.	Laakiin ma hubo inay samayn karto iyo in kale.
I know where he can be.	Waan ogahay meesha uu joogi karo.
That he tried again.	In uu mar kale isku dayay.
It has been found.	Waa la helay.
Everyone else does.	Qof kasta oo kale hubaal wuu sameeyaa.
I do not know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
He didn't like that.	Ma uu jeclayn taas.
I don’t think anyone can love me.	Uma maleynayo in qofna i jeclaan karo.
I love you more than ever and even more than ever.	Waxaan kuu jeclahay sidii hore iyo xitaa si ka badan sidii hore.
She picked it up.	Way soo qaaday.
Everyone wants money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa lacag.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kuma eka.
That is what you know.	Taasi waa waxa aad ogaato.
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
It was too, he felt.	Waxay ahayd sidoo kale, wuu dareemay.
It looks the same.	Waxay u egtahay mid la mid ah.
Here is what I will do.	Waa kan waxa aan sameyn doono.
You look so good.	Waxaad u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I can go anywhere	Meel kasta waan aadi karaa
I still can't get there.	Weli halkaas ma tagi karin.
Probably more than once.	Malaha in ka badan hal mar.
I do not want to see	Ma rabo inaan arko
But that is enough now.	Laakiin taas hadda waa ku filan tahay.
Pick me up and give me one.	Soo qaado oo mid i sii.
least when best.	ugu yar marka ugu fiican.
I really am not.	Run ahaantii ma ihi.
badly close.	si xun u dhow.
Maybe that’s all this is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ay tahay wax kasta oo tani ay tahay.
I will always be there for you.	Had iyo jeer waan kuu joogi doonaa adiga.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
Probably three times.	Malaha saddex jeer.
One day, it could be you.	Maalin, waxay noqon kartaa adiga.
What a great job.	Waa maxay shaqo weyn.
But he did not want to.	Laakiin ma uu rabin.
it does nothing.	waxba ma sameeyo.
Something happened	Wax baa dhacay
I think that's really good.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi runtii aad u fiican tahay.
They will find you.	Way ku heli doonaan.
You did the right thing, next.	Waxaad samaysay wax sax ah, soo socda.
But don't do that.	Laakiin taas ha samayn.
Before he left me.	Inta uusan iga tagin.
I will definitely do it.	Dhab ahaantii waan sameyn doonaa.
I'm sorry about everything.	Waan ka xumahay wax walba.
He should have.	Waxay ahayd inuu haysto.
He always told me that.	Mar walba sidaas ayuu ii sheegi jiray.
I have to too.	Waa inaan sidoo kale.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma i caawin karaa.
I did not understand that.	Taas ma fahmin.
Now if you like, great.	Hadda haddii aad jeceshahay, weyn.
And as she said.	Oo sida ay sheegtay.
What do you have to say about that?	maxaad ka leedahay taas?.
But nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale maaha.
She was a man.	Nin bay ahayd.
Maybe she is with us now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay hadda nala jirto.
That would be nice, you know.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd, waad ogtahay.
I thought that was it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi tahay.
More than you can afford.	In badan oo aadan awoodin.
I liked it, a lot.	Waan ka helay, wax badan.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
If he can.	Haddii uu awoodo.
You look beautiful.	Waxaad u egtahay qurux.
Tomorrow would be a day.	Berrito waxay ahaan lahayd maalin.
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
I promise he is fine.	Waxaan ballan qaaday inuu fiican yahay.
They never got it.	Mar dambe ma ay helin.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
I wanted to see myself.	Waxaan rabay inaan is arko.
I just want to leave.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan baxo.
I'm not sure if that is true.	Ma hubo in taasi run tahay.
Everyone needs one.	Dhammaan mid baa u baahan.
I don't like it there.	Ma jecli halkaas.
I will not lie to you now.	Hadda been kuu sheegi maayo.
But don't say anything.	Laakiin waxba ha odhan.
This was something very new.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad ugu cusub.
There was very little time.	Waqti aad u yar baa jiray.
It is close to the door.	Albaabka ayuu u dhow yahay.
I do not understand this.	Ma fahmin tan.
Just so.	Kaliya si.
They make money once.	Mar bay lacag sameeyaan.
I have things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan sameeyo.
Just tell me what you want.	Kaliya ii sheeg waxaad rabto.
It's very difficult, after all.	Waa wax aad u adag, ka dib oo dhan.
You do not have to lie.	Uma baahnid inaad been sheegto.
We would find you	Waan ku heli lahayn
And I have nothing.	Oo waxba ma haysto.
You have one.	Mid baad leedahay.
I will say that.	taas ayaan odhan doonaa.
I found it here	Waan ka helay halkan
And much bigger.	Oo aad uga weyn.
I will get a new job	Waxaan heli doonaa shaqo cusub
I did not become anyone else.	Ma aan noqon qof kale.
we are ready	diyaar ayaan nahay
I love people like that.	Waxaan jeclahay dadka sidaas oo kale ah.
It's a big car.	Waa baabuur weyn.
He seemed familiar.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid la yaqaan.
I did not do it again.	Mar kale ma samayn.
I have to see him.	Waa inaan arko isaga.
Not a great opportunity.	Ma ahan fursad weyn.
That someone was right.	In qof sax ahaa.
Why do you really like someone?	Waa maxay sababta aad dhab ahaantii qof u jeceshahay
He lives in it.	Wuu ku nool yahay.
I will be much better now.	Hadda aad baan u fiicnaan doonaa.
You can tell me the truth.	Run baad ii sheegi kartaa.
I can't say it's true.	Ma sheegi karo inay run tahay.
And it is very good.	Oo aad bay u fiican tahay.
How that was done.	Sida in sidaas loo sameeyay.
All in all.	Dhammaan wax walba.
Whatever he had, he did not want to say.	Wax kasta oo uu lahaa, ma uusan rabin inuu sheego.
I left a lot.	Wax badan baan ka tagay.
She loves me.	Way i jeceshahay.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
Maybe he can find something for me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax i heli karo.
It will not do.	Ma yeeli doonto.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
I hope to be whatever he wants.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqdo wax walba oo uu doonayo.
I have already fallen.	Hore ayaan u dhacay.
tell me how you like it.	ii sheeg sida aad u jeceshahay.
But you can see.	Laakiin waad arki kartaa.
I'll tell you one day.	Maalin baan kuu sheegi doonaa.
I don't feel anything.	Waxba ma dareemayo.
It would come at a good time.	Waxay iman lahayd waqti fiican.
Maybe it was still not.	Ma laga yaabaa inay weli ahayd.
To speak.	Si loo hadlo.
I don't care.	Waxba kuma hayo.
He loves to be there.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu halkaas joogo.
As he had seen before.	Sida uu hore u arkay.
I went	Waa baxay
It cannot be done.	Lama samayn karo.
But still each one clearly.	Laakiin weli mid kasta si cad.
He wanted to do the same.	Rabay in uu sidaas oo kale sameeyo.
I will talk to him.	Waan la hadli doonaa isaga.
Can someone please help me?	Qof fadlan ma i caawin karaa.
There are many.	Waxaa jira badan.
This, and nothing else.	Tani, iyo wax kale ma jiraan.
A long time ago.	Muddo dheer ka hor.
But that is not what happened here.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa halkan ka dhacay.
He would go.	Wuu tagi lahaa.
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
No one likes him.	Qofna ma jecla isaga.
I will talk to you soon.	Dhawaan ayaan la hadli doonaa.
Bad place.	Meel xun.
Obviously, it was a problem.	Sida cad, waxay ahayd dhibaato.
That was not even mentioned.	Taas xitaa lama sheegin.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas.
He told me he would not give me any money.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aanu wax lacag ah i siin doonin.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
But that is past and present.	Laakiin taasi waa hore iyo hadda.
I knew it had to be small.	Waan ogaa inay tahay inay yar tahay.
He said he heard it.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu maqlay.
But me.	Laakiin aniga.
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxaan sameeyo.
But, now, they could not do anything.	Laakiin, hadda, waxba ma ay qaban karin.
What really happened.	Maxaa dhacay runtii.
I don’t want anyone to know, really.	Ma rabo in qofna ogaado, dhab ahaantii.
No food	Cunto lama siin
A strange man appeared at the door.	Waxaa albaabka ka soo muuqday nin yaab leh.
We get it that way.	Waxaan sidaas ku heli.
Very good thing.	Wax aad u wanaagsan.
I still need you.	Wali waan kuu baahanahay.
The whole house.	Guriga oo dhan.
Sorry to come back with you too late.	Waan ka xumahay inaan kula soo noqdo goor dambe.
That is the best.	Taasi waa waxa ugu fiican.
But I see.	Laakiin aan arko .
Now.	Hadda  .
He was really amazing.	Runtii wuxuu ahaa qof la yaab leh.
I am very happy to help.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan i caawiyo.
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
The people who live there are.	Dadka halkaas ku nool ayaa ah.
Very interesting.	Aad u xiiso badan.
It may not even exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan xitaa jirin.
False, not.	Been, maaha.
I was taken a little.	Wax yar baa la iga qaaday.
He is really good.	Runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I thought it was very good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u fiican tahay.
Very well done.	Aad u wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
Maybe very little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u yar.
Great idea really.	Fikrad fiican runtii.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
He promised me not to mention.	Waxa uu ii ballan qaaday in aanan sheegin.
You can do something about it.	Waad wax ka qaban kartaa taas.
I will do that if you want me to do so.	Taas waan samayn doonaa haddii aad rabto inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I think it's amazing.	Waxay ila tahay yaab.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I can't be smart.	Ma noqon karo caqli badan.
I went to help.	Waxaan u aaday inaan caawiyo.
I spent time there.	Waqti ayaan halkaas ku qaatay.
I hope you like it !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay!.
I picked one up.	Mid baan soo qaaday.
tell me why you are here	ii sheeg sababta aad halkan u joogto
Who is it.	Waa kuma.
I just say what it was.	Kaliya waxaan leeyahay maxaa ahaa.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
More is needed.	Waxaa loo baahan yahay in badan.
For a long time, too.	Muddo dheer, sidoo kale.
It was tough most of the time.	Waxay ahayd mid adag inta badan.
I do not want to be here.	Ma doonayo inaan halkan joogo.
Too much for everyone.	Aad iyo aad u badan qof walba.
Maybe that’s what happened here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay taasi tahay waxa halkan ka dhacay.
You can't say anything.	Waxba ma odhan kartid.
She is beautiful and loving.	Waa qurux badan oo jecel.
It should not have been held.	Ma ahayn in la haysto.
That’s pretty much what it was.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan waxa ay ahayd.
you are right.	sax baad tahay.
I am everything, it was said.	Waxaan ahay wax walba, ayaa la yidhi.
I think someone else said it well.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof kale uu yiri si fiican.
It was for me, for me.	Waxay ii ahayd, aniga.
Get a new car.	Qaado baabuur cusub.
This is not a bad thing.	Tani maaha wax xun.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
A lot	Wax badan
He looked so good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u fiican.
But I really didn’t take it seriously.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii si dhab ah uma qaadan.
That was taken from me.	Taas waa la iga qaatay.
Somehow, it was.	Si ahaan, waxay ahayd.
Even more so.	Xitaa ka sii badan.
You can get it.	Waad heli kartaa.
I'm sure that	Waxaan hubaa in
Little needs to be said.	Wax yar ayaa loo baahan yahay in la sheego.
But there was still something else to come.	Laakiin waxaa jiray weli wax kale oo soo socda.
He never wanted to be.	Waligiis ma uusan rabin inuu noqdo.
All she said was that she would find me.	Waxa ay tidhi oo dhan waa in ay i heli doonto.
I think she is smart.	Waxaan filayaa inay caqli badan tahay.
I got nothing better.	Wax ka fiican ma helin.
But that is the best thing we can do now.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa ugu fiican ee aan hadda sameyn karno.
So should you.	Sidaas oo kale waa in aad.
I did not want to	Maan rabin
I have to see you	waa inaan ku arko
Same, correct, three.	Isku mid, sax, saddex.
Probably before.	Waxay u badan tahay in hadda ka hor.
That is better.	Taas ayaa ka fiican.
I can't go to him.	Ma aadi karo isaga.
I know, smart.	Waan ogahay, caqli badan.
Maybe we can go there a little more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan halkaas aadi karno in yar oo badan.
He said it would take time.	Waxa uu yidhi wakhti ayaan qaadan doonaa.
I don't want to	ma rabo
First, the house.	Marka hore, guriga.
To be done quickly.	In si degdeg ah loo sameeyo.
Probably not.	Malaha maaha.
That is so beautiful.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn kartid.
Not sure about everything.	Wax walba ma hubo.
It's more than that here.	Way ka sii badan tahay halkan.
He does not want to come.	Ma rabo inuu yimaado.
I really am.	run ahaantii waxaan ahay .
No one gets money to stay here and help.	Qofna ma helo lacag si uu halkan u joogo oo uu u caawiyo.
That really is true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
He must be happy.	Waa inuu faraxsan yahay.
This is true today more than ever.	Tani waa run maanta in ka badan sidii hore.
I saw something else.	Wax kale ayaan arkay.
But they are not.	Laakiin ma jiraan.
It was something they could not even imagine.	Waxay ahayd wax aanay xitaa malayn karin.
I can no longer speak.	Mar dambe ma hadli karo.
It will be here.	Waxay ahaan doontaa halkan.
I didn't think he would tell me.	Uma malaynayn inuu ii sheegi doono.
You know what will happen.	Waad ogtahay waxa dhici doona.
I really know this.	Runtii waan ogahay tan.
More to learn, less time.	Wax badan in la barto, waqti aad u yar.
It is a part of the house.	Waa meel guriga ka mid ah.
I think she does.	Waxaan filayaa inay sameyso.
You do not have to do this.	Ma aha inaad tan sameyso.
Definitely more than a few.	Dhab ahaantii in ka badan dhowr.
I think that is a problem.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhibaato tahay.
He was surprised.	Waa uu yaabay.
No one will believe you.	Qofna kuma rumaysan doono.
Someone else did too.	Qof kale ayaa sidoo kale.
The former can be done.	Tan hore ayaa loo samayn karaa.
Nothing is going on.	Wax socda ma jiraan.
Not what it is.	Ma aha waxa lagu yaqaan.
You just can't do anything.	Kaliya waxba kuma samayn kartid.
She was right.	Sax bay ahayd.
No wonder no one likes him.	La yaab ma leh qofna ma jecla isaga.
But it has to be done !.	Laakiin waa in la sameeyaa!.
That was what I wanted from him.	Taas ayaan la rabay isaga.
There is no one like him.	Ma jiro mid isaga la mid ah.
It's like this.	Waa sida tan.
It was good to know.	Waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan in la ogaado.
Give it to him.	Sii isaga.
Someone wanted to know something.	Qof ayaa rabay inuu wax ogaado.
I have a lot to say.	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan sheego.
I was not ready for this.	Anigu diyaar uma ahayn tan.
you did not come.	ma aadan iman.
It was a difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti adag.
I really didn't do much.	Runtii wax badan maan qaban.
Permanent	Joogto ah
But you can see a lot.	Laakiin wax badan ayaad arki kartaa.
What the least.	Maxaa ugu yar.
Each one.	Mid walba.
That was a lie, too.	Taasi waxay ahayd been, sidoo kale.
People, me.	Dadka, aniga.
I don't have to.	Ma aha inaan.
There was no surprise.	Wax la yaab leh ma jirin.
But it really is more than that.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii way ka badan tahay taas.
Good day.	Maalin wanaagsan.
Just something else.	Kaliya wax kale.
To be present.	Inuu la joogo.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
I told him it would happen.	Waxaan u sheegay inay dhici doonto.
I hope !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa!.
It was not a more beautiful place.	Ma ahayn meel ka qurux badan.
I wonder if this will happen anytime soon.	Waxaan la yaabanahay in tani ay noqon doonto mar dhow.
He was someone else.	Wuxuu ahaa qof kale.
Everywhere he went.	Meel walba wuu la baxay.
I do not want to, obviously.	Ma rabto, sida cad.
I am very sorry about that.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas.
She told us what she did.	Waxay noo sheegtay waxay samaysay.
It is here now.	Waa halkan hadda.
I had a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay.
He said he would love to see if he could.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu jeclaan lahaa inuu arko haddii uu awoodo.
This is obvious.	Tani waa wax iska cad.
One was that he was feeling better.	Mid waxay ahayd inuu dareemayo fiicnaan.
.	.
It has been reported.	Waa la sheegay.
Less than the best.	In ka yar kan ugu fiican.
Today it is true.	Maanta waa run.
I don't know what to do here.	Ma garanayo waxaan halkan ka sameeyo.
I do not want to do that again.	Ma doonayo in aan taas mar kale sameeyo.
The time has come.	Waqti ku yimid.
I do not know how to do that.	Ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo taas.
You will tell him that you love him.	Waxaad u sheegi doontaa inaad jeceshahay isaga.
This is enough for me.	Tani waa igu filan tahay aniga.
There is no place like it.	Ma jirto meel sidaas oo kale ah.
He was, he is.	Wuxuu ahaa, waa uu yahay.
This can be done quickly.	Tani si degdeg ah ayaa loo samayn karaa.
I just want to know where it came from.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado meesha uu ka yimid.
Someone did this to me a long time ago.	Qof ayaa tan ii sameeyay wakhti dheer ka hor.
I got a very good idea.	Waxaan helay fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
That's right here.	Waa sax halkan.
He refused.	Wuu iska diiday.
I know it looks amazing.	Waan ogahay in ay u egtahay wax yaab leh.
He heard.	Wuu maqlay.
It was definitely a lot of fun.	Hubaal waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
How fun!	Sidee xiiso leh!
Maybe he really was.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu dhab ahaa.
But they do.	Laakiin way sameeyaan.
There was nothing else to do.	Ma jirin wax kale oo la sameeyo.
I have to leave.	Aniga ayaa ah in aan baxo.
I had one.	Mid baan lahaa.
Maybe he did.	Malaha wuu sameeyay.
I can't stay that long anymore.	Ma sii joogi karo in dambe.
I would really like to see someone new.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko qof cusub.
Now it was nothing.	Hadda waxba ma ahayn.
We would not do that.	Ma yeeli lahayn taas.
He could not find it.	Waa uu heli waayay.
I got into some trouble.	Waxaan galay xoogaa dhib ah.
Another had.	Mid kale ayaa lahaa.
But there was no time.	Laakiin ma jirin waqti.
But he wanted to know.	Laakiin wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado.
But she was unable to do so.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday inay samayso.
I heard him.	Waan maqlay isaga.
I'm sorry, he said.	Waan ka xumahay, ayuu yidhi.
It may not be early.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan ahayn hore.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I do not see any problem.	Wax dhib ah uma arko.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
Until it was.	Ilaa ay ahayd.
I expect a lot.	Wax badan ayaan filayaa.
This is an opportunity.	Tani waa fursad.
But maybe you should take it seriously ?.	Laakiin ma laga yaabaa in aad si dhab ah u qaadan?.
It's like new.	Waa sida cusub.
Do this.	Ha samayso tan.
He is just a man.	Waa nin kaliya.
You can do this anywhere.	Waxaad tan ka samayn kartaa meel kasta.
She had no idea how she found out.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan sida ay tan ku ogaatay.
This is not a new problem.	Tani maaha dhibaato cusub.
Like me, today.	Aniga oo kale, maanta.
It felt fast	Waxa la dareemay degdeg
I had to find out more.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan ogaado.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
I had to be with someone.	Waxay ahayd inaan qof la joogo.
You say you can't get it.	Waxaad leedahay ma heli kartid.
I would not stay	Maan joogi lahayn
I don't want to see what's going on there.	Ma rabo inaan arko waxa halkaas ka jira.
I can't believe otherwise.	Si kale ma rumaysan karo.
And really happy.	Oo runtii faraxsan.
She was very ready.	Aad bay diyaar u ahayd.
He does other things first.	Waxyaabo kale ayuu sameeyaa marka hore.
Not there.	Ma aha halkaas.
I don't know, maybe it was something she could do.	Ma garanayo, malaha waxay ahayd wax ay samayn karto.
You can't stop something like that.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma joojin kartid.
I want him.	isaga ayaan rabaa.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
Everyone.	Qof walba.
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
He refused to come.	Wuu diiday inuu yimaado.
Please? 	Fadlan?
Please take it	Fadlan qaado
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
what is that	waa maxay taasi?
That is what got me.	Taasi waa waxa i helay.
There is little or no more.	Wax yar iyo wax ka badan ma jiraan.
He does not want to talk.	Ma rabo inuu hadlo.
He said something, she said something.	Wax buu yidhi, wax bay tidhi.
He knows.	Wuu garanayaa.
She had no food.	Cunto ma ay haysan.
You will love it	Waad jeclaan doontaa
I think it is very good so far.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u fiican tahay ilaa hadda.
This is not correct	Tani sax uma eka
He would help me.	Wuu i caawin lahaa.
And before.	Iyo ka hor.
I saw this.	Waxaan arkay tan.
I really like you a bit.	Runtii waan ku jeclahay xoogaa.
John enters the house through the back door.	Yooxanaa wuxuu guriga ka soo galay albaabka dambe.
That was the only time.	Taasi waxay ahayd markii kaliya.
He had a lot, too.	Wuxuu lahaa wax badan, sidoo kale.
I must know.	Waa inaan ogahay.
Maybe not you but me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan adiga ahayn laakiin aniga.
You said.	Adiga ayaa sheegay.
I will not do this again.	Mar dambe tan ma samayn doono.
I had a very bad day.	Waxaan lahaa maalin aad u xun.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
Not only that.	Ma aha oo kaliya.
I did not get that.	Taas maan helin.
I have nothing	waxba ma hayo
I can't think of a problem.	Dhib uma malayn karo.
This will not do.	Tani ma yeeli doonto.
Maybe another time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waqti kale.
It took a long time.	Wuxuu qaatay waqti dheer.
They looked at each other.	Waa la is eegay.
It should not have been said.	Ma ahayn in la sheego.
No one did.	Qofna ma samayn.
I did not know they were there.	Maan ogayn inay meesha ku jiraan.
This is difficult.	Tani waa mid adag.
You do not need it now.	Uma baahnid hadda.
It was great, he said.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn, ayuu yidhi.
I am with you.	taas waan kula joogaa.
Why he refused, is hard to say.	Waa maxay sababta uu u diiday, way adag tahay in la sheego.
I have a lot for you today.	Wax badan ayaan kuu hayaa maanta.
This will be a real thing.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa wax dhab ah.
Things were not true.	Waxyaabo run ma ahayn.
This is an amazing place.	Tani waa meel yaab leh.
He came from.	Waxa uu ka yimid.
Why he.	Waa maxay sababta uu.
I am still like that.	Weli sidaas ayaan ahay.
I do not want to see anything.	Ma rabo inaan wax arko.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I think we should do this together.	Waxay ila tahay in aan tan wada samayno.
I just do not know.	Kaliya ma garanayo.
It's so bad.	Waa sidaas u xun.
I don't want to.	Ima rabto.
He told you to tell me.	Wuxuu kuu sheegay si aad ii sheegto.
Don't tell me.	Ha ii sheegin.
Took me.	I qaaday.
There was no way to tell.	Ma jirin si loo sheego.
It is too long.	Aad bay u dheer tahay.
Do you think you can help me with this.	Ma u malaynaysaa inaad tan iga caawin karto.
Not good.	Wax wanaagsan maaha.
He is still alive.	Wali waa nool yahay.
Good job if you can get it.	Shaqo fiican haddii aad heli karto.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
It is indeed a very good time.	Runtii waa wakhti aad u wanaagsan.
I will not do anything like that.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma yeeli doono.
This is true.	Tani waa dhab.
We were found.	Waa nala helay.
After tomorrow.	Berri ka dib.
He is a good friend.	Waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
That is everything.	Taasi waa wax walba.
It really is so for me.	Runtii waa sidaas aniga.
Everyone got really, really good.	Qof kastaa wuxuu helay runtii, runtii si fiican.
That is not for me.	Taasi aniga maaha.
Tell me what you told me!	U sheeg waxaad ii sheegtay!
They do not do it here.	Halkan ma sameeyaan.
It felt great today.	Waxaa la dareemay maanta si weyn.
This is so.	Tani waa sidaas oo kale.
I am one of them.	Anigu waxaan ka mid ahay.
You can say it is you.	Waxaad odhan kartaa waa adiga.
Let him do what he wants.	Ha sameeyo wuxuu rabo.
I will get a job tomorrow, he said.	Berri ayaan shaqo heli doonaa, ayuu yidhi.
And still nothing.	Oo weli waxba.
More, more.	Waxyaabo badan, badan.
And, that's a good thing.	Iyo, taasi waa wax fiican.
You don't need it anymore.	Uma baahnid mar dambe.
Maybe that's fine.	Malaha taasi way fiican tahay.
He found himself doing more and more.	Waxa uu is arkay in uu samaynayo in ka badan iyo in ka badan.
In fact, it's hard, for a while.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu adag yahay, muddo.
It was bad.	Mid xun buu ahaa.
As much as everywhere.	Sida ugu badan meel kasta.
It did not end there.	Halkaas kuma ay dhammaan.
Everything is there.	Wax kasta oo jira.
How did he do it?	Sidee buu u sameeyay?
Tomorrow is a long day.	Berri waa maalin dheer.
Not as it was.	Ma aha sidii ay ahayd.
He was so bad when he came in.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u xun markii uu soo galay.
You can not come	Ma iman kartid
He had a problem.	Dhib buu lahaa.
What, he did not know.	Waa maxay, ma uu ogayn.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
And maybe not.	Oo malaha maaha.
And very popular.	Oo aad loo jecel yahay.
Out of there.	Ka soo baxay halkaas.
Everyone is clear.	Qof walba waa cad yahay.
Not at all.	Maaha.
I will still do.	Wali waan yeeli doonaa.
What can you see there? 	Maxaad ka arki kartaa halkaas?
As a matter of fact.	Sida ay dhab tahay.
I left nothing.	Waxba kama tagin.
I was surprised to see you here.	Waxaan la yaabay inaan halkan kugu arko.
He is a tough guy.	Waa nin adag.
He said he did not know why he did it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu garanayn sababta uu u sameeyay.
You are good to me, you know.	Waad ii fiican tahay, waad ogtahay.
He said nothing.	Waxba kuma uu odhan.
You can see a lot.	Wax badan ayaad arki kartaa.
I don't know what to do now.	Ma garanayo waxaan ku sameeyo hadda.
I just have no idea where to leave here.	Kaliya ma hayo wax fikrad ah meesha aan ka tago halkan.
I did nothing.	waxba maan samayn.
That is actually a bit more difficult.	Taasi dhab ahaantii way ka yara adag tahay.
There must be something.	Waa in ay jiraan wax.
It was an interesting idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad xiiso leh.
It is yours if you wish.	Adiga ayaa iska leh haddii aad rabto.
I am the person you should be with.	Anigu waxaan ahay qofka ay tahay inaad la joogto.
He took it.	Wuu u qaaday.
That's what he does.	Waa waxa uu sameeyo.
You know, though you don't think you do.	Waad ogtahay, in kasta oo aadan u malaynayn inaad samaynayso.
And what is one.	Oo waa maxay mid ka mid ah.
I found a lot of interesting things.	Waxaan helay waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh.
Correct me.	Sax aniga.
We would not say anything bad to anyone.	Qofna uma sheegi lahayn wax xun.
He will not leave.	Ma bixi doono.
What else do you think.	Maxaad u malaynaysaa wax kale.
Lots of money.	Lacag badan.
Not much to say.	Ma aha wax badan oo la sheego.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Qof kastaa uma maleynayo in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
That is so beautiful what happened.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan wixii dhacay.
I am a loving person.	Waxaan ahay qof jecel.
I will be fine now.	Hadda waan fiicnaan doonaa.
I looked at it.	Waan ka eegay.
It really looks like it could be real.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay inay dhab noqon karto.
She told us.	Waxay noo sheegtay.
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
And now it was here.	Oo hadda waxay ahayd halkan.
And not just one, many.	Oo maaha mid kaliya, badan.
I tried to figure out how it was done.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado sida loo sameeyay.
I love the other one.	Jeclahay kan kale.
I was in a bad mood.	Waxaan ku jiray si xun.
I lied.	been baan dhigay.
Everyone knew the most.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa waxa ugu badan.
Very good for him.	Aad u fiican isaga.
I don't have much money.	Lacag badan ma haysto.
I had to work.	Waxay ahayd inaan shaqeeyo.
A little worse.	Qof yar oo ka xun.
This will be a problem.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa dhibaato.
It is really beautiful	Runtii waa qurux
I want to get to know you better.	Waxaan rabaa in aan si fiican kuu barto.
You are the best.	Adiga ayaa ugu fiican.
To say what he says.	Si uu u sheego waxa uu leeyahay.
"I am ready," he said.	diyaar ayaan ahay ayuu yidhi.
But it is everywhere.	Laakiin waa meel walba.
It was found.	Waa la helay.
I think you will love it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto.
Everything is ready.	Wax walba waa u diyaar.
That's how bad it is.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun tahay.
Good day.	Maalin wanaagsan.
I wondered how long it would take.	Waxaan la yaabay inta ay qaadan doonto.
Now is the time I need it.	Hadda waa markii aan u baahanahay.
But obviously over time, he says.	Laakiin si cad waqti ka dib, wuxuu leeyahay.
You told me she thought everything was yours.	Waxaad ii sheegtay inay wax walba adiga kula tahay.
He should have been able to help.	Waxay ahayd inuu awoodo inuu caawiyo.
To be present.	Inuu la joogo.
Not everyone can speak.	Qof walba uma hadli karo.
I have nothing to do.	Wax aan sameeyo ma hayo.
He may tell the room.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sheego qolka.
He is here with the rest.	Halkan ayuu nala joogaa inta kale.
That would be correct.	Taasi sax bay ahaan lahayd.
You would be a new man.	Waxaad soo noqon lahayd nin cusub.
I am happy to be back.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan soo noqdo.
He must have one.	Waa inuu mid leeyahay.
It was more than she said.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan sida ay u tidhi.
Don't talk like that.	Ha u hadlin sidaas.
Now I am back home.	Hadda ayaan ku soo noqday guriga.
Everyone wants to help him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu caawiyo isaga.
It is very difficult to make money.	Aad bay u adag tahay in lacag la helo.
Not sure how to do it.	Ma hubo sida loo sameeyo.
But, this is not known.	Laakiin, tani lama garanayo.
It's a little bit.	Waa wax yar.
I will say it again.	Mar kale ayaan odhan doonaa.
Please take what you need.	Fadlan qaado waxaad u baahan tahay.
It has always been very good.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I love you, you love me.	Waan ku jeclahay, waad i jeceshahay.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
And it will not take long.	Oo wakhti badan kuma qaadan doonto.
This did not end well.	Tani si fiican uma dhammaan.
I need to buy more things.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan soo iibsado waxyaabo badan.
They just exist.	Kaliya inay jiraan.
She had no problem being with him.	Wax dhib ah kuma lahayn haddii ay isaga la joogto.
That is the other way around.	Taasi waa tan kale.
Many other things have been done.	Waxyaabo badan oo kale ayaa la sameeyay.
Not sure how to do it.	Ma hubo sida aad u samaynayso.
Don't believe that.	Ha rumaysan taas.
Not sure about you.	Ma hubo adiga.
He did what he did.	Wuu sameeyay wixii uu sameeyay.
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
Obviously they will.	Sida cad waxay doonaan.
I know this is true.	Waxaan ogahay inay tani run tahay.
He had a lot.	Wax badan buu lahaa.
But more can be done.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa la qaban karaa.
He should not have told her.	Ma ahayn inuu u sheego.
Maybe she missed it.	Malaha way wayday.
Can anyone help me?	Qofna ma i caawin karaa?
But a long time was given.	Laakiin waqti dheer ayaa la siiyay.
She told me so.	Waxay igu tidhi sidaas.
Interesting, but there is still a problem.	Xiiso leh, laakiin weli waxaa jira wax dhibaato ah.
You only need to do it once.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso hal mar kaliya.
I am here	halkaan ayaan joogaa
Not enough for you.	In kugu filan dib uma noqon.
And he wanted to do it right.	Oo wuxuu rabay inuu si sax ah u sameeyo.
It's true.	Waa run.
She did not want to be seen.	Ma ay rabin in la arko.
Everyone wants to be the best.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu noqdo kan ugu fiican.
For me.	Aniga ahaan.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
It was very difficult to keep him there.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u adag inuu halkaas ku haysto.
Now he has bought a new car.	Hadda ayuu soo iibsaday baabuur cusub.
That is not all.	Taasi kaliya maaha.
Now he felt better.	Hadda waxa uu dareemay fiicnaan.
Hold on tight!	Si adag u qabo!
He went to work yesterday.	Shalay ayuu u shaqo tagay.
This is definitely true.	Tani hubaal waa sax.
Much better than he thought.	Wax badan oo ka fiican sidii uu u malayn lahaa.
What is it.	Waa maxay.
I didn’t know what to do all the time.	Ma garanayn in la sameeyo mar kasta.
Nothing bad will happen to you.	Wax xun kugu dhici maayo.
It was not, once.	Ma aysan ahayn, hal mar.
It's great, really.	Aad bay u fiican tahay, runtii.
If you were him, what would you do?	Haddii aad isaga ahaan lahayd, maxaad samayn lahayd?
They should not have anything better to do.	Waa inaysan haysan wax ka fiican oo ay sameeyaan.
I knew he didn't really believe me, but that's right.	Waan ogaa inuusan run ahaantii i rumaysan, laakiin taasi waa sax.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I am not you.	Anigu adiga ma ihi.
He is coming.	Waa iman.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
He asked why.	Sababta ayuu waydiiyay.
I will tell you.	waan kuu sheegi doonaa.
There are many other things as well.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo badan sidoo kale.
They are long.	Way dheer yihiin.
He wanted to say more.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax badan sheego.
I could not see.	Maan arki karin.
I would get enough of it	Waan heli lahaa wax igu filan
You are much smaller.	In badan ayaa kaa yar.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
But we were not.	Laakiin waxaan ahayn.
I can't talk about it tonight.	Ma ka hadli karo caawa.
I can see it there.	Halkaas ayaan ku arki karaa.
But, he likes to talk a lot.	Laakiin, wax badan ayuu jecel yahay in la hadlo.
Not that this is a bad thing.	Ma aha in tani ay tahay wax xun.
What you want.	Wixii aad rabto.
We would get more.	Wax badan ayaan heli lahayn.
Maybe I can tell you too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale kuu sheego.
He looked good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid fiican.
It’s how people are.	Waa sida ay tahay dadka.
You can come back	Dib ayaad ugu soo noqon kartaa
If this.	Haddii tani.
That is what everyone had.	Taasi waa waxa qof walba lahaa.
I can't do it now.	Ma awoodo hadda.
Not like everyone else.	Ma aha sida dadka kale.
I no longer have it.	Aan mar dambe haysan.
But that is nonsense.	Laakiin taasi waa wax aan jirin.
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax weyn.
There is no place like home.	Ma jirto meel guriga la mid ah.
Everyone can talk.	Qof kastaa wuu hadli karaa.
It was uninteresting.	Waxay ahayd mid aan xiiso lahayn.
There are a few things they can’t do.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo aysan sameyn karin.
Everyone loves it !.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay!.
I want you to know.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato.
I want that too bad.	Waxaan rabaa taas aad u xun.
She did not stay home for a day.	Hal maalin ma aysan joogin guriga.
One of us said.	Mid naga mid ah ayuu yidhi.
But she doesn't want to tell me anything else.	Laakiin ma rabto inay wax kale ii sheegto.
But no one knows.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo.
I made one first to see how it looks.	Mid baan sameeyay marka hore si aan u arko sida ay tahay.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in hal maalin, laakiin aan weli.
He would love to.	Wuu jeclaan lahaa.
I got several jobs.	Waxaan helay dhowr shaqo.
You know you want it.	Waad ogtahay inaad rabto.
He tried something else.	Wax kale ayuu isku dayay.
It won't be long.	Waqti dheer ma bixi doono.
I will not do that.	Anigu taas yeeli maayo.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
You can do anything else.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo kale.
But now it does not end there.	Laakiin hadda halkaas kuma dhammaan.
I would definitely not be here again.	Hubaal ma joogi lahaa mar kale.
The reason I lost.	Sababta waan waayay.
I hear something almost every day.	Waxaan maqlay wax ku dhow maalin kasta.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
She would not leave him.	Ma ay ka tagi lahayn isaga.
Now I began to see why.	Hadda waxaan bilaabay inaan arko sababta.
More than three.	In ka badan sida saddex.
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
I will not stay here	Ma joogi doono halkan
I did not find it	Ma helin
It 's great to have him here.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay inuu halkan ku haysto.
Even after everything happened.	Xitaa ka dib wax walba oo dhacay.
Here is what happened.	Waa kan waxa dhacay.
They are bigger than that.	Way ka weyn yihiin taas.
She told him it was enough.	Waxay u sheegtay inay ku filan tahay.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
Not sure what it is.	Ma hubo waxa jira.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I need to work fast.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan si degdeg ah u shaqeeyo.
That will take a very long time.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
You have done me wrong.	Wax xun baad igu samaysay.
I was not in a position to do anything else.	Maan joogin meel aan wax kale sameeyo.
But this is worse.	Laakiin tani way ka xun tahay.
For me, this is even better.	Aniga ahaan, tani way ka sii fiican tahay.
He will get something to do.	Wuxuu heli doonaa wax uu sameeyo.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ilaa hadda qofna ma arag.
Even bigger than before.	Xitaa ka sii weyn sidii hore.
Let him speak.	Ha hadlo.
But no one seems to care.	Laakiin qofna uma eka inuu wax ka qabo.
It is a difficult place.	Waa meel adag.
Maybe she was right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax ahayd.
He was a very handsome man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u qurux badan.
It will not be urgent.	Degdeg ma noqon doonto.
I have never been like that.	Weligay sidaas maan noqon.
He needs to eat.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu cunto cuno.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
He still felt it.	Weli wuu dareemay.
Still, it will.	Weli, way yeeli doontaa.
I would like to know more about the place.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado meesha.
It would be nice tonight.	Caawa way fiicnaan lahayd.
Every day it was.	Maalin kasta waxay ahayd.
Maybe he does.	Malaha wuu sameeyaa.
He did not speak much.	In badan ma uusan hadlin.
You had him very close.	Waxaad lahayd isaga oo aad u dhow.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
I do not know anyone like that.	Anigu ma garanayo qof sidaas oo kale ah.
And probably the best that he does not.	Iyo malaha ugu fiican in uusan samayn.
Which you can do.	Taas oo aad samayn karto.
Someone may have taken a small chance.	Qof baa laga yaabaa inuu fursad yar ka qaatay.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan hadda tago.
But there was not enough work for everyone who came.	Laakiin ma jirin shaqo ku filan qof kasta oo yimid.
Then we will talk again.	Ka dib waan wada hadli doonaa mar kale.
Only first.	Kaliya marka hore.
What happened is interesting.	Waxa dhacay waa mid xiiso leh.
I don't know why really.	Ma garanayo sababta runtii.
Let me help.	Aan caawiyo.
Something else was unthinkable.	Wax kale ayaa ahaa wax aan la malayn karin.
So far she has not seen anyone else.	Ilaa hadda ma ay arag qof kale.
This may be new.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid cusub.
If you can get one.	Haddii aad mid heli karto.
He is here tonight.	Caawa wuu joogaa.
You think so.	Aad baad u malaynaysaa.
That is not what it says.	Taasi maaha waxa ay leedahay.
I don't have that.	Anigu taas ma hayo.
I need to do this for everyone.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan qof walba u sameeyo.
He will do evil.	Wax xun buu samayn doonaa.
Exactly too.	Si sax ah sidoo kale.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I think this is true.	Waxaan filayaa in tani run tahay.
What it looks like when done.	Sida ay u egtahay marka la sameeyo.
I can cook	Waan karin karaa
They are good at that.	Way ku fiican yihiin taas.
He will not dare to lie to me.	Kuma dhici doono inuu been ii sheego.
I am as.	Waxaan u joogaa sidii.
She is really beautiful.	Dhab ahaantii way qurux badan tahay.
Now I know very well.	Hadda si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
It would definitely come back.	Hubaal soo noqon lahaa.
I tried to tell him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u sheego.
I'm just at work	Kaliya waxaan ku jiraa shaqo
That was, really.	Taasi waxay ahayd, runtii.
Very good indeed.	Aad u fiican runtii.
It is not a lie.	Been maaha.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
Really, really good.	Runtii, runtii aad u wanaagsan.
I have never been.	Weligay maan ahayn.
Before.	Ka hor.
Something has returned.	Wax ayaa soo noqday.
You love me!	Waad i jeceshahay!
Sure, that sounds really good.	Hubaal, taasi runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
I will get one	mid ayaan heli doonaa
Unfortunately, not yet.	Nasiib ma leh, weli.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
He left immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayuu uga baxay.
I have nothing against it.	Wax ka dhan ah ma hayo.
No one else can do it.	Qof kale ma samayn karo.
Of course even this is not obvious.	Dhab ahaantii xitaa tani maaha mid iska cad.
He would not say why.	Ma uu odhan lahaa sababta.
I don't think I can stop.	Uma eka inaan joojin karo.
Really?	Runtii?
did not see	ma arag
It was a long day, he said.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer, ayuu yidhi.
I will find him.	Waan heli doonaa isaga.
This one did not.	Tani mid ma lahayn.
He should be at home now.	Waa inuu hadda guriga joogo.
Definitely not going to happen anymore.	Hubaal in aanay sii dhici karin.
Not that he started much.	Ma aha in uu wax badan ka bilaabay.
Not too big.	Aad uma weyn.
It is a done thing.	Waa wax la sameeyay.
He’s a friend of yours, too, you know.	Waa saaxiib adiga, sidoo kale, waad ogtahay.
He does everything well.	Wax walba si fiican ayuu u sameeyaa.
I felt left out.	Waxaan dareemay in taas laga tagay.
I love you so much.	Aad ayaan kuu jeclahay.
I had to know that they would find me again.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inay mar kale i heli doonaan.
No one wanted to.	Qofna ma rabin.
He looked around the room, but saw nothing.	Wuxuu eegay qolka oo dhan, laakiin waxba ma arag.
Do not leave anything out.	Waxba ha ka tagin.
Maybe for you, it can happen.	Malaha adiga, wuu dhici karaa.
That is really hard.	Taasi dhab ahaantii aad bay u adag tahay.
That is why he is here.	Taasi waa sababta uu halkan u joogo.
You should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaad ogaato.
It will be fine so.	Way fiicnaan doontaa sidaas.
But he did not say so.	Laakiin sidaas ma uu odhan.
I look forward to talking to you again soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale kula hadlo dhawaan.
You can say that.	Waad sheegi kartaa taas.
He does not have to do much.	Ma aha inuu wax badan qaban karo.
I could not.	Ma awoodin.
It was done quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaa loo sameeyay.
Just so and.	Kaliya sidaas iyo.
Otherwise it will be.	Haddii kale way ahaan doontaa.
What he heard he could not believe.	Waxa uu maqlay waa uu rumaysan waayay.
Not all.	Ma dhammaan.
I think it's a very good thing.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax aad u wanaagsan.
Anyone with the same problem	Qof kasta oo isku dhib ah
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I have no idea how to make one of these.	Ma hayo wax fikrad ah sida loo sameeyo mid ka mid ah kan.
Still, too.	Weli, sidoo kale.
Everything is new.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin.
She loves him very much.	Aad bay u jeceshahay isaga.
It does not look like anyone.	Qofna uma eka.
You did not understand this at first.	Tan markii hore ma aadan fahmin.
This is what we live for.	Tani waa waxa aan u nool nahay.
Both will go.	Labaduba way tagi doonaan.
You for that.	Adiga taas.
I do not know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
As you should.	Sida oo kale waa inaad.
He came to me.	Wuu ii yimid.
You will need that now.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa taas hadda.
Here it is the same.	Halkan waa isku mid.
I tried to help	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo
I hope this is good.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay wanaagsan tahay.
This was a lot.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan.
That can be very interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I love it, it is	waan jeclahay, waa
She had to be there.	Waxay ahayd inay halkaas joogto.
A few of them, really.	In yar oo ka mid ah, dhab ahaantii.
He started immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u bilaabay.
I hope you can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ku caawin karto.
A little bigger.	Wax yar oo weyn.
He really wanted to.	Aad buu u rabay.
That's right now.	Waa sidaas hadda.
Sure, there is something.	Hubaal, inay jiraan wax.
It is great now.	Hadda waa weyn yahay.
I have nothing else to do, really.	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan sameeyo, runtii.
And nothing else.	Oo wax kale ma leh.
The exact extent is uncertain.	Sida ugu dhow lama hubo.
She did that very well.	Waxay samaysay taas si aad u wanaagsan.
They will find you.	Way ku heli doonaan.
I know the people who own it.	Waan ogahay dadka leh.
Everyone is very close here.	Qof walba halkan aad buu ugu dhow yahay.
It's really bad.	Runtii wuu xun yahay.
But it was so.	Laakiin aad buu sidaas u ahaa.
I want to see him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko isaga.
Everyone says so.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay sidaas.
It certainly is.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu yahay.
It can happen here.	Waxay ka dhici kartaa halkan.
He is a very good person.	Waa qof aad u fiican.
You can do it all at once.	Waxaad samayn kartaa dhammaan isku mar.
Give what you want.	Sii waxa aad rabto.
There is nothing too exciting.	Ma jiraan wax aad u xiiso badan.
he would like that.	wuu jeclaan lahaa sidaas.
I really think this is going to be great.	Runtii waxaan filayaa in tani ay noqon doonto mid weyn.
It was familiar to me.	Waxay ii ahayd wax la yaqaan.
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
That is why he is here.	Taasi waa sababta uu halkan u joogo.
I could not get close	Waan u dhawaan waayay
It was very small.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u yar.
He is indeed a great man.	Runtii waa nin weyn.
Not one person.	Hal qof ma aha.
It will take some time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa muddo.
It was the same everywhere.	Waxay ahayd isku mid meel walba.
Lots of them.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah.
I really want to know.	Waxaan rabaa inaan si dhab ah u ogaado.
Everyone knows who you are.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa qofka aad tahay.
It is probably a very small thing.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay wax aad u yar.
Now I can see him.	Hadda waan arki karaa isaga.
I think the latter.	Waxa ay ila tahay tan dambe.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
And he saw that it was good.	Oo wuxuu arkay inuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
He is a much older person.	Waa qof aad uga weyn.
He did not do it again.	Mar dambe ma uu samayn.
But you seem to know that.	Laakiin waxay u egtahay inaad taas ogtahay.
You can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban kartid.
After a while he left.	Wax yar ka dib wuu baxay.
And not done.	Oo aan la samayn.
A tall man entered the room.	Nin dheer ayaa qolka soo galay.
I can say that.	Taas waan sheegi karaa.
You do not have to.	Ma aha in aad u baahan tahay.
he set.	wuu dhigay.
I know you can	Waan ogahay waxaad awoodo
He was in a bad mood.	Niyad xun buu ku jiray.
I am not one of them.	Anigu ka mid ma ihi.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
She told him they were close.	Waxay u sheegtay inay u dhow yihiin.
Right, you said.	Sax, waxaad tidhi.
He certainly did not know me.	Waxa hubaal ah in aanu i garanayn.
He did it for me.	Wuu ii sameeyay.
Not the crowd, me.	Ma aha dadka badan ee, aniga.
I am still in it.	Wali waan ku jiraa.
But there was more to come.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax kale oo soo socda.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan in la sameeyo.
Very good, bad intellect.	Aad u fiican, caqli xun.
This is really a real place.	Runtii tani waa meel dhab ah.
It’s ‘me’ making	Waa 'aniga' samaynta
He knows that.	Taas wuu garanayaa.
That's why he came back.	Waa sababta uu u soo noqday.
No one else did.	Qof kale ma samayn.
I really am not.	Runtii ma ihi.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
You can no longer find a job.	Mar dambe shaqo ma heli kartid.
Otherwise, you may not get much.	Haddii kale, waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan heli karin wax badan.
It is a great opportunity for you.	Waxay kuu tahay fursad weyn.
But this is so beautiful.	Laakiin tani aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Not sure how long this will be.	Ma hubo ilaa inta ay tani ahaan doonto.
One meal, please	Hal cunto, fadlan
I am not wanted here	La igama doonayo halkan
No one was here.	Qofna halkan ma joogin.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
Still, she didn't give up.	Weli, ma aysan siin.
I told him.	Waa u sheegay.
I started to wonder.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay.
I am one of them.	Anigu waxaan ka mid ahay.
I can tell you very well.	Si fiican ayaan kuu sheegi karaa.
Lots of good stuff.	Wax badan oo wanaagsan.
But it has to be done !.	Laakiin waa in la sameeyaa!.
That is too long.	Taasi aad bay u dheer tahay.
Everything would help.	Wax kasta ayaa ku caawin lahaa.
I didn't even understand that.	Taas xitaa in yar ma fahmin.
You are very happy.	Aad baad u faraxsan tahay.
Here, everything is recent.	Halkan, wax walba waa dhawaan.
I am not new friends here.	Halkan uma ihi saaxiibo cusub.
In fact, nothing more.	Dhab ahaantii, wax aan ahayn.
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
He then disappeared.	Ka dib waa la waayay.
At first, he could see nothing.	Markii hore, waxba ma uu arki karin.
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
This was amazing.	Tani waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
It will help you.	Way ku caawin doontaa.
I love you	waan ku jeclahay
That's right.	Waa wax sax ah.
He wants to buy it.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ka iibsado.
But they are too many.	Laakiin aad bay u badan yihiin.
It is the best for everyone.	Waa kan ugu fiican qof kasta.
I felt for sure.	Waxaan dareemay hubaal.
He felt better.	Waxa uu dareemay fiicnaan.
So do all people.	Sidaas oo kale dadka oo dhan.
I am still there	wali waan joogaa
No one knows where he is.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu joogo.
Going to work	Shaqo aaday
And everyone else.	Iyo dadka kale oo dhan.
I will come back to pick you up	Waan soo noqon doonaa si aan ku soo qaado
I asked her what she would do.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa ay samayn doonto.
What is to be done.	Waa maxay waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo.
Is it needed?	Ma loo baahan yahay?
It would be the right thing to do.	Waxay ahaan lahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
Not much of an opportunity for that.	Ma aha wax badan oo fursad ah taas.
It didn't take long to find it.	Waqti badan kuma qaadan in la helo.
All is still, now.	Dhammaan waa weli, hadda.
See you tomorrow.	Berri ayaan arki doonaa.
That will be a clear day.	Taasi waxay ahaan doontaa maalin cad.
But it looks good.	Laakiin waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
Tell him what he needs to do.	U sheeg waxa uu u baahan yahay inuu sameeyo.
They may not even have it tomorrow.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa berri haysan.
Obviously he didn’t really take me seriously.	Waxa iska cad in aanu si dhab ah ii qaadan.
Maybe it would be better if they did.	Malaha way fiicnaan lahayd haddii ay sameeyaan.
I love everything you do.	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo aad sameyso.
He needs me.	Wuu ii baahan yahay.
Soon, she will be back home.	Dhawaan, waxay ku noqon doontaa guriga.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
She will get the job.	Waxay heli doontaa shaqada.
That was mostly interesting.	Taasi waxay inta badan ahayd mid xiiso leh.
But they may not even want to do that.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa rabin inay taas sameeyaan.
You will be great.	Waxaad noqon doontaa mid weyn.
He said he has.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu leeyahay.
I will give him something to take home.	Waxaan siin doonaa wax uu guriga ugu qaado.
Very, very good.	Aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
You will come to the front door.	Waxaad iman doontaa albaabka guriga.
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
I don't talk much.	Inta badan ma hadlo.
That is why they will not do it.	Taasi waa sababta aysan u yeeli doonin.
But you would love to.	Laakiin waad jeclaan lahayd.
He was very tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u adag.
I would like to do the same.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan u sameeyo si la mid ah.
Maybe that's it.	Malaha taasi waa.
Please tell me this is not the case	Fadlan ii sheeg tani maaha
I never knew that, until recently.	Weligay taas maan ogayn, ilaa dhawaan.
Before you go.	Inta aadan tagin .
I knew nothing.	Waxba maan garanayn.
The same with us.	Nala mid ah.
I didn't think so.	Uma malaynayn.
It really is.	Waa runtii.
He had.	Wuu lahaa.
I got one	Mid baan ku helay
I want it here.	halkaan ayaan ka rabaa.
I am happy for him.	Waan ku faraxsanahay isaga.
That doesn't sound good.	Taasi uma eka mid wanaagsan.
I have to go	waa inaan tago
He does not want to come.	Ma rabo inuu yimaado.
But it can be real.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa mid dhab ah.
Obviously there was a lot I could see.	Sida cad waxaa jiray wax badan oo aan arki karo.
You know, something very beautiful.	Waad ogtahay, wax aad u qurux badan.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
It may still be.	Wali waa laga yaabaa.
Here, there was none.	Halkan, ma jirin.
It was everything.	Waxay ahayd wax walba.
I promised.	Waan ballan qaaday .
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
This cannot be stopped now.	Tan hadda lama joojin karo.
That’s how things are.	Taasi waa sida ay wax yihiin.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
That was interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
And much more if we can get it.	Iyo wax badan oo ka mid ah haddii aan heli karno.
After a while he could not.	Wax yar ka dib wuu awoodi waayay.
I don't want to leave the house.	Ma rabo in aan guriga wax ka soo baxo.
I really got it	Runtii waan helay
But there are.	Laakiin way jiraan.
No one has been seen yet.	Wali lama arag hal qof.
Tell them what happened.	U sheeg waxa dhacay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
There is really nothing to do.	Runtii ma jiraan wax la sameeyo.
Today, there is a lot of money.	Maanta, waxaa jira lacag badan.
But they are as good as ever.	Laakiin way u fiican yihiin sida hadda oo kale.
I dont understand.	Maan fahmin.
I want to be here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan joogo
It's great.	Waa wax aad u fiican.
Not at all.	Maaha.
It was not the right thing to do.	Ma ahayn wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
What else can she do.	Maxaa kale oo ay sameyn kartaa.
It should not have been so.	Ma ahayn in sidaas la sameeyo.
I think it can happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici karto.
Everyone is good enough.	Qof walba waa ku filan yahay.
I am not the reason.	Aniga ma aha sababta.
Can someone please do that.	Qof fadlan ma samayn karaa taas.
What he could not say.	Wixii uu ku odhan waayay.
That, even more so.	Taas, xitaa ka sii badan.
They do.	Waxay sidaas sameeyaan.
There are good things here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo wanaagsan halkan.
He said.	Wuxuu yidhi .
But he is not ready for work.	Laakiin diyaar uma aha shaqada.
This is enough.	Tani waa ku filan tahay.
It will be needed.	Waa loo baahan doonaa.
I want him to get out of here.	Waxaan rabaa inuu halkaan ka baxo.
This can be time consuming.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa waqti.
It was more than enough.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan ku filan.
But others will not.	Laakiin dadka kale ma yeeli doonaan.
You are smart.	Waad caqli badan tahay.
You can't see him.	Ma arki kartid isaga.
It would soon be over.	Mar dhow way dhammaan lahayd.
Everything is the same.	Wax walba waa sidii hore.
It felt like he was now someone else.	Waxa la dareemay in uu hadda yahay qof kale.
I hope someone tells me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof ii sheego.
But here there is a bigger problem.	Laakiin halkan waxaa ka jira dhibaato ka weyn.
Maybe he did.	Malaha wuu sameeyay.
He did not know what it was.	Ma uu garanayn waxa uu yahay.
I'll talk about it tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
He will give you everything he has.	Wuxuu ku siin doonaa wax kasta oo uu haysto.
I wish him long work.	Waxaan u rajeynayaa shaqo dheer.
I tried	waan isku dayay
I saw it very well.	Aad baan u arkay.
Now I will give one.	Hadda waxaan siin doonaa hal.
But I did not get it.	Laakiin maan helin.
Not that he wants to but still.	Ma aha in uu doono laakiin weli.
I went to work	Waxaan u baxay shaqada
Maybe he was.	Malaha wuu ahaa.
I think otherwise.	Waxaan qabaa si kale.
Nothing can be expected.	Wax la filan karo ma jiraan.
He was to come tomorrow.	Waxay ahayd inuu berri yimaado.
I know you are there	Waan ogahay inaad halkaas joogto
That’s why we do what we do.	Waa sababta aan u samayno waxaan samayno.
I had to come back here.	Waxay ahayd inaan anigu halkan ku soo noqdo.
Just what he needs.	Kaliya waxa uu u baahan yahay.
What did he say.	Muxuu yidhi.
I never said.	Weligay ma odhan.
I am one of them.	Aniga ayaa ka mid ah.
Something she said was very difficult.	Wax ay sheegtay ayaa ahaa mid aad u adag.
I told him.	Waxaan u sheegay.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Very, very good !.	Aad iyo aad u fiican!.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
It seems to be non-existent.	Waxay u egtahay inaysan jirin.
We are of the same opinion.	Waxaan nahay isku fikrad.
But he couldn't, yet.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay, weli.
It probably exists, too.	Waxay u badan tahay inay jirto, sidoo kale.
Maybe they do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sameeyaan.
Another day was made.	Maalin kale ayaa la sameeyay.
He never wanted to.	Waligiis ma rabin.
If nothing else, that's it.	Haddii aysan wax kale ahayn, waa taas.
That is a lot.	Taasi waa wax badan.
I will tell you not to be here.	Waxaan u sheegi doonaa inaadan halkan joogin.
That is a good day.	Taasi waa maalin wanaagsan.
He refused to talk to me.	Wuu diiday inuu ila hadlo.
I hope that is correct.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi sax tahay.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
All is well	Dhammaan waxa fiican
This is what I was told.	Waa tan la ii sheegay.
I was surprised.	Waxaan la yaabay.
I have no one.	Qofna ma haysto.
Very interesting.	Aad u xiiso badan.
Here it is!	Halkan waa!
Really, it’s a must.	Runtii, waa wax loo baahan yahay.
But I did not understand.	Laakiin ma fahmin.
It didn't turn out well.	Si fiican uma soo bixin.
I'm afraid this is it.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay tani tahay.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
If there is a problem.	Waa haddii ay dhibaato jirto.
Maybe, a little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, in yar.
It is usually done.	Inta badan waa la sameeyaa.
He tried to help.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu caawiyo.
I didn't say much.	Wax badan uma sheegin.
I gave everything.	Wax walba waan siiyay.
We must too.	Waa in aan sidoo kale.
A lot is going on and you do not understand.	Wax badan ayaa socda oo aadan fahmin.
He could not help himself.	Waa uu is caawin waayay.
Very, very, very much.	Aad iyo aad iyo aad u badan.
I would help you with this.	Tani waan kaa caawin lahaa.
It should have less time.	Waa in ay waqti yar leedahay.
He was clearly surprised by what had happened.	Si cad ayuu ula yaabay waxa dhacay.
That is what happened here.	Taasi waa waxa halkan ka dhacay.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ma rabin inaan cidna arko.
It has been going on for a very long time.	Waxay samaysay muddo aad u dheer.
Let me talk to him.	Aan la hadlo isaga.
I would like to know why.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sababta.
Will do it again.	Mar kale samayn doona.
I had a long day.	Waxaan lahaa maalin dheer.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
That was what he would do.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu samayn lahaa.
Surprising.	Yaab badan.
There is no one like him.	Qof la mid ah ma jiro.
I didn't have that	maan haysan taas
And they will do beautifully whatever you want.	Oo waxay si qurux badan u samayn doonaan wax kasta oo aad rabto.
He asked them not to leave.	Waxa uu ka codsaday in aanay bixin.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I can get it.	Waan heli karaa.
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid iska cad.
What a happy man.	Waa maxay nin faraxsan.
I do not have to do this.	Ma aha inaan tan sameeyo.
That is the only thing we can do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno.
He was a very tall man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u dheer.
He could not do anything wrong.	Wax xun ma uu samayn karin.
there we will see you	halkaas ayaan kugu arki doonaa
He looked surprised to see me.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid la yaabay inuu i arko.
It's hard work.	Waa shaqo adag.
Just don’t do it.	Kaliya ha samayn.
It would be something else.	Waxay noqon lahayd wax kale.
I like it	waan ka helay
Too much.	Si aad u badan.
Don't do that, he said firmly.	Taas ha samayn, ayuu si adag u yidhi.
You will need to do this on your own.	Tan waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad keligaa sameyso.
It is so today.	Waa sidaas maanta.
He should tell them what he saw.	Waa in uu u sheego waxa uu arkay.
No luck.	Nasiib ma leh.
You can not, they do not exist.	Ma kartid, ma jiraan.
They did not find him.	Ma ay helin isaga.
I do not like	Ma jecli
The bigger the better.	Ka weyn ayaa ka fiican.
I want a man.	Waxaan rabaa nin.
I can't afford a job.	Ma awoodo inaan shaqo helo.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii waan ka helay.
I found	waan helay
He would do a lot today.	Wax badan ayuu samayn lahaa maanta.
Now if you do nothing about it.	Hadda haddii aadan waxba ka qaban.
He certainly knew that was not true.	Hubaal wuu ogaa in taasi run ahayn.
Everyone seems to have someone.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu qof haysto.
That's right.	Waa sax.
Maybe again.	Mar kale ayaa laga yaabaa.
That is why he does this.	Waa sababta uu tan u sameeyo.
That is what you need.	Taasi waa waxa aad u baahan tahay.
I want to know what happened there.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa halkaas ka dhacay.
You can do this.	Tani waad sameyn kartaa.
He looked good tonight.	Caawa si fiican buu u eegay.
But I have to go now.	Laakiin waa inaan hadda tagin.
I have no idea what is going on.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa socda.
Apparently it was too long.	Sida cad waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer.
There is nothing and everything at once.	Ma jiraan wax iyo wax walba hal mar.
One is obviously a very bad job.	Mid ka mid ah sida iska cad waa shaqo aad u xun.
He seemed reluctant to speak.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aan rabin in uu hadlo.
That will not help him.	Taasi ma caawin doonto isaga.
I'm sorry I can't help it anymore.	Waan ka xumahay mar dambe ma caawin karo.
This really can't happen.	Tani run ahaantii ma dhici karto.
But he knew she did.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inay samaysay.
But he had many friends.	Laakiin wuxuu lahaa saaxiibo badan.
Really, it's a bad thing.	Run ahaantii, waa wax xun.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ma rabo inuu hadlo.
And we need everything we can get.	Oo waxaan u baahanahay wax kasta oo aan heli karno.
I wonder who.	Waxaan la yaabay waa kuma.
I want to know what happened next.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wixii dhacay ka dib.
He only says it to me.	Aniga kaliya ayuu leeyahay.
Very, very.	Aad iyo aad.
Do not stop now.	Ha joojin hadda.
I just did not know what to do with it.	Kaliya maan garanayn waxaan ka sameeyo.
Tom said a little, for a while.	Tom wax yar ayuu yidhi, muddo.
Surprise often.	Yaab inta badan.
He said we will see.	Wuxuu yidhi waan arki doonaa.
But she could not say that now.	Laakiin taas hadda ma ay odhan karin.
The worst.	Waxa ugu xun.
Something is wrong	Wax aan sax ahayn
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
I'm sorry but someone has to tell you.	Waan ka xumahay laakiin waa in qof kuu sheego.
There were three people in the room.	Qolka waxaa joogay saddex qof.
You can't talk to him.	Ma la hadli kartid isaga.
That is what we need.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
Fast, and much.	Si degdeg ah, iyo wax badan.
Like, so be it.	Sida, waa sidaas.
There is so much here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo halkan ah.
Now more than ever.	Hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
Ah, very good.	Ah, aad u fiican.
Give me a chance.	Fursad i sii.
But now it is done.	Laakiin hadda waa la sameeyay.
Probably better for me.	Malaha aniga si ii wanaagsan.
But really, there is no real truth to that.	Laakiin run ahaantii, ma jiraan wax run ah oo run ah taas.
Things will happen there	Waxyaabo ka dhici doona halkaas
He was already at home.	Hore ayuu guriga ugu jiray.
We can not leave.	Ma bixi karno.
I know her well.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
I would be ready to help.	Waxaan diyaar u noqon lahaa inaan caawiyo.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
It can make things worse, and worse.	Waxay samayn kartaa waxyaabo sida xun, oo aad uga xun.
But not much is expected of me.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax badan oo la iga filan doono.
I know it's not me.	Waan ogahay in aanay aniga ahayn.
He did what he did.	Wuu sameeyay wixii uu sameeyay.
But that's all you need.	Laakiin taas waxa ugu badan ee aad u baahan tahay.
And, for a while, that's enough.	Oo, in muddo ah, waa ku filan tahay.
It should not be so.	Waa in aanay sidaas noqon.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
There was really nothing to see.	Runtii ma jirin wax la arko.
Just tell me what to do.	Kaliya ii sheeg waxa aan sameeyo.
Everything you want will be done.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto waa la samayn doonaa.
Not much, he thought.	Ma badna, ayuu is yidhi.
I do not understand what he wants.	Ma fahmin waxa uu rabo.
Do not talk to me.	Ha ila hadlin.
I'm sorry you can't see.	Waan ka xumahay ma arki kartid.
I did not know much, but I knew it was not something like that.	Wax badan kama ogayn, laakiin waan ogaa inaysan ahayn wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I would go see people.	Waxaan aadi lahaa inaan dadka soo arko.
Obviously, there is a big one but.	Sida cad, waxaa jira mid weyn laakiin.
I got a better idea.	Waxaan helay fikrad ka fiican.
I would be right	sax baan ahaan lahaa
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
What would you like to do?	Maxaad jeclaan lahayd inaad sameyso?
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
A lot will come out, but this is good.	Wax badan ayaa soo bixi doona, laakiin tani waa fiican tahay.
One great job.	Hal shaqo oo weyn.
Much better than before.	Wax badan ka wanaagsan sidii hore.
I was nothing and I had nothing.	waxba maan ahayn oo waxba maan haysan.
I should have seen you.	Waxay ahayd inaan ku arko.
The rest is here.	Inta kale waa halkaan.
It will not do that.	Taas ma yeeli doono.
He did not like it.	Ma uu jeclayn.
Sida.	Sida.
What do you think about this?	Maxay kula tahay arrintan?.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Kaliya faraxsan, faraxsan, faraxsan.
Like you	Adiga oo kale
But it had to be done.	Laakiin waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I am happy to know.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ogaado.
I do not know what happened to you.	ma garanayo waxa kugu dhacay.
Not like here	Ma aha sida halkan
You are lucky.	Nasiib baad tahay.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyo.
tell me why you want it.	ii sheeg sababta aad u rabto.
I can't help but be beautiful.	Si qurux badan ma caawin karo.
You know, which is nothing.	Waad ogtahay, taas oo aan waxba ahayn.
I knew I would be together again.	Waan ogaa inaan mar kale wada joogi doono.
Where she would probably stay.	Meesha ay u badan tahay inay joogi lahayd.
I have done this so far.	Tan waan sameeyay ilaa hadda.
I want to be myself.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo aniga.
I just happened to be where it was made.	Kaliya waxaan ka dhacay meesha laga sameeyay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
He must first get to know him well.	Waa inuu marka hore si fiican u barto isaga.
This is what you can expect.	Tani waa waxa aad filan karto.
I don’t even see people, really.	Anigu xitaa ma arko dadka, run ahaantii.
He said she would love it more.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay sidaas ka sii jeclaan doonto.
Tell me everything you told me.	U sheeg wax kasta oo aad ii sheegtay.
How to do it.	Sida aad u sameyso.
I am a smart person.	Waxaan ahay qof caqli badan.
As there is something here.	Sida halkan wax ka jiraan.
That is what he did.	Taas oo ah waxa uu sameeyay.
This is him.	Tani waa isaga.
Why not now?	Maxaa diiday hadda?.
This is very good.	Tani aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
This was a beautiful day.	Tani waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
I found out who she was.	Waxaan helay qofka ay ahayd.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
I wanted that.	Taas ayaan rabay.
I do not know where he is.	Ma garanayo meel uu joogo.
This is first for you.	Tani marka hore adiga.
You do not have to do this alone.	Ma aha inaad tan keligaa samayso.
Always.	Had iyo jeer.
Maybe I still do.	Malaha wali waan sameeyaa.
Probably three.	Waxay u badan tahay saddex.
It will happen.	Way ku dhici doontaa.
But it will happen.	Laakiin way dhici doontaa.
I thought so.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay sidaas tahay.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I need to do this	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan sameeyo
It's just me.	Waa aniga kaliya.
Maybe that's right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax tahay.
I really happened.	Run ahaantii waan dhacay.
He is obviously not a man.	Waxa iska cad in aanu nin ahayn.
He was right.	Run buu sheegay.
I do not know how to help you.	Ma garanayo si aan kuu caawiyo.
You can see why.	Waad arki kartaa sababta.
To know you are here.	Si aad u ogaato inaad halkan joogto.
I don’t want to do it here.	Ma doonayo inaan halkan ku sameeyo.
You did everything.	Waxaad samaysay wax kasta.
I need to do something.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax sameeyo.
Not once.	Hal mar ma aha.
I didn't think it was real.	Uma malaynayn inay dhab tahay.
Anyway do this ?.	Si kasta oo tan loo sameeyo?.
Simply put now.	Si dhib yar hadda.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
That will be seen.	Taasi waa la arki doonaa.
There was nothing to do.	Wax la sameeyo ma jirin.
This is where they live.	Tani meesha ay ku nool yihiin.
You.	Adiga.
He is still a man.	Weli waa nin.
The smartest people had.	Dadka ugu caqli badan ayaa lahaa.
He is fine	Wuu fiican yahay
They are what they are.	Waxay yihiin waxay yihiin.
I want to know.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado.
Now I am at home	Hadda waxaan joogaa guriga
This is what will happen.	Tani waa waxa dhici doona.
But it really is not.	Laakiin run ahaantii maaha.
It is not money.	Ma ahan lacag.
But it is the right thing to do.	Laakiin waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
But he knew he would not do it.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inuusan yeeli doonin.
You may not like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan jeclayn.
I’ve been in it for a while.	Runtii waan ku jiray in muddo ah.
It will not happen tomorrow, but it will come.	Berri ma dhici doonto, laakiin way iman doontaa.
He told us everything.	Wax walba wuu noo sheegay.
I, for one, am the latter.	Aniga, mid, ayaa ah kan dambe.
All in all, but one is.	Dhammaan, laakiin mid ka mid ah waa.
I had a husband and he was a good man.	Nin baan lahaa oo nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
I want to learn	Waxaan rabaa inaan barto
I have heard a lot about you.	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay.
Do you really need it? 	Runtii ma u baahan tahay?
She did, really.	Way samaysay, runtii.
You can be sure of that.	Taas waxaad hubaal ka noqon kartaa.
Anything you can afford	Wax kasta oo aad bixin karto
You will leave.	Waad bixi doontaa.
This was very fast.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u degdeg badan.
That is what they are.	Taasi waa waxa ay yihiin.
That we can be friends.	In aan saaxiibo noqon karno.
Love, love, love.	Jecel, jecel, jecel.
And often it is.	Oo inta badan waa.
He should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inuu si fiican u ogaado.
Maybe it's something else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay wax kale.
We have so much.	Wax badan ayaa naga jira.
One refused.	Mid way diiday.
I can guess.	Waxaan u malayn karaa.
I am surprised.	Waa ila yaab.
She has not yet said.	Wali uma ay sheegin.
I don't see why.	Ma arko sababta.
That is a long time ago.	Taasi waa muddo hore.
It looks interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid xiiso leh.
He was a loving man.	Nin jecel buu ahaa.
But I'm not even sure about that.	Laakiin taas xitaa ma hubo.
Maybe not.	Ma laga yaabaa.
She can say it can be good.	Waxay odhan kartaa way fiicnaan kartaa.
But you can help me if you can tell me more.	Laakiin waad i caawin kartaa haddii aad wax badan ii sheegi karto.
Very small, very new.	Aad u yar, aad u cusub.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
They probably have nothing to do with him.	Waxay u badan tahay in aanay waxba isaga la samayn.
It is not a lie.	Been ma aha.
He was exactly who he wanted to be.	Wuxuu ahaa dhab ahaan kii uu rabay inuu noqdo.
But there are many other things that can be done.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo badan oo la samayn karo.
He is there.	Halkaas ayuu joogaa.
Until he told her.	Ilaa uu u sheegay.
Maybe it's best to break up.	Malaha waxaa ugu wanaagsan in la kala tago.
I'm glad you're better.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad ka fiican tahay.
They are no longer there.	Wax badan kuma sii jiraan.
This was something new for me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd wax igu cusub.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
I may not understand.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan fahmin.
I do not know what he wants to do.	Waxa uu rabo inuu sameeyo ma garanayo.
If you could help me that would be great.	Haddii aad i caawin karto taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
He has done a lot for me.	Wax badan ayuu igu sameeyay.
But not too much.	Laakiin aad uma badna.
Still too much.	Weli aad u badan.
I am as busy as ever.	Mashquul ayaan ahay sidii hore.
He was a great man.	Nin weyn buu ahaa.
Very good.	Mid aad u wanaagsan.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
I want it	waan rabaa
Now he wonders why he thinks he can.	Hadda waxa uu la yaabay sababta uu u malaynayo inuu awoodo.
You never know what we really are.	Ma aadan garanayn waxa aanu nahay runtii.
I want to learn more.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan ka barto.
Probably more than anyone else.	Malaha in ka badan qof kasta oo kale.
And you weren’t.	Oo ma aadan ahayn.
Maybe, a little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, wax yar.
More than once	In ka badan hal mar
A little too close.	Xoogaa aad u dhow.
I had to do more.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan sameeyo.
She did.	Way samaysay.
I'm sorry, you have to do this but.	Waan ka xumahay, inaad tan sameyso laakiin.
It will not take long.	Ma qaadan doonto waqti dheer.
There was a man who came out.	Waxaa jiray nin soo baxay.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	Hadda waxa uu rabo wuu samayn karaa.
He knew what was to come.	Wuu ogaa waxa iman doona.
I am very happy here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay halkan
I say she has.	Waxaan leeyahay way leedahay.
She was the only person available.	Waxay ahayd qofka kaliya ee la heli karo.
It's a bit.	Waa xoogaa.
As they are.	Sida ay yihiin.
Really, really good.	Runtii, runtii si fiican.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
He told me not to do anything.	Waxba ha samayn buu igu yidhi.
I hope they happen.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici doonaan.
No one could have guessed.	Qofna ma malayn karin.
It will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doonto.
I really could not.	Run ahaantii waan awoodi waayay.
I was first.	Waxaan ahaa markii hore.
I do not know how this can happen.	Ma garanayo sida ay taasi u dhici karto.
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
He did not get a new job.	Ma uusan helin shaqo cusub.
It will be over now.	Hadda way dhammaan doontaa.
He returned quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u soo noqday.
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
This is how it looks.	Tani waa sida ay u egtahay.
It will not stay.	Lama joogi doono.
He must have heard something.	Waa in uu wax maqlay.
It still exists.	Wali waa jiraa.
I don't like you, really.	Aan ku jeclayn, runtii.
I really don't think they will.	Runtii uma maleynayo inay sameyn doonaan.
There is no money to make it now.	Wax lacag ah oo lagu sameeyo ma jirto hadda.
But they are enough.	Laakiin way ku filan yihiin.
I have not seen him.	ma arag isaga.
I wish I could be better	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa si ka wanaagsan
This can be anything you want.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Can anyone help me with this.	Qof ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
I know, it's a terrible problem.	Waan ogahay, inay tahay dhibaato aad u xun.
He has been here a lot.	Wax badan ayuu halkan joogay.
Maybe even bigger.	Waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa ka weyn.
They will be coming soon.	Waxay dhawaan iman doonaan dhawaan.
She loves me.	Way i jeceshahay.
But today, this is the worst.	Laakiin maanta, tani waa tan ugu xun.
Maybe one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in maalin.
Who is it.	Waa kuma.
We will talk.	Waan wada hadli doonaa.
If you are happy with where you are, it is for you.	Haddii aad ku faraxsan tahay meesha aad joogto, adiga ayaa kuu fiican.
You know, when.	Waad ogtahay, marka ay.
He looked back.	Dib buu eegay.
Nothing, either.	Ma jiraan wax, sidoo kale.
What did she do to you.	Maxay ku samaysay.
Everyone said it was.	Qof kastaa wuxuu sheegay inay ahayd.
Why not do that now.	Maxaad hadda u samayn weyday taas.
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
I spent a lot of time with him.	Waxaan la qaatay waqti aad u badan.
He thought it was too hard.	Wuxuu mooday inuu aad u adag yahay.
Now he could not stop.	Hadda wuu joojin waayay.
But it is, and very good.	Laakiin waa, oo aad u fiican.
You can be right.	Waxaad noqon kartaa sax.
You are very good.	Aad baad u fiican tahay.
Too much work.	Shaqo aad u badan.
It is a small place.	Waa meel yar.
Tell us where you are.	Meesha aad joogto noo sheeg.
I have to leave	Waa inaan baxo
I got a good idea.	Waxaan helay fikrad fiican.
He took three.	Saddex ayuu qaatay.
That was certainly true for me.	Hubaal in taasi run bay iga ahayd.
how is your new job ?.	sidee tahay shaqada cusub?.
It seems to be a problem.	Waxay u egtahay inay dhibaato tahay.
It is again.	Waa mar kale.
And nothing else.	Oo wax kale ma jiraan.
For the most part, that was true.	Inta badan, taasi run bay ahayd.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
He is really good.	Runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
It's up to you.	Waa kuu.
He was a very good man.	Nin aad u wanaagsan buu ahaa.
Nothing will happen to me.	Waxba igu dhici maayo.
I probably.	Waxaan u badan tahay.
Let me tell you something.	Aan wax kuu sheego.
He is still not able to work clearly.	Weli ma awoodo inuu si cad u shaqeeyo.
Each one.	Mid walba.
But it was not him.	Laakiin ma ahayn isaga.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
I can spend a lot of money on this.	Waxaan ku bixin karaa lacag badan tan.
What to do.	Maxaa la sameeyaa.
I know you can do it.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyn karto.
I will do it	waan qaban doonaa
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad.
First you.	Marka hore adiga.
I'm afraid of nothing.	Waxaan ka baqayaa waxba.
I do bad things.	Waxaan sameeyaa wax xun.
It was amazing to see.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh in la arko.
She did not return.	Ma ay soo noqon.
It looks awful, right now.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid aad u xun, hadda.
I doubt you.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inaad.
I would like to know why.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sababta.
He looked bad.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid xun.
That is what has been said, but it is probably a lie.	Taasi waa waxa la yidhi, laakiin malaha waa been.
He seemed to really want someone to talk to.	Waxa uu u muuqday in uu si dhab ah u rabo qof uu la hadlo.
Do not believe it.	Ha rumaysan.
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
You might even like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad xitaa jeceshahay.
It was	Waxay ahayd
It was unnecessary.	Waxay ahayd mid aan loo baahnayn.
Not very good.	Ma ahan mid aad u wanaagsan.
Let me work.	Aan shaqeeyo.
Meel.	Meel.
I can no longer love it.	Mar dambe ma jeclaan karo.
I found it to be very beautiful.	Waxaan u arkay inuu aad u qurux badan yahay.
This has.	Tani waxay leedahay.
I don't know if she has it or not.	Ma garanayo inay leedahay iyo in kale.
Everyone fell for it.	Qof kastaa wuu ku dhacay.
I'm really sure.	Runtii waan hubaa.
And they didn’t have much of that.	Oo ma ay haysan wax badan oo taas ka mid ah.
This he did but he did.	Tani aad laakiin wuu sameeyay.
She told me what she told you.	Waxay ii sheegtay waxay kuu sheegtay.
I would like that too.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa sidaas oo kale.
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
Maybe she should do something like that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sameyso wax sidaas oo kale ah.
It looks like a problem.	Waxay u egtahay dhibaato.
But how? 	Laakiin sidee?
I have not seen anyone.	Cidna maan arag.
But he does.	Laakiin wuu sameeyaa.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
He really did not know.	Runtii ma uu ogayn.
That is true, so far.	Taasi waa run, ilaa hadda.
But it will not happen.	Laakiin ma dhici doonto.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
You can leave at any time	Waad iska bixi kartaa wakhti kasta
I do not have	ma hayo
She said.	Waxay tidhi.
I do not know how bad it is.	Ma garanayo sida ay u xun tahay.
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
It can certainly happen.	Dhab ahaantii way dhici kartaa.
It's new.	Waa cusub ayaa soo baxay.
I do not do such a thing.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma sameeyo.
But not too much.	Laakiin aad uma badna.
He is here now.	Hadda wuu joogaa.
That was more than luck.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax ka badan nasiib.
He has not done it yet.	Weli ma uu samayn.
It can be very difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
It was close.	Waxay ahayd mid isku dhow.
I'm sure you will find it at home.	Waan hubaa inaad ka heli doonto guriga.
Maybe she still does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli sameyso.
You will go home soon	Waxaad aadi doontaa guriga dhawaan
Every day it was very clear what that would be.	Maalin kasta waxay ahayd mid aad u cad waxa ay taasi noqon doonto.
She told a friend.	Waxay u sheegtay saaxiib.
What he did was not interesting.	Waxa uu sameeyay ma ahayn mid xiiso leh.
I came back to tell you that.	Waxaan u soo noqday inaan sidaas kuu sheego.
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.	Waan ka xumahay, laakiin lama caawin karo.
Nice to see you.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay inaan ku arko.
what is it you	waa maxay adiga?.
She will need that.	Way u baahan doontaa taas.
Wonder what he has now.	Yaab waxa uu hadda hayo.
Take what you need.	Qaado waxaad u baahan tahay.
We would spend very little time together.	Waxaan wada qaadan lahayn waqti aad u yar.
I reviewed a few of them.	Waxaan dib u eegay dhowr ka mid ah.
Really good.	Runtii wanaagsan.
I can see what you really are.	Waxaan ku arki karaa waxaad dhab ahaantii tahay.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I always did that.	Had iyo jeer taas ayaan samayn jiray.
I want to help, he said.	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo, ayuu yiri.
You will do it.	Waad qaban doontaa.
Good food.	Cunto fiican.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ilaa hadda qofna ma helin.
Do a better job.	Qabo shaqo ka wanaagsan.
I have a very good idea.	Waxaan hayaa fikrad aad u fiican.
Maybe he has something there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu halkaas wax ku haysto.
But not yet.	Laakiin weli lama arag.
And nothing else.	Oo wax kale ma jiraan.
She is not at home.	Ma joogto guriga.
Well done really.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay runtii.
I will be here tomorrow.	Waxaan iman doonaa halkan berrito.
She can't leave now.	Hadda ma bixi karto.
We can't give you everything you want.	Kuma siin karno wax kasta oo aad rabto.
But let me tell you something.	Laakiin aan wax kuu sheego.
It can even help	Xitaa wuu caawin karaa
I just left home.	Hadda ayaan guriga ka baxay.
It looks good for people.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid dadka u fiican.
so I liked it.	sidaas ayaan uga helay.
I have to stay	Waa inaan joogo
You didn't want to do anything with him.	Ma aadan rabin inaad wax la sameyso isaga.
More has happened.	In ka badan ayaa dhacay.
But he did not stay there long.	Laakiin halkaas kuma uu sii joogin wax badan.
He could not believe what she had done.	Wuu rumaysan waayay waxay samaysay.
There is	Waxaa jira
It never was.	Waligiis ma ahayn.
It is so much bigger.	Aad iyo aad bay uga weyn tahay.
I may be able to help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan caawiyo.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
When you need it.	Marka aad u baahan tahay.
I can tell you what to do with that.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa waxa lagu sameeyo taas.
Not much, really.	Ma badna, runtii.
But he is also a very strange man.	Laakiin sidoo kale waa nin aad u yaab badan.
Really, we would love to.	Runtii, waan jeclaan lahayn.
Still, it's a good idea.	Weli, waa fikrad wanaagsan.
Everyone has a chance.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay fursad.
I need more	wax badan ayaan u baahanahay
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
I should not be able to really say that.	Waa inaanan awoodin inaan si dhab ah u sheego taas.
He thinks you have abilities you might not have.	Wuxuu u maleynayaa inaad leedahay awoodo laga yaabo inaadan lahayn.
I would love to stay here again.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaan sii joogo mar kale.
I am happy most of the time.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inta badan.
He said he just wanted to talk.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu doonayo in uu hadlo oo kaliya.
He was a really good man.	Runtii nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Laakiin qofna uma eka inuu garanayo meesha uu joogo.
I told him there was nothing to talk about.	Waxaan u sheegay in aysan jirin wax laga hadlo.
That is amazing.	Taasi waa yaab.
I would talk	waan hadli lahaa
I wish everyone would help me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa mid kasta oo i caawin lahaa.
She saw nothing else.	Wax kale ma ay arag isaga.
Do the work.	Qabo shaqada.
I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay.
He had few friends.	Waxa uu lahaa saaxiibo yar.
I have to lie.	Waa inaan been sheego.
We can not be like this.	Ma noqon karno sida tan.
Whatever she wanted, well, she didn't get it.	Wax kasta oo ay rabto, si fiican, ma helin.
Run.	Run.
Probably the same.	Malaha waa isku mid.
I don't think this is true.	Uma malaynayo in tani run tahay.
I don't know how she did it.	Ma garanayo sida ay u samaysay.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
I think it is him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu isaga yahay.
I love him.	Isaga waan jeclahay.
There is still time to do something.	Weli waxaa jira wakhti wax lagu sameeyo.
It is better not to say anything.	Waxaa fiican inaadan waxba u sheegin.
He posted another.	Mid kale ayuu soo dhigay.
No one else in the house liked it.	Qof kale oo guriga ku jiray ma jeclayn.
A lot has happened today.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa maanta dhacay.
He knew it would happen.	Wuu ogaa inay dhici doonto.
I am very happy for him.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga.
I need to eat food.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan cuno cunto.
I'm happy to help.	Ku faraxsanahay in aan caawiyo.
But now, here, he comes out.	Laakiin hadda, halkan, wuu soo baxay.
I really have to see it.	Runtii waa inaan arko.
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxa la samayn karo.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
There is always so much.	Had iyo jeer wax badan ayaa jira.
I would love to see something else.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko wax kale.
She did.	Way samaysay.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
That would be great.	Taasi runtii way fiicnaan lahayd.
Not much.	Wax badan kuma jiraan.
I am happy now.	Hadda waan faraxsanahay.
He loves to help.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu caawiyo.
Something went wrong.	Wax ayaa meesha ka baxay.
This was the best.	Tani waxay ahayd sida ugu wanaagsan.
That may be correct.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sax.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Something, someone was there.	Wax, qof baa la joogay.
That is great.	Taasi waa mid weyn.
I got a job offer	Waxaan helay shaqo bixin
Ah! 	Ah!
I am still very much.	Aad ayaan u weli ahay.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu waxba ka ogayn.
It is more than you can say.	Way ka badan tahay inaad sheegto.
I returned home	Waxaan ku soo noqday guriga
In fact, it was not a bad idea.	Dhab ahaantii, ma ahayn fikrad xun.
I do not feel him here and even near.	Ma dareemayo isaga halkan iyo xitaa meel u dhow.
He must have.	Waa in uu leeyahay.
No one can tell me how to do it.	Qofna ma ii sheegi karaa sida loo sameeyo.
I'm afraid it could happen.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay dhici karto.
I really wanted to be a part of it.	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan wax ka mid noqdo.
Only one place.	Hal meel kaliya.
I am that.	Aniga ayaa taas ah.
I can't believe it would hurt.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu wax yeeli lahaa.
They love me and need me.	Way i jecel yihiin oo ii baahan yihiin.
You do not need to tell me.	Uma baahnid inaad ii sheegto.
I can't find it right now.	Ma heli karo hadda.
I love how it looks.	Waan jeclahay sida ay u egtahay.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubaa.
The more you can do, the better.	Inta badan oo aad samayn karto, ayaa ka sii fiican.
I really don't understand.	Runtii ma fahmin.
He did not return.	Uma uu noqon.
Tan.	Tan.
I can talk to anyone.	Qof kasta waan la hadli karaa.
Everyone wanted that.	Qof walba sidaas ayuu rabay.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
What did you say?	maxaad tidhi waa la odhan jiray.
It has to be you.	Waa in ay tahay adiga.
It will be very interesting.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
But it is not a job.	Laakiin shaqo maaha.
Glad that, too.	Ku faraxsanahay taas, sidoo kale.
Good, always.	Wanaagsan, mar kasta.
Good man later.	Nin wanaagsan mar dambe.
Not just you and me.	Aniga iyo adiga kaliya maaha.
And many other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale oo badan.
How did he decide to come out ?.	Sidee ayuu u go'aansaday inuu soo baxo?.
Don't say.	Ha odhan.
They could not do anything else.	Wax kale ma ay samayn karin.
I might even see you here.	Xitaa waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ku arko halkan.
But it was difficult.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid adag.
But this may still not be true.	Laakiin tani wali sax ma noqon karto.
And so he had.	Oo sidaas ayuu lahaa.
Enough is said.	In ku filan ayaa la yidhi.
That will be interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
A lot has been seen.	Wax badan ayaa la arkay.
That was what you did.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa aad samaysay.
I have been through this a lot.	In badan ayaan tan ku dhacay.
At first no one was there.	Markii hore qofna meesha ma joogin.
A lot of everything.	Wax badan oo dhan.
Let me come back.	Aan ku soo noqdo.
Not available	Lama heli karo
One at a time.	Hal mar mid.
It is very good for me.	Aad bay ii wanaagsan tahay.
I saw a few similarities.	Wax yar oo la mid ah ayaan arkay.
Any problem, that is.	Dhibaato kasta, taasi waa.
This can happen to anyone including you.	Tani waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta oo adiga ku jiro.
He went out.	Wuu u baxay.
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
I love it.	Jeclahay.
It was a little beautiful.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo qurux badan.
It was the best place to be.	Waxay ahayd meesha ugu fiican ee la joogo.
Nothing but friends.	Wax aan ahayn saaxiibo.
That was a little while ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax yar ka hor.
I can't figure out.	Ma awoodo inaan ogaado.
If you did, you would pay.	Haddii aad sameyso, waad bixin lahayd.
There is nothing we can do.	Wax aan qaban karno ma jiraan.
Something else to work on.	Wax kale oo lagu shaqeeyo.
It's too early.	Waa hore.
I got everything out of it.	Wax walba waan ka baxay.
He has a lot to offer.	Wax badan ayuu u hayaa.
Anyone can talk to them.	Qof kasta wuu la hadli karaa.
Something he saw, for sure.	Wax uu arkay, hubaal.
He has.	Wuu hayaa.
I can talk to him better now.	Si fiican ayaan ula hadli karaa isaga hadda.
Constantly.	Si joogto ah.
It was really felt and seen.	Runtii waa la dareemay oo la arkay.
I really enjoyed this	Tan ayaan aad uga helay
He is the one who left.	Waa kii baxay.
Both are much needed now.	Labaduba aad baa hadda loo baahan yahay.
Now he does.	Hadda wuu sameeyaa.
He loves us very much.	Aad buu noo jecel yahay.
I have never seen him like that.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale.
For many of us, the better.	In badan oo naga mid ah, ayaa ka wanaagsan.
It's really too much.	Runtii aad ayuu u badan yahay.
I know how good it is when they love you.	Waan ogahay sida ay u fiican tahay marka ay ku jecel yihiin.
Another man who told the truth.	Nin kale oo run sheegay.
I did	waan sameeyay
What she says is very interesting.	Waxa ay leedahay waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
Same as school.	Isla sida dugsiga.
I did nothing!	waxba maan samayn!
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
we can not go.	ma tagi karno.
Certainly mostly me.	Waxaa hubaal ah inta badan aniga.
who knows what.	yaa yaqaan waxa.
Give your best.	Sii sida ugu fiican.
That is probably good now.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay fiican tahay hadda.
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegin.
This can do.	Tani way sameyn kartaa.
There was so much to see!	Wax badan ayaa jiray in la arko!
But I could not do anything.	Laakiin waxba ma samayn karin.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?	Waa maalin aad u qurux badan, miyaanay ahayn?
It looks the same.	Waxay u egtahay mid isku mid ah.
There is no going back.	Meel lagu noqdo ma jirto.
But one went out.	Laakiin mid baa ka baxay.
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samayn doono.
I do not want to	ma rabo
But really, that is no easy task.	Laakiin run ahaantii, taasi dhib yar maaha shaqo.
It is him.	Waa isaga.
I thought he was back.	Waxaan mooday inuu soo noqday.
He said he was happy.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu faraxsan yahay.
He has many friends.	Wuxuu leeyahay saaxiibo badan.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
We are living people.	Waxaan nahay dadka nool.
He did not say much.	Wax badan ma uu odhan.
I thought he had.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu lahaa.
It's fine, but there are a few problems.	Way fiican tahay, laakiin waxaa jira dhowr dhibaato.
That would be a good thing to do.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax fiican in la sameeyo.
Not a little if.	Ma yara haddii.
There is not much to report.	Wax badan oo la soo sheego ma jiraan.
You should when you are young.	Waa inaad marka aad yar tahay.
Everything with you is new.	Wax kasta oo kula jira waa wax cusub.
Definitely more than this.	Waxaa hubaal ah in ka badan tan.
But she did not want to.	Laakiin ma ay rabin.
Here it is.	Waa kan taas.
It was a great place.	Waxay ahayd meel fiican.
I think it is more.	Waxaan filayaa inay ka badan tahay.
I do not understand why this.	Maan fahmin sababta tan.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u wanaagsan yahay.
He dropped out of school shortly afterwards.	Wax yar ka dib dugsiga wuu ka baxay.
All of them.	Oo dhan.
I have never been, really.	Weligay ma aanan ahayn, run ahaantii.
But not a car.	Laakiin maaha baabuur.
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
Really very similar.	Runtii aad u la mid ah.
This is where it is very interesting.	Tani waa meesha ay aad u xiiso badan tahay.
Not much bigger.	Ma aha wax ka weyn.
Less than you.	In ka yar adiga.
She loves it.	Aad bay u jeceshahay.
I want to be the best.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo kan ugu fiican.
He is indeed a good man.	Runtii waa nin wanaagsan.
Same, when.	Isku mid ah, marka.
Now it was very interesting.	Hadda wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I did he said.	Waxaan sameeyay wuxuu yidhi.
And now, he loves it.	Oo hadda, wuu jecel yahay.
Even less so.	Xitaa in ka yar.
There is only one.	Waxaa jira hal kaliya.
But this was not done.	Laakiin tan lama samayn.
I would love to see you again.	Aad baan u jeclahay inaan mar kale ku arko.
There really is no such thing as this.	Runtii ma jiraan wax kale oo tan ah.
No one found it.	Cidna ma ay helin.
He seemed to be everywhere at once.	Waxa uu u muuqday in uu meel walba hal mar joogo.
Every day is a new day.	Maalin kasta waa maalin cusub.
They will surely return.	Waxa hubaal ah inay soo noqon doonaan.
He left.	Waa uu ka baxay.
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
But I must.	Laakiin waa in aan.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
It was a little weird.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh oo yar.
Let us know if you need anything.	Noo soo sheeg haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
Everyone.	Qof walba.
But she did not see it.	Laakiin ma ay arag.
I hold myself.	Waxaan isku hayaa.
I can't do anything wrong.	Wax xun ma samayn karo.
No wonder there, really.	La yaab ma leh halkaas, runtii.
Something happened to her.	Wax baa ku dhacay sidii oo kale.
The house was looted.	Guriga waa la dhacay.
There is nothing you can do to stop it.	Wax aad ku joojin karto ma jirto.
I think it will happen here.	Waxaan halkaan u maleynayaa inay dhici doonto.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
So he made money.	Sidaas ayuu lacag ku helay.
They did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
You can believe whatever you like.	Waad rumaysan kartaa wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
Not so long ago, not even that.	Wax badan ka hor ma aha, xitaa taas.
I don't really feel well.	Runtii si fiican uma dareemayo.
It must be present	Waa in la joogo
she will say.	waxay odhan doontaa.
I can see it most of the time.	Inta badan waan arki karaa.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Kaliya ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo.
You told me.	Waad ii sheegtay.
He is a good friend of mine.	Waa saaxiib fiican oo ila ah.
They make a lot of money and a lot of money.	Waxay sameeyaan lacag badan iyo lacag badan.
This was work.	Tani waxay ahayd shaqo.
More than likely, they will not.	In ka badan sida ay u badan tahay, ma ay yeeli doonaan.
It was everything.	Waxay ahayd wax walba.
That it could be anyone she wants.	In ay noqon karto qof kasta oo ay rabto.
They will find you.	Way ku heli doonaan.
There is nothing beautiful, nothing beautiful.	Ma jiraan wax qurux badan, ma jiraan wax qurux badan.
I do not understand how this can be.	Ma fahmin sida ay tani noqon karto.
One of us will.	Mid naga mid ah ayaa doona.
It would be seen as such.	Waxaa loo arki lahaa sida weyn oo kale.
He is happy to have something to do.	Wuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu haysto wax uu sameeyo.
Maybe it was.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd.
I really know this.	Runtii tan waan ogahay.
You can do whatever you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I have never seen anything more beautiful.	Weligay wax ka qurux badan ma arag.
They did not believe me.	Ima ay rumaysan.
That really is true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
I hope, that is enough.	Waxaan rajeynayaa, taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I would like to help	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan caawiyo
As someone said, it is not.	Sida qof sheegay, ma aha.
You do not need to do this here.	Uma baahnid inaan sidaas ku samayno halkan.
I hold myself.	Waan isku hayaa.
I can't stop anymore.	Mar dambe ma joojin karo.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
No one does that.	Qofna taas ma sameeyo.
I have been here for a very long time.	Waxaan halkan joogay wakhti aad u dheer.
I'm not sure why this is.	Ma hubo sababta tani u tahay.
Maybe a few.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay dhowr.
He was not able to see.	Ma uu awoodin inuu arko.
But it was not done.	Laakiin lama samayn.
But, it's bad.	Laakiin, way xun tahay.
It still looks great.	Wali waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
There is a lot going on.	Wax badan baa ka socda.
Everyone knows what to do.	Qof kastaa waa yaqaan waxa la sameeyo.
I think this is an interesting idea.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad xiiso leh.
I didn't know who he was at first.	Maan garanayn qofka uu yahay markii hore.
Something happened to me that was not right.	Wax baa igu dhacay in aanay sax ahayn.
We were friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo.
Nothing so great.	Wax sidaas u weyn maaha.
I hope it will happen.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici doonto.
He said he would come there to help me.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu halkaas u iman doono in uu i caawiyo.
But he decided.	Laakiin wuu go'aansaday.
I felt the same way.	Waxaan dareemay sidaas oo kale.
It was a previous job.	Waxay u ahayd shaqo hore.
It looks like I'm not even there.	Waxay u egtahay in aan xitaa meesha joogin.
I lost the reason for this.	Waan waayay sababta tan.
I did that	Taas waan sameeyay
I don't make much money.	Lacag badan ma helo.
I don't even want to.	Xitaa ma rabo.
Everyone loves him.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay isaga.
I'll talk to you later	Dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa
Tell them what is needed.	U sheeg waxa loo baahan yahay.
They are just.	Waxay yihiin kaliya.
I really want to talk to you.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
No one does.	Qofna ma sameeyo.
He looked back.	Dib ayuu u eegay.
He may not be a very good man.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ahayn nin aad u fiican.
I have seen a lot.	wax badan ayaan arkay.
No one.	Cidna maaha.
Now I do not know if that is true or not.	Hadda ma garanayo inay taasi run tahay iyo in kale.
Very little of that.	Mid aad u yar oo taas ah.
It must be here.	Waa inay halkan joogto.
I saw us.	waan na arkay.
I would do more.	Wax badan ayaan qaban lahaa.
The same with us.	Nala mid ah.
I can't see him.	Ma arki karaa isaga.
He is here now.	Hadda wuu joogaa.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ma rabo inuu hadlo.
But he could not be better.	Laakiin wuu ka fiicnaan waayay.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato inaadan keligaa ahayn.
I do not see that.	Taas ma arko.
It was not a big deal.	Wax weyn ma ahayn.
That is a lie.	Taasi waa been.
He did not come.	Uma uu iman.
I did not know what she was doing.	Ma garanayn waxay samaynayso.
This is a blatant lie.	Tani waa been cad.
I have to do that, too.	Waa inaan sidaas sameeyaa, sidoo kale.
Something else here.	Wax kale halkan.
But he did not do that.	Laakiin taas ma uu samayn.
That's right.	Waa sax.
Now he did not.	Hadda ma uusan samayn.
A little bit.	Wax yar oo yar.
Really, I really did.	Runtii, runtii waan sameeyay.
This is likely to have something true.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inay leedahay wax run ah.
This is not the case.	Tani sidaas maaha.
And free.	Oo lacag la'aan.
It still exists.	Wali wuu jiraa.
I did not know.	Anigu maan garanayn.
I knew what would happen.	Waan ogaa waxa dhici doona.
I think she is here.	Waxaan filayaa inay halkan joogto.
She should know better.	Waa inay si fiican u ogaato.
Although not much.	In kasta oo aan wax badan ahayn.
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
It was this, that, and everything.	Waxay ahayd tan, taas, iyo wax kasta.
I was more than surprised.	In ka badan ayaan yaabay.
As such it is not difficult.	Sida ma aha mid adag.
I never knew who she was.	Weligay maan garanayn cidda ay tahay.
Maybe I was with him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan la joogay isaga.
No one knows how to do that.	Qofna ma garanayo sida taas loo sameeyo.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
It was something she had never seen before.	Waxay ahayd wax aanay hore u arag.
You can't talk about it.	Ma ka hadli kartid.
I have to know.	Waa inaan ogahay.
I was taken away.	Waa la iga qaaday.
There was nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la samayn lahaa ma jirin.
Nice and good.	Si fiican oo wanaagsan.
Is that really weird ???.	ma dhab baa in la yaab leh???.
I wanted to make time.	Waxaan rabay inaan waqti sameeyo.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
She had a lot to say about everything.	Waxay lahayd wax badan oo ay wax walba ka sheegto.
It is up to you.	Adiga ayaa kugu jira.
I have no problem with this.	Wax dhib ah igama helin tan.
I will talk to him.	Waan la hadli doonaa.
Whatever they need, they will get.	Wax kasta oo ay u baahan yihiin, way heli doonaan.
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
You can find more here.	Wax badan ayaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
Otherwise I would not be here.	Haddii kale halkan ma joogi lahaa.
Make an appointment for whatever you want.	U ballan waxaad doonto.
I am here now	hadda waan joogaa
But three times.	Laakiin saddex jeer.
He came out beautiful.	Qurux buu la soo baxay.
She did.	Way samaysay.
Much was right.	In badan ayaa sax ahayd.
He didn’t have much of a chance to go.	Ma haysan fursad badan oo uu ku tago.
We live our best.	Waxaan ku nool nahay sida ugu fiican.
How beautiful!	Sidee qurux badan!
He may tell you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu kuu sheego.
They would not do that.	Ma ay yeeli lahayn taas.
He did not return.	Uma soo noqon.
They will come once.	Waxay iman doonaan hal mar.
It is true or not.	Waa run iyo in kale.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
It will come here	Way iman doontaa halkan
Maybe so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas oo kale tahay.
Where is that? 	Aaway taas?
He looked at me intently.	Aad buu ii eegay.
I think she is a man.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax nin ah.
I have no chance.	Fursad ma haysto.
But it looks strange.	Laakiin waxay u egtahay wax la yaab leh.
I didn't think that would be a problem.	Uma malaynayn inay taasi dhibaato noqon doonto.
This is a lie.	Tani waa been.
What is a new	Maxaa cusub
I am ready to go now.	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan hadda tago.
I think that is it.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay.
And a friend to everyone.	Iyo saaxiib qof walba.
But very little in person.	Laakiin aad ugu yar qofka.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
It is a long time coming.	Waa wakhti dheer oo soo socda.
Maybe that was what she would do.	Malaha taasi waxay ahayd waxay samayn lahayd.
It was a very bad day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u xun.
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
Obviously we need everyone to get married.	Sida iska cad waxaan u baahanahay qof walba inuu is qaado.
How is it said.	Sidee baa loo yidhi.
It will still need time.	Weli waxay u baahan doontaa wakhti.
Very, very difficult.	Aad iyo aad u adag.
But that may not be right.	Laakiin taasi sax ma noqon karto.
I'm really a man.	Runtii waxaan ahay nin.
I hope that is true.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi run tahay.
It will not last long.	Ma sii joogi doono wakhti dheer.
No one could see me there.	Qofna halkaas ima arki karin.
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
He came here yesterday	Shalay ayuu halkan yimid
I was really lucky.	Runtii nasiib ayaan lahaa.
I'm just happy to be here.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo.
Don't tell us anything, you know.	Waxba ha noo sheegin, waad ogtahay.
I was very busy.	Aad ayaan mashquul u ahaa.
That is a problem, but a good one.	Taasi waa dhibaato, laakiin mid wanaagsan.
In fact, it was.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd.
I think she did the right thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay samaysay wax sax ah.
He got what he came for.	Wuu helay wixii uu halkan u yimid.
Obviously there is a lot to work on here.	Si cad waxaa jira wax badan oo halkan lagu shaqeeyo.
I do not know how to do it can not help.	Ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo ma caawin kartaa.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
No one will take it.	Qofna ma qaadan doono.
This is what will happen.	Tani waa waxa dhici doona.
Everyone knows him.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa isaga.
It is the same now.	Waa sidaas oo kale hadda.
I will not take anything.	Waxba qaadan maayo.
He was my favorite person.	Wuxuu ahaa qofka aan jeclahay.
Lots of them.	In badan oo ka mid ah.
No one comes.	Qofna ma yimaado.
Today everyone does that.	Maanta qof kastaa sidaas ayuu sameeyaa.
This is the most common.	Tani waa inta ugu badan.
I love being here	Waxaan jeclahay inaan halkaan joogo
Lots of similar things.	Waxyaabo badan oo la mid ah.
But really, it can be anything.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
She did, a bit.	Way samaysay, xoogaa.
I'm sure they are.	Waan hubaa inay yihiin.
The other.	Ka kale.
This would be a great room.	Tani waxay noqon lahayd qolka weyn.
You really had me.	Runtii waad i lahayd.
I got a lot of things.	Waxaan helay waxyaabo badan.
I am not, really.	Anigu ma ihi, runtii.
Now that was beautiful.	Hadda taasi waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
Everyone wants it.	Qof kastaa wuu rabaa.
I keep it all over the house.	Waxaan ku hayaa guriga oo dhan.
She would do it.	Way yeeli lahayd.
It is good for me.	Way ii fiican tahay aniga.
I get nothing.	Waxba ma helo.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
It looks very small.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid aad u yar.
Even this does not seem too bad.	Xitaa tani uma eka mid aad u xun.
Nothing really.	Waxba run ahaantii.
I knew what it would be like.	Waan ogaa waxa ay noqon doonto.
I knew it all.	Aniga oo dhan waan ogaa.
Definitely several times.	Dhab ahaantii dhowr jeer.
I can tell you more now.	In badan ayaan kuu sheegi karaa hadda.
Not sure how to get it.	Ma hubo sida loo helo.
We were ready to do that.	Waxaan diyaar u ahayn inaan taas samayno.
Runtii run uma eka.	Runtii run uma eka.
It is a difficult place.	Waa meel adag.
What do you think?	Maxaad u malaynaysaa?
No one can.	Nin ma awoodo.
It happened to everyone.	Qof walba ku dhacay.
Any chance tonight.	Fursad kasta caawa.
No one can find the best for me, he thought.	Qofna igama heli karo waxa ugu fiican, ayuu u maleeyay.
This is great.	Tani waa mid aad u weyn.
But it no longer exists.	Laakiin hadda ma sii jirto.
I was amazed at how big the house was.	Waxaan la yaabay sida uu guriga u weyn yahay.
But it was not one.	Laakiin mid ma ahayn.
If so, that's a good idea.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, waa fikrad wanaagsan.
No one knows where you are.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha aad joogto.
I do not know why, but it is.	Ma garanayo sababta, laakiin wuu yahay.
What will it be, will it be.	Maxay noqon doontaa, waxay noqon doontaa.
He would say what he felt was true.	Wuxuu odhan lahaa waxa uu dareemay inay run yihiin.
That obviously is very small.	Taasi cad waa mid aad u yar.
It's new to me.	Waa igu cusub.
What a wonderful place!	Waa maxay meel yaab leh!
You can't go anywhere else.	Meel kale ma aadi kartid.
Something terrible happened there.	Wax aad u xun ayaa halkaas ka dhacay.
A little too hard.	Xoogaa aad u adag.
He thought he just had it.	Wuxuu mooday inuu haysto oo kaliya.
She will be able to help you.	Waxay awoodi doontaa inay ku caawiso.
That is not so much.	Taasi maaha mid aad u badan.
We love to be.	Waxaan jecel nahay inaan nahay.
This is not a good job.	Tani maaha shaqo wanaagsan.
I do.	waan sameeyaa.
I would take it	Maan qaadan lahaa
No one here would do that.	Ma jiro qof halkan samayn lahaa taas.
It was no longer the same.	Mar dambe isku mid ma ahayn.
But she did not go.	Laakiin way tagi wayday.
I had to find a new job.	Waxay ahayd inaan shaqo cusub helo.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
It was like that.	Waxay ahayd sidaas oo kale.
I could not see	Ma arki karin
I didn't like him at all.	Waxba maan jeclayn isaga.
He did, for a while.	Wuu sameeyay, in muddo ah.
But that is correct.	Laakiin taasi waa sax.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
I went out and there.	Waan baxay iyo halkaas.
But it is difficult, very difficult.	Laakiin waa adag tahay, aad u adag.
He would do anything.	Wax walba wuu samayn lahaa.
This will not go away.	Tani ma bixi doonto.
It really is something.	Runtii waa wax.
Many are right.	In badan ayaa sax ah.
Maybe more than a year.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan hal sano.
Who is new.	Yaa cusub.
We can't stay here.	Halkan kuma joogi karno.
She is smart.	Way caqli badan tahay.
It would be done.	Waa la samayn lahaa.
Something happened to me.	Wax igu soo dhacay.
Probably the same as everything else here.	Malaha waa la mid sida wax kasta oo kale oo halkan ah.
I wonder what came out of it.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ka soo baxay.
You can help, too.	Waad ku caawin kartaa, sidoo kale.
I think that is enough.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ku filan tahay.
It includes.	Waxaa ka mid ah .
I wanted money	Waxaan rabay lacag
Just you there.	Kaliya aad halkaas.
She had something.	Wax bay lahayd.
I don't want anything	waxba ma rabo
I thought you were better than that.	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad taas ka fiican tahay.
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
I took something.	Wax baan qaatay.
I need a job.	Waxaan rabaa shaqo.
This was really a bad idea.	Runtii tani waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
You did nothing.	Waxba ma aadan samayn.
It took time.	Waqti ayuu qaatay.
I couldn't help myself.	Waan is caawin waayay.
He would need a lot of money.	Wuxuu u baahan lahaa lacag badan.
He saw what it was.	Wuu arkay waxa ay tahay.
You have to stay here with us.	Waa inaad halkan nala joogto.
But it can be better if she wants to.	Laakiin way fiicnaan kartaa haddii ay rabto.
This is not like anywhere else.	Tani maaha sida meel kale.
You know this is true.	Waad ogtahay in tani run tahay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
He looked very small.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u yar.
I wanted more than ever to leave here.	Waxa aan rabay in ka badan in aan halkan ka tago.
This looks good.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
Not much, really.	Ma badna, runtii.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I wanted to see it all.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko waxa oo dhan.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax fiican.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
Everything is as it should be.	Wax walba waa sidii la rabay.
That is missing.	Taasi waa la waayay.
And soon.	Oo dhawaan.
She refused to talk to me.	Way ii diiday inaan la hadlo.
It was me.	Aniga waxay ahayd.
I'm glad you said that friend.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad sidaas tidhi saaxiib.
I want to be something.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax noqdo.
It was just.	Waxay ahayd kaliya.
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
Everyone does, most of the time.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa, inta badan.
Everyone believes.	Qof kastaa wuu rumaysan yahay.
It may not be so bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan aad u xun.
There is nothing to do.	Wax la sameeyo ma jiraan.
He never did that.	Waligiis ma uu samayn taas.
he could not find.	wuu heli waayay.
It really is a bad idea.	Runtii waa fikrad xun.
Not so today.	Maanta sidaas maaha.
That is how to be sure.	Taasi waa sida la hubo inta la hubo.
Can anyone help please ???.	Qofna ma caawin karaa fadlan???.
But he knew it would be a lie.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inay been noqon doonto.
It's great, really.	Way weyn tahay, runtii.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
Much more.	Wax badan oo kale.
People have already been robbed.	Dadka mar hore waa la dhacay.
You were.	Waxaad ahayd.
A very different place.	Meel aad u kale.
I say always.	Waxaan leeyahay mar walba.
You need this.	Waxaad u baahan tahay tan.
Maybe it's too early.	Malaha waa hore.
Something strange is happening there.	Wax yaab leh ayaa halkaas ka socda.
This has long been known.	Tan waa hore ayaa la ogaa.
This is even true when you have to know it well.	Tani xitaa waa run marka ay tahay inaad si fiican u ogaato.
A lot is better.	Wax badan ayaa wanaagsan.
I think it would help us.	Waxaan filayaa inay na caawin lahayd.
I no longer like him.	Mar dambe ma jecli isaga.
I think less.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in ka yar.
That is so beautiful.	Taasi waa mid aad u qurux badan.
She loves him.	Way jeceshahay isaga.
I hope this is so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay sidaas tahay.
Everyone was a friend.	Qof walba saaxiib buu ahaa.
was not present.	ma joogin.
I want you to do it	Waxaan rabaa inaad sameyso
A good time is for sure !.	Waqti fiican waa hubaal!.
I had a good time, for sure.	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay, hubaal.
I know he was.	Waan ogahay inuu ahaa.
You can even cook it.	Xitaa waad karin kartaa.
It will not be beautiful.	Ma noqon doonto qurux.
But only if you want to.	Laakiin kaliya haddii aad rabto.
I say they do.	Waxaan leeyahay way sameeyaan.
Not everyone wanted it.	Ma ahan in qof walba uu rabay.
I am not like you	Adiga oo kale ma ihi
They are too much for him.	Aad bay u badan yihiin isaga.
That is very rare.	Taasi aad bay u yar tahay.
We would do it.	Waanu yeeli lahayn.
In fact, another.	Dhab ahaantii, mid kale.
He had no money.	Wax lacag ah ma uu haysan.
Hard and close.	Adag oo dhow.
They need us now.	Hadda way noo baahan yihiin.
Few saw that coming.	In yar baa arkay in soo socda.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
I have to go, you said.	Waa inaan tago, waxaad tidhi.
As you are.	Sida aad tahay.
Now he says so.	Hadda oo sidaas yidhi.
She will see that.	Way arki doontaa taas.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
There is nothing new about that.	Ma jiraan wax ku cusub taas.
But she would.	Laakiin way yeeli lahayd.
I thought you liked me.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad i jeceshahay.
Close to him.	Ku dhow isaga.
Did you know they exist.	Ma ogtahay inay jiraan.
And as he knew.	Iyo sida uu ku ogaa.
Berri is arag !.	Berri is arag!.
If someone could help, it would be great.	Haddii qof uu caawin karo, way fiicnaan lahayd.
What happened to you was true.	Waxa kugu dhacay run bay ahayd.
No one here has ever seen a car.	Ma jiro qof halkan waligiis arkay baabuur.
he says.	wuxuu leeyahay.
It's so great.	Waa sidaas weyn.
I think it's nothing.	Waxaan filayaa in aanay waxba ahayn.
But that is a lie.	Laakiin taasi waa been.
I love them all, I love them.	Waan jeclahay dhammaan, waan jeclahay.
But there was no time.	Laakiin waqti ma jirin.
And now that's enough.	Oo hadda taas ku filan.
Not yet, not yet.	Weli ma aha, ma ahan.
From somewhere else.	Meel kale ka yimid.
We would do it.	Waanu samayn lahayn.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
He was a very good man to work for.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u fiican oo loo shaqeeyo.
What was it.	Maxay ahayd.
As you were.	Sida aad ahayd.
I didn't want to see it.	Ma rabin inaan arko.
He would love to be here today.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan joogo maanta.
Not everyone is lucky.	Qof kastaa maaha mid nasiib badan.
I didn't say I would.	Ma odhan waan yeeli doonaa.
As bad as any.	Sida xun sida mid kasta.
It will not be beautiful.	Ma noqon doonto mid qurux badan.
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
This will be very difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
I do a lot.	Wax badan ayaan sameeyaa.
It really didn't help	Runtii waxba ma caawin
You would love it, for sure.	Waad jeclaan lahayd, hubaal.
Have few friends.	Leh saaxiibo yar.
But they do too.	Laakiin sidoo kale way sameeyaan.
And I need it urgently.	Oo si degdeg ah ayaan ugu baahanahay.
Surely that will help.	Hubaal in taasi caawin doonto.
We are out.	Waa nala soo baxay.
It will be so.	Waxay ahaan doontaa sidaas.
There was nowhere to go.	Ma jirin meel la aado.
I just got that idea.	Kaliya waxaan ka helay taas fikrad ahaan.
Smart, too.	Mid caqli badan, sidoo kale.
But it is there.	Laakiin waa halkaas.
The best thing you can do is what you did.	Waxa ugu fiican ee aad samayn karto waa waxa aad samaysay.
Take one idea.	Hal fikrad qaado.
I like to talk.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan hadlo.
There were no cars.	Wax baabuur ah ma jirin.
That is very bad.	Taasi aad bay u xun tahay.
that's what you said.	sidaas ayaad sheegtay .
And another.	Iyo mid kale.
I didn't even tell anyone.	Xitaa qofna uma sheegin.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
There is no place like home.	Meel guriga la mid ah ma jirto.
This should also be done here.	Tani waa in sidoo kale halkan lagu sameeyaa.
I didn’t think so much.	Uma malaynayn in aad u badan.
And everywhere else.	Iyo meel kasta oo kale.
We really need some work here.	Dhab ahaantii halkan waxaan uga baahanahay xoogaa shaqo ah.
She was the right person.	Waxay ahayd qof sax ah.
It is a job.	Waa shaqo.
Every day a new problem.	Maalin kasta dhibaato cusub.
What is it! 	Waa maxay!
It's the same here.	Waa la mid halkan.
Don't leave me.	Ha iga bixin.
It was really good for me.	Runtii waxay ii ahayd wax wanaagsan.
He no longer loved me.	Mar dambe ima jeclayn.
It doesn't look like anything.	Waxba uma eka.
I love that	Waan jeclahay sidaas
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
I wanted more than I had.	Waxa aan rabay in ka badan waxa aan haysto.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
I like!.	waan jeclahay!.
As he had.	Sida uu lahaa.
There is so much more and so little.	Waxaa jira wax aad u badan oo aad u yar.
I took some time.	Waxaan qaatay xoogaa waqti ah.
It sounds complicated, but it is not.	Waxay u egtahay mid adag, laakiin maaha.
what is it to me	waa maxay aniga
I just don't understand why you want to do this.	Kaliya ma fahmin sababta aad u rabto inaad tan sameyso.
No one likes to be left out.	Qofna ma jecla in wax laga tago.
Few even tried it.	In yar ayaa xitaa isku dayay.
As expected.	Sida loo malaynayo.
Do not leave until you are lucky.	Ha ka tagin ilaa nasiib.
He could not find it immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u heli waayay.
What a great idea.	Waa maxay fikrad fiican.
He is tough.	Wuu adag yahay.
Both are very complex.	Labaduba aad bay u adag yihiin.
I'm lucky	nasiib ayaan leeyahay
I think you did.	Waxaan filayaa inaad samaysay.
But don't tell me what to eat.	Laakiin ha ii sheegin waxaan cuno.
I thought they loved me.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay i jecel yihiin.
It's fine, but it's even bigger if you don't have a car.	Way fiican tahay, laakiin way ka sii weyn tahay haddii aadan baabuur haysan.
No problem if you tell them now.	Wax dhib ah malaha haddii aad hadda u sheegto.
He didn't even speak.	Xitaa wuu hadli waayay.
Obviously, this will take time.	Sida cad, tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
I had nowhere to go.	Meel aan ka baxo ma jirin.
He promised he would.	Wuxuu ballan qaaday inuu sameyn doono.
That is what will come of it.	Taasi waa waxa ka iman doona.
He knew that, if anyone did.	Wuu ogaa taas, haddii qof uu sameeyo.
are you ready?.	diyaar ma tahay?.
Good stuff here	Waxyaabo fiican halkan
It is one I love very much.	Waa mid aan aad u jeclahay.
I know you do.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyso.
Don't go there.	Halkaas ha tagin.
tell me what you want.	ii sheeg waxaad rabto.
I have no idea how.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida.
But they did not come.	Laakiin ma ay iman.
But it may not be.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay noqon.
What's up? 	Maxaa jira?
I will do this.	Waan qaban doonaa kan.
You may not know this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan taas ogayn.
I'm sorry but it's true.	Waan ka xumahay laakiin waa run.
I think we will see.	Waxaan filayaa inaan arki doono.
I think they are a good thing.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay yihiin wax wanaagsan.
Not the least.	Ma ugu yar.
I love how hard it is.	Waxaan jeclahay sida ay u adag tahay.
But no one else did.	Laakiin qof kale ma samayn.
Do not stop doing it.	Ha u joojin inuu sameeyo.
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
There is no one, not me.	Qofna ma jiro, oo aan ku jiro.
He says it is not true.	Waxa uu yidhi run maaha.
I tried to do something.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax sameeyo.
The latter does not look happy to see him again.	Kan dambe uma eka mid faraxsan inuu mar kale arko.
No one helped with the school work.	Qofna kama caawin shaqada dugsiga.
At first, it was not true.	Marka hore, run ma ahayn.
I would not go home	Guriga ma aadi lahaa
As if it were me.	Sida haddii ay aniga tahay.
This is not just an idea, this is real.	Tani maaha kaliya fikrad, tani waa dhab.
And it's not just an idea.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya fikrad.
I have to help	Waa inaan caawiyo
There is little else.	Wax kale oo yar baa jira.
I really don't know what is best.	Runtii ma garanayo waxa ugu wanaagsan.
Maybe a little bit.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xoogaa yar.
I would like to know what it is.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado waxa ay tahay.
I think this is very difficult.	Waxaan u maleynayaa arrintan si aad u adag.
Until recently, no one knew who he was.	Ilaa dhawaan, qofna ma garanayn cidda uu yahay.
I don’t think there is more we can do about that.	Uma maleynayo inay jiraan wax ka badan oo aan sameyn karno taas.
I need money to buy food.	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag aan cunto ku iibsado.
I think it will take a long time.	Waxaan filayaa inay qaadan doonto waqti dheer.
But not much.	Laakiin uma badna.
Whatever you like.	Wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
You would need	Waxaad u baahan lahayd
Until she didn't do it.	Ilaa ay ka yeeli wayday.
Run hard.	Run adag.
I know you can't talk about it.	Waan ogahay inaadan ka hadli karin.
Then there are people.	Ka dib waxaa jira dadka.
He is still there.	Wali ma joogo.
It will be three.	Waxay noqon doontaa saddex.
It was all she needed.	Waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee ay u baahan lahayd.
I can't do much	Wax badan ma qaban karo
They will not come.	Ma iman doonaan.
He left and left everything.	Wuu baxay oo wax walba ka tagay.
Something good.	Wax fiican.
You did the right thing.	Waxaad samaysay wax sax ah.
Something happened here recently.	Wax baa halkan ka dhacay dhawaan.
I will not believe that.	Ma rumaysan doono taas.
I am very sorry.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay.
Also, a little too long.	Sidoo kale, wax yar ayaa aad u dheer.
I know she has it for me.	Waan ogahay inay ii leedahay.
he will say.	wuxuu odhan doonaa.
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
But we would happen to something much worse.	Laakiin waxaan ku dhici lahayn wax aad uga xun.
It is not interesting anymore.	Ma aha wax xiiso leh mar dambe.
Something delayed him.	Wax baa isaga dib u dhigay.
He was tall and handsome.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dheer oo qurux badan.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
He did this just as before.	Wuxuu tan u sameeyay isla sidii kii hore oo kale.
Don't take me seriously.	Si dhab ah ha ii qaadan.
Everything really.	Wax walba runtii.
But he was clearly.	Laakiin si cad ayuu ahaa.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
No one was present.	Qofna ma joogin.
I was not able to do it.	Ma awoodin inaan sameeyo.
So much as one.	Aad u badan sida mid ka mid ah.
No one will help you with this.	Qofna kuma caawin doono arrintan.
But he did not tell anyone.	Laakiin cidna uma uu sheegin.
It's hard to do.	Way adag tahay in la sameeyo.
The victim.	Kii wax ku noqday.
You can get it	Waad heli kartaa
He applied for the job without success.	Waxa uu codsaday shaqada isaga oo aan ku guulaysan.
Do not talk to me.	Ha ila hadlin.
I don't seem to be working on anything.	Uma eka in aan wax ku shaqeeyo.
She said that would be nice.	Waxay tidhi taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I thought he did.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu sameeyay.
It is very popular.	Aad baa loo jecel yahay.
Very hard, but very small.	Aad u adag, laakiin aad u yar.
They will see that.	Way arki doonaan taas.
Give food.	Sii cunto.
But not everything.	Laakiin wax walba maaha.
She really did.	Runtii way tidhi.
As if he never wanted anything.	Sida inuusan waligiis rabin wax.
I would like to know that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas ogaado.
But there were many things.	Laakiin waxaa jiray waxyaabo badan.
I have never seen this before.	Tan hore uma arag.
I doubt she really likes me.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay runtii i jeceshahay.
I just want to say.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sheego.
You do not need	Uma baahnid
Near school.	Dugsiga u dhow.
She loves him.	Way jeceshahay isaga.
I was unable to do it any other way.	Ma awoodin in aan sameeyo si kale.
I would like to talk to you today.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan la hadlo maanta.
People without food.	Dadka aan cunto lahayn.
He did this.	Tani wuu sameeyay.
I loved it.	Waan jeclaan jiray.
Only he knew he was real.	Isaga kaliya ayaa ogaa inuu dhab yahay.
He saw only one man.	Waxa uu arkay kaliya hal nin.
I'm not sure what happened now.	Ma hubo hadda waxa ku dhacay.
Not how much you do, but how often.	Ma aha inta aad wax samaynayso, laakiin inta jeer.
But maybe that's the way it is.	Laakiin malaha taasi waa sidaas oo kale.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
He was not smart.	Caqli ma lahayn.
I was surprised by a new one.	Mid cusub ayaan la yaabay.
I don't want it here	halkan kuma rabo
This was not a problem.	Tani dhib ma lahayn.
They do bad things.	Wax xun bay sameeyaan.
I have always been.	Had iyo jeer waan ahay.
But no one really knows.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo runtii.
Trouble, that.	Dhib, taasi.
I can't even be a friend.	Xitaa saaxiib ma noqon karo.
Not very good	Aad uma fiican
But not much.	Laakiin maaha wax badan.
There is no constant time for me.	Ma jiro wakhti joogto ah aniga.
I know you are taller than me.	Waan ogahay inaad iga dheer tahay.
This is correct.	Tani waa sax.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
But it really was.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii wuu ahaa.
But it can be anything.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa wax walba.
Maybe a little less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax yar ka yar.
I am so glad you are here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto.
Not too bad.	Aad uma badna si xun.
It is given.	Waa la siiyay.
He said he would see what he could get.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu arki doono waxa uu heli karo.
She did not understand why he was there.	Ma ay fahmin sababta uu halkaas u joogo.
There was nothing so bad that he could not be trusted.	Ma jirin wax aad u xun oo isaga la rumaysan karo.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I felt strongly.	Waxaan dareemay si adag.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
It's too big.	Aad buu u weyn yahay.
It will not stop	Ma joojin doono
But that is a small thing.	Laakiin taasi waa wax yar.
Another surprise for you.	Yaab kale adiga.
Give it a chance.	Wax fursad sii.
Let me know if he needs anything.	I soo sheeg haddii uu wax u baahan yahay.
To this day, they do not know.	Ilaa maanta, ma ay garanayn.
I don't feel it.	Ma dareemayo.
I still don't have it.	Wali ma hayo.
Really, really unimaginable.	Runtii, runtii wax aan la malayn karin.
It was everywhere.	Waxay ahayd meel kasta.
This, not much.	Tani, maaha wax badan.
Until you did it again.	Ilaa aad mar kale samaysay.
And now, out.	Oo hadda, baxay.
He tried to speak.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu hadlo.
That was a lie.	Taasi waxay ahayd been.
It wasn't much.	Wax badan ma ahayn.
That was beautiful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
A man came out shortly after.	Nin baa wax yar ka dib soo baxay.
I have to say that most of the time, it does.	Waa inaan sheego in inta badan, ay sameyso.
He might do the same tomorrow, too.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu sidaas oo kale sameeyo berrito, sidoo kale.
I don't want any problems	Ma rabto wax dhibaato ah
I think it's close enough.	Waxaan filayaa inay ku filan tahay dhow.
I went to talk to him.	Waxaan u tagay inaan la hadlo.
I didn’t have time to wonder why.	Ma aanan helin waqti aan la yaabanahay sababta.
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
Nothing new was found.	Ma jirin wax cusub oo la helay.
This is a great place.	Tani waa meel aad u fiican.
He looked a lot.	In badan ayuu eegay.
I think this is a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay wax wanaagsan.
To be with me.	Inuu ila joogo.
He took it seriously.	Si dhab ah ayuu u qaatay.
Otherwise it is not.	Haddii kale ma aha.
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
For you, you didn't do it right.	Adiga, ma aadan samayn oo sax maaha.
Who clearly felt that everything was fine.	Yaa si cad u dareemay in wax walba ay wanaagsan yihiin.
It was a beautiful time.	Waxay ahayd waqti qurux badan.
Unless otherwise noted.	Haddii aan si kale loo sheegin.
It was big, but beautiful.	Wuxuu ahaa mid weyn, laakiin qurux badan.
Give and take.	Sii oo qaado.
The same.	Taas la mid ah.
She did something.	Wax bay samaysay.
That is, so far.	Taasi waa, ilaa hadda.
Maybe a little less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax yar ka yar.
I wish I had and have.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto oo aan haysto.
Very beautiful, he thought.	Aad u qurux badan, ayuu u maleeyay.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I think it is now.	Waxaan filayaa inay hadda tahay.
It's bad now.	Waa wax xun hadda.
They all do the same thing.	Dhammaan waxay sameeyaan wax la mid ah.
She should have been here.	Waxay ahayd inay halkan joogto.
What a problem!	Maxaa dhib ah!
It is difficult to say for sure.	Way adag tahay in si hubaal ah loo sheego.
You will need to do it one by one.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad mid mid u samayso.
She can't come back now.	Hadda dib uma soo noqon karto.
It probably is nothing.	Waxay u badan tahay in aanay waxba ahayn.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
You know, how you like it.	Waad ogtahay, sida aad jeceshahay.
Clearly bad.	Si cad u xun.
But I will do that today.	Laakiin maanta sidaas ayaan samayn doonaa.
Both were purchased.	Labaduba waa la iibsaday.
It is everywhere.	Waa meel walba.
I do not	ma samaynayo
Get to know him better.	Si fiican u yaqaan isaga.
I'll tell you friend.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa saaxiib.
Stop anything.	Waxba ku jooji.
Who will be the best?	Yaa noqon doona kan ugu fiican?
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
It is not an opportunity.	Fursad ma aha.
He wondered why she was so serious.	Waxa uu la yaabay sababta ay aad uga dhab tahay.
Probably not much.	Malaha wax badan.
I just say.	Kaliya waxaan leeyahay.
Enough now.	Ku filan hadda.
It can be very interesting.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Still, it's beautiful, don't you think?	Weli, waa qurux, miyaadan u malaynayn?
Let me tell you something else.	Wax kale aan kuu sheego.
I wonder what will happen now.	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa dhici doona hadda.
This will not be the same as always.	Tani ma ahaan doonto sida mar kasta oo kale.
Really not sure.	Runtii ma hubo.
That was what she had to do.	Taasi waxay ahayd in ay samayso.
I will be there soon.	Waxaan halkaas joogi doonaa dhawaan.
I am in it	waan ku jiraa
That is where he came from.	Waa halka uu ka yimid.
But it’s like everything is done.	Laakiin waa sida wax kasta oo la sameeyo.
Far from me.	Iga dheer.
It was beautiful, very beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux, aad u qurux badan.
He is new here	Wuu ku cusub yahay halkan
He should have come back now.	Waxay ahayd inuu hadda soo noqdo.
That is not wise.	Taasi caqli maaha.
I do not know why, but it is true.	Ma garanayo sababta, laakiin waa run.
I know who he is.	Waan garanayaa qofka uu yahay.
Same idea.	Fikrad la mid ah.
But he still got in.	Laakiin weli wuu galay.
No one should find him here.	Qofna waa inuusan halkan ka helin isaga.
I did nothing.	waxba maan samayn.
What it looks like.	Sida ay u egtahay.
It was an unspeakable beauty.	Waxay ahayd qurux aan la odhan karin.
I wondered what was going on.	Waxaan la yaabay waxa jira.
Lots of money.	Lacag badan.
what is that 	waa maxay taasi?
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
That would do well.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd si fiican.
Not much is true.	Wax badan sax maaha.
I know you are happy.	Waan ogahay inaad ku faraxsan tahay.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
He appeared.	Wuxuu u muuqday.
Lots of money.	Lacag badan.
Now don't tell anyone.	Hadda cidna ha u sheegin.
I will not take the job.	Ma qaadan doono shaqada.
I think this is not true.	Waxaan filayaa in tani aysan sax ahayn.
I can see.	Ma arki kartid.
I wanted to make one, too.	Waxaan rabay inaan mid sameeyo, sidoo kale.
Less today.	In ka yar maanta.
He is close here.	Wuu ku dhow yahay halkan.
He was given every opportunity.	Waxaa la siiyay fursad kasta.
He is very sure.	Aad ayuu u hubaa.
He did that.	Taas wuu sameeyay.
I can really talk to you	Runtii waan kula hadli karaa
I think he is fine.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu fiican yahay.
Surprisingly, you know.	Wax yaab leh, waad ogtahay.
The best place to shop	Meesha ugu fiican ee wax laga iibsado
I just can't go.	Ma tagi karo oo kaliya.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan.
Like, real, real.	Sida, mid dhab ah, mid dhab ah.
There is so much to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
This is good.	Tani waa mid wanaagsan.
I have always been a beautiful person.	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa qof qurux badan.
It is very good too.	Aad bay u fiican tahay sidoo kale.
I wanted a bit.	Waxaan rabay xoogaa.
She was a person.	Waxay ahayd qof.
The person you can talk to.	Qofka aad la hadli karto.
But there is something else, too.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax kale, sidoo kale.
That is why she is here.	Waa sababta ay halkan u joogto.
The reason.	Sababta.
She would leave now.	Way ka tagi lahayd hadda.
I really like to go	Runtii waan jeclahay inaan aado
It was not.	Ma lahayn.
He doesn't get there.	Halkaas kuma uu helo.
I don't know who owned the former, really.	Ma garanayo kii lahaa kii hore, runtii.
I do not feel well today.	Maanta si fiican uma dareemayo.
How amazing!	Sidee la yaab leh!
I have never seen anything less.	Weligay wax ka yar ma arag.
He should not.	Ma ahayn inuu.
But he can say little.	Laakiin wax yar ayuu ka odhan karaa.
No one is present.	Qofna ma joogo.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
I was amazed like everyone else.	Waxaan la yaabay sida qof kasta.
Not so.	Wax sidaas maaha.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan.
She is as beautiful as she is.	Way u qurux badan tahay sida ay tahay.
Everyone told him.	Qof kastaa wuu u sheegay.
I found.	waan helay.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I am here.	Aniga waa joogaa.
Not that thing.	Ma aha in wax.
If nothing else, there was everything to be done.	Haddii aysan jirin wax, waxaa jiray wax kasta oo la sameeyo.
You can find it at the door.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa albaabka.
Do you think it will succeed?	Ma kula tahay inay guulaysan doonto?
You will find me.	Waad i heli doontaa.
I did.	waan sameeyay.
That first.	Taas marka hore.
He was smart and tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid caqli badan oo adag.
Before most people.	Ka hor inta badan dadka.
He does this sometimes.	Mar mar ayuu taas sameeyaa.
What else do I need to do here?	Maxaa kale oo aan u baahanahay inaan halkan ku sameeyo.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
It is the same time.	Waa waqti isku mid ah.
They may not think so.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay u malayn.
I was not there.	Halkaas ma aan joogin.
I will always love you.	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa.
No one really does.	Qofna runtii ma sameeyo.
I'm still not sure what to do about it.	Wali ma hubo waxa aan ka samaynayo.
Maybe I did something else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax kale sameeyay.
It will take people.	Waxay qaadan doontaa dadka.
He was smart enough to come back.	Wuxuu ahaa caqli ku filan inuu soo noqdo.
He really could not do that.	Runtii taas ma uu samayn karin.
It is for everyone.	Waa qof walba.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida uu yahay.
I got it now.	Hadda ayaan helay.
I just refused.	Kaliya waan diiday.
It would be nice if it were you.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii ay adiga ahaan lahayd.
I have not seen it in person.	Qof ahaan ma arag.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
I had a great day.	Waxaan lahaa maalin weyn.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
They are common.	Waxay ku badan yihiin.
He's a smart guy, you know.	Waa nin caqli badan, waad ogtahay.
Something inside me refused to do it.	Wax igu jira ayaa diiday inaan sameeyo.
Obviously, someone had.	Sida iska cad, qof baa lahaa.
Don't leave me here.	Halkan ha iga tagin.
No problems were found	Wax dhibaato ah lama arag
One knows the other.	Mid baa mid kale yaqaan.
It will be very difficult.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
She should not have done this.	Ma ahayn inay tan samayso.
It was very still there.	Waxay ahayd mid aad weli halkaas.
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
I thought it was very good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u fiican tahay.
Something very bad.	Wax aad u xun.
I can't find anything like that.	Waxba sidaas uma heli karo.
In fact, he did not even know why he was there.	Dhab ahaantii, xitaa ma uu garanayn sababta uu halkaas u joogo.
He returned.	Wuu u soo noqday.
I haven't seen him in a while.	In muddo ah maan arag isaga.
She needs a car.	Waxay u baahan tahay baabuur.
There was something in it.	Wax baa ku jiray.
Everyone knows.	Qof walba wuu garanayaa.
That is not surprising enough.	Taasi maaha wax yaab leh oo ku filan.
He gave me nothing.	Waxba igama siin.
And certainly not friends.	Oo hubaal maaha saaxiibo.
They are still very numerous.	Weli aad bay u badan yihiin.
That is not true.	Runtii taasi run maaha.
After that you will be alone.	Taas ka dib adiga keligaa ayaad ahaan doontaa.
I don't want to leave you.	Ma rabo inaan kaa tago.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
Really? 	Dhab ahaantii?
He knew.	Wuu ogaa.
But there is still time.	Laakiin weli waqti ayaa jira.
I want to see more.	Waxaan rabaa in aan wax badan arko.
You can do anything, there.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta, halkaas.
Not everyone can.	Qof walba ma awoodo.
This cannot happen	Tani ma dhici karto
Sure,	Hubaal,
I left.	Waan ka baxay.
I have never seen a room.	Weligay qolka maan arag.
It may be a lack of food.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay cunto la'aan.
Great promise.	Ballan weyn.
It was a good job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo fiican.
I think you are very smart.	Waxaan filayaa inaad aad u caqli badan tahay.
He looked like it was food.	Wuxuu u eegay sidii inay cunto tahay.
It is too early.	Waa goor hore.
And he was a very handsome man.	Oo wuxuu ahaa nin aad u qurux badan.
That is work.	Taasi waa shaqo.
He would have already done so.	Waxa uu hore u samayn lahaa sida.
I will tell him more, too.	Wax badan ayaan u sheegi doonaa isaga, sidoo kale.
I am not one of them.	Ma aha wax aan ka mid ahay.
You love it	Waad jeceshahay
This was something new for me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd wax igu cusub.
There was no food.	Cunto ma jirin.
He looked at it quickly.	Degdeg buu u eegay.
That was not wise.	Taasi caqli ma ahayn.
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
What harm can it do?	Maxaa dhib ah oo ay sameyn kartaa?
I think we are too.	Waxaan filayaa in aanu sidoo kale nahay.
I think he.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu.
I hope to see you there.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaas kugu arko.
He does not want to leave yet.	Ma doonayo in uu weli baxo.
A lot really.	Wax badan oo run ahaantii.
I did not have.	Maan lahayn.
He was just amazing.	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya yaab.
Do not say anything.	Waxba ha odhan.
That was until they left.	Taasi waxay ahayd ilaa inta ay tagi doonaan.
He saw something coming.	Waxa uu arkay wax soo socda.
I don't have to do this.	Ma aha inaan tan sameeyo.
He never got it.	Waligiis ma helin.
No one likes him.	Qofna isaga ma jecla.
A little while ago, it was unimaginable.	Wax yar ka hor, waxay ahayd wax aan la malayn karin.
I want another chance.	Waxaan rabaa fursad kale.
Maybe someone worse.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof ka xun.
They love it.	Way jecel yihiin.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
Just like yesterday.	Sida shalay oo kale.
Maybe even one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa in mid la helo.
Still alive and everything.	Wali nool iyo wax walba.
There was nothing to buy.	Ma jirin wax la iibsado.
As well as other people in the house.	Sidoo kale dadka kale ee guriga.
We are ready when you are.	Waxaan diyaar u nahay marka aad tahay.
I don’t even want to do it.	Xitaa ma doonayo inaan sameeyo.
He looked at something.	Wax buu eegay.
This was truly a beautiful day.	Runtii tani waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
This is what you will be, what will happen to you.	Tani waa waxa aad ahaan doonto, maxaa kugu dhici doona.
For me this is not wise.	Aniga ahaan tani caqli maaha.
I was surprised.	yaab baan u qaaday.
He would get that.	Taas wuu heli lahaa.
It did not turn out well.	Si fiican uma ay noqon.
A good person.	Qof wanaagsan.
It can be anyone, anywhere.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta, meel kasta.
Nothing came of it.	Waxba kama iman.
These are terrible things.	Waa waxyaabo aad u xun.
I was there	Halkaas ayaan joogay
I am very sorry	aad baan uga xumahay
He knows he can do it.	Wuu ogyahay inuu samayn karo.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
I really can't do that now.	Runtii taas ma samayn karo hadda.
they do not like you.	kuma jecel yihiin.
Tell people what you did.	U sheeg dadka waxaad samaysay.
I thought it was you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga.
That was a good thing to see.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan in la arko.
I did	waan sameeyay
I hope you are well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad si fiican u fiican tahay.
No one could believe it.	Qofna ma rumaysan karin.
I tried everything I was unlucky here.	Waxaan isku dayay wax kasta oo halkan aan nasiib lahayn.
It really was a good job.	Runtii waxay ahayd shaqo fiican.
I looked again.	Mar kale ayaan eegay.
They are beautiful	Way qurux badan yihiin
But he knew.	Laakiin wuu ogaa.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
Each of us.	Qof kasta oo naga mid ah.
Anyone who might know it is already gone.	Qof kasta oo laga yaabo inuu garanayo waa hore ayuu tagay.
I think the rest will come.	Waxaan filayaa in inta kale ay iman doonto.
Let me be with you a bit.	Aan kula yara noqdo.
Pick me up	I soo qaado
As long as you are smarter.	Inta aad ka caqli badan tahay.
He always came back.	Mar walba wuu soo noqon jiray.
I saw that here somewhere.	Waxaan taas ku arkay halkan meel.
The school was like that.	Dugsiga sidaas bay ahayd.
There is not enough money.	Lacag ku filan ma jirto.
No, but it is there.	Ma jiro, laakiin waa halkaas.
You know you want it.	Waad ogtahay inaad rabto.
Doing anything.	Wax ka samaynta waxba.
Too much and too much.	Aad u badan oo badan.
If you do.	Haddii aad sameyso.
Don't do that.	Ha samayn taas.
I wanted to eat.	Waxaan rabay inaan cuno.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I knew this could happen.	Waan ogaa inay tani dhici karto.
We are a person.	Waxaan nahay qof.
But that is me.	Laakiin taasi waa aniga.
If you like us, great.	Haddii aad na jeceshahay, weyn.
He quickly looked back.	Degdeg ayuu dib u eegay.
It may have something to do with this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay arrintan wax ku leedahay.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
We can't stay.	Ma joogi karno.
I know she did.	Waan ogahay inay samaysay.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
Maybe not a little fun.	Ma laga yaabaa in ay xiiso yar.
One, not many.	Mid, ma badna.
He was with a friend.	Waxa uu la joogay saaxiib.
He said he would not get enough time.	Waxa uu sheegay in uusan waqti ku filan heli doonin.
He had this.	Waxa uu lahaa tan.
He really did everything he could.	Runtii wuu sameeyay wax walba oo uu awoodo.
how are you.	sidee tahay.
Please do not come to me.	Fadlan ha ii iman.
Not sure elsewhere.	Ma hubo meel kale.
That's not what.	Taasi maaha waxa.
He will come as one.	Wuxuu u iman doonaa sida mid.
I did not succeed	Maan guulaysan
I really liked him.	Aad iyo aad baan uga helay isaga.
That, too, was new.	Taasi, sidoo kale, waxay ahayd mid cusub.
I really had no idea.	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama helin.
In fact, there is a lot going on.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa jira wax badan oo socda.
I think that is enough for us.	Waxay ila tahay in nagu filan.
Can you help?	Ma caawin kartaa ?.
That is often true.	Taasi waa run inta badan.
He stayed.	Wuu iska joogay.
Quick	Degdeg ah
Most have disappeared.	Inta badan waa la waayay.
We are friends, too.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo, sidoo kale.
Maybe that would be better.	Malaha taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I bought a car.	Waxaan iibsaday baabuur.
It's not that you can't.	Ma aha inaadan awoodin.
Something got lucky.	Wax lagu helay nasiib.
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
I know you will.	Waan ogahay inaad yeeli doonto.
Lots of them.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah.
I know what it looks like.	Waan ogahay sida ay u egtahay.
As you are.	Sida aad tahay.
I really wanted to.	Runtii waan rabay.
Very close and very beautiful.	Aad u dhow oo aad u qurux badan.
I'm happy	waan ku faraxsanahay
I have never seen him so happy.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo aad u faraxsan.
now I know you.	hadda waan ku garanayaa.
Now she had friends.	Hadda waxay lahayd saaxiibo.
You are right.	Wax sax ah ayaad sheegtay.
And, maybe that's right.	Oo, malaha waa sax.
He seemed to know what to do.	Waxa uu u muuqday in uu garanayo waxa uu sameeyo.
I don't think anyone can.	Uma maleynayo in qofna uusan awoodin.
That may not be a smart idea.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi aysan ahayn fikrad caqli badan.
It is before.	Waa ka hor.
I hope you will be fine.	Waxaan filayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto.
Now he saw it.	Hadda wuu arkay.
It was really a beautiful little place.	Runtii waxay ahayd meel yar oo qurux badan.
I am not like everyone else.	Ma ihi sida dadka kale.
It will take a lot of work.	Waxay qaadan doontaa shaqo badan.
No wonder but it is enough.	La yaab ma leh laakiin waa ku filan tahay.
Each of us was.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah ayaa ahaa.
Before and after a man did not like.	Hore iyo ka dib nin ma jeclayn.
I did not see him coming.	Maan arag isaga oo soo socda.
There is no real luck there either.	Ma jiro nasiib dhab ah halkaas sidoo kale.
It was strange, unbelievable to him.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh, oo aan la rumaysan karin isaga.
I hope we will be friends.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqon doono saaxiibo.
I am happy here	Waan ku faraxsanahay halkan
I think it is true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay.
But this is not as bad as it sounds.	Laakiin tani maaha mid xun sida ay u egtahay.
Really bad stuff.	Runtii waxyaabo xun.
He found time.	Waqti buu helay.
I am very, very sorry.	Aad baan ahay, aad baan uga xumahay.
Much more than tomorrow.	Wax badan oo ka badan kan berrito.
That is a thing, he thinks.	Taasi waa wax, ayuu qabaa.
I hope you will be here.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad halkaan joogi doonto.
Like even more food.	Sida xitaa cunto badan.
I can't stay here.	Halkan kuma joogi karo.
No one does better.	Qofna si ka fiican uma sameeyo.
Every man can see that.	Nin walba wuu arki karaa taas.
It was not a good thing	Ma ahayn wax fiican
In fact, too much.	Dhab ahaantii, aad u badan.
That was a lie.	Taasi waxay ahayd been.
I just have no idea.	Kaliya wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
That, even more so.	Taas, xitaa ka sii badan.
I really like this.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay tan.
How you do it.	Sida aad samaynayso.
I will say friend.	Waxaan odhan doonaa saaxiib.
There is no one like him.	Qof la mid ah ma jiro.
It is the same here, everyone and everyone.	Waa isla halkan, qof kasta iyo qof kasta.
That would really be great.	Taasi runtii aad bay u fiicnaan lahayd.
But no one was there.	Laakiin qofna ma jirin.
I told him to leave me.	Waxaan u sheegay inuu iga tago.
You can do anything.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
Don't do this again.	Mar dambe tan ha samayn.
She was not yet ready to go home.	Wali diyaar uma ahayn inay guriga aado.
It's actually harder than that.	Dhab ahaantii way ka adag tahay taas.
But he did not want to.	Laakiin ma uu rabin.
Were you.	Ma waxaad ahayd.
She had an idea.	Waxay lahayd fikrad.
I love work	Waxaan jeclahay shaqada
You were a real friend.	Waxaad ahayd saaxiib dhab ah.
More often than not.	Si ka sii badan had iyo jeer.
That has something to do with it.	Taasi wax bay leedahay.
There was not enough	Ma jirin wax ku filan
What did you say.	Maxaad tidhi.
I did not do that well.	Taas si fiican uma aanan samayn.
What more?	Maxaa ka sii badan?
How really, can it be seen otherwise.	Sidee runtii, loo arki karaa si kale.
I know we will be together.	Waxaan ogahay inaan wada joogi doono.
There wasn’t much opportunity, either.	Ma jirin fursad badan, iyo sidoo kale.
There is something great in it.	Wax weyn baa ku jira.
I made it to work here.	Waxaan u sameeyay inaan halkan ka shaqeeyo.
He knew what he was doing.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu samaynayo.
There is no other.	Mid kale ma jiro.
She didn't get enough of it.	Waxay ka heli wayday wax ku filan.
Most of what he did was nothing.	Inta badan waxa uu sameeyay waxba ma ahayn.
You need more than anyone.	Waxaad u baahan tahay in ka badan qof kasta.
Otherwise he left.	Haddii kale wuu baxay.
What did he do?	Muxuu sameeyay.
He did the same with the other.	Mid la mid ah ayuu ku sameeyay kii kale.
But this must be done.	Laakiin tani waa in la sameeyaa.
I do it again.	Mar kale ayaan sameeyaa.
Something was going to happen.	Wax baa dhici lahaa.
One really great.	Mid runtii aad u weyn.
For you, that is.	Adiga, taasi waa.
That was interesting, too.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh, sidoo kale.
I have no idea how to do it.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida aad u sameyso.
Do not let it.	Ha u ogolaan.
But it can be.	Laakiin way noqon kartaa.
There was nothing new about this.	Ma jirin wax ku cusub arrintan.
I would like to know.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado.
I have tried this several times.	Dhowr jeer ayaan isku dayay tan.
He could not leave.	Waa uu bixi waayay.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay lahayn.
That wasn’t too bad.	Taasi ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
He would do one.	Mid buu u samayn lahaa.
She looks like him.	Waxay u egtahay isaga.
Always.	Had iyo jeer.
I will stay here	halkaan ayaan joogi doonaa
I do not want to be someone else.	Ma rabo inaan noqdo qof kale.
The same is expected.	Si la mid ah ayaa la filayaa.
Spend more time with him.	Waqti badan la qaado isaga.
That is not a bad thing.	Taasi wax xun maaha.
A few years.	Dhowr sano.
There was nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la sameeyo ma jirin.
Just give me time.	Kaliya i sii waqti.
That is a lot of money.	Taasi waa lacag aad u badan.
He loves you.	Wuu ku jecel yahay.
Do not say.	Ha odhan.
He probably would have done the same.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu samayn lahaa wax la mid ah.
That was a bit difficult.	Taasi waxay ahayd xoogaa adag.
I was a man now.	Waxaan ahaa nin hadda.
You are a true friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib run ah.
I do not know what it is.	Ma garanayo waxa ay tahay.
I wanted to see what it looked like.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko sida aad u egtahay.
I'm leaving now	hadda waan tagi
More than needed.	Si ka badan inta loo baahan yahay.
I didn't want much.	Wax badan ma rabin.
In fact, it can be a lot.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon kartaa wax badan.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
It was unbelievable.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
I can't talk to him.	Ma la hadli karo isaga.
I want to leave something good.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka tago wax wanaagsan.
I am not talking about it here.	Ka hadli maayo halkan.
what are you	maxaad tahay.
Would anyone like to tell me what's going on?	Qof ma jeclaan lahaa inuu ii sheego waxa socda?
I did not.	Maan samayn.
I can always leave.	Mar walba waan bixi karaa.
A well-known problem was unemployment.	Dhibaato la wada ogaa waxay ahayd shaqo la'aan.
Not to be outdone	Aan noqon
I don't want to work anywhere else.	Ma doonayo inaan meel kale ka shaqeeyo.
I still am really.	Weli dhab ahaantii waan ahay.
But he wanted to do only one.	Laakiin wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo hal kaliya.
It was made the day before.	Waxaa la sameeyay maalin ka hor.
She did it for him.	Waxay ku samaysay isaga.
To be seen is to be known, and to be known is to be seen.	In la arko waa in la ogaado, iyo in la ogaado waa in la arko.
How is it done?	Sidee loo sameeyaa?
But for the most part, we can’t get it.	Laakiin inta badan, ma heli karno.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
He did not want to lie.	Ma uu rabin in uu been u sheego.
No one knows for sure who she was.	Qofna si hubaal ah uma garanayo cidda ay ahayd.
He could hardly afford it.	Si dhib ah ayuu u awoodi waayay.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
This is because no one.	Tani waa sababta oo ah ma jiro mid.
It will come out.	Way soo bixi doontaa.
He is at the door, ready to leave.	Albaabka ayuu joogaa, diyaar ayuu u yahay inuu baxo.
They are real friends.	Waa saaxiibo dhab ah.
It certainly looks like.	Waxaa hubaal ah inay u egtahay.
But he was not.	Laakiin ma uusan ahayn.
But that is all today.	Laakiin taasi waa maanta oo dhan.
It's great too.	Way weyn tahay sidoo kale.
It was really beautiful.	Runtii waxay ahayd wax qurux badan.
He must have made a lot of money.	Waa in uu lacag badan soo galay.
I think it will be soon.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhawaan tahay.
Not just everyone.	Kaliya maaha qof walba.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab yaab.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
It will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doono.
How he wants to see me.	Sida uu rabo inuu ii arko.
Do you think it is difficult to buy?	Ma u malaynaysaa inay ku adag tahay in la iibsado?
I was told.	Waa la ii sheegay.
There are other things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I am not	Ma ihi
I had no idea who she was.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn cidda ay tahay.
I would help you	waan ku caawin lahaa
Please take only what you need.	Fadlan qaado waxaad u baahan tahay oo kaliya.
Not small.	Ma yara.
There is no other food.	Cunto kale ma jirto.
In fact, it will not happen.	Dhab ahaantii, ma dhici doonto.
He did not do this.	Tani ma uu samayn.
He had friends there.	Halkaas ayuu saaxiibo ku lahaa.
I got a job.	Waxaan helay shaqo.
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
Now I have tried.	Hadda ayaan isku dayay.
But it is the same everywhere.	Laakiin waa isku mid meel walba.
But this was once he really wanted to know.	Laakiin tani mar uu si dhab ah u rabay inuu ogaado.
He could see nothing.	Waxba wuu arki waayay.
You are so amazing.	Aad baad u yaab badan tahay.
If that is true, great.	Haddii taasi run tahay, weyn.
He will probably get the job.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu heli doono shaqada.
I don't know what's in there.	Ma garanayo waxa meesha ku jira.
I have no idea how to do it.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida uu u sameeyo.
I wonder if it is true.	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay run tahay.
But it was done.	Laakiin waa la sameeyay.
I wanted to say.	Waxaan rabay inaan sheego.
He once came out with us.	Mar buu nala soo baxay.
I can see everything.	Wax walba waan arki karaa.
I have no idea she refused.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay diiday.
I did not believe him.	Maan rumaysan isaga.
I need a lot of money	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag badan
He did not like it.	Ma uu jeclayn.
There was no other man.	Nin kale ma jirin.
I will be fine with you.	Waan ku fiicnaan doonaa.
He may leave.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu baxo.
There were so many other things reported.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo aad u badan oo la soo sheegay.
She did not believe.	Ma ay rumaysan.
He can do anything.	Wax kasta wuu samayn karaa.
You can see it as clear as anything.	Waxaad u arki kartaa cad sida wax kasta.
This is interesting.	Tani waa mid xiiso leh.
No one said much.	Qofna wax badan ma odhan.
It is now every day.	Hadda waa maalin kasta.
I am lucky to be here.	Nasiib ayaan leeyahay inaan halkan joogo.
He asked her to help.	Wuxuu ka codsaday inay caawiso.
Nothing stopped.	Waxba ma joojin.
There are things that need to be done.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo u baahan in la sameeyo.
You will give more.	Waxyaabo badan ayaad siin doontaa.
But only one.	Laakiin hal kaliya.
I have never seen this.	Weligay tan ma arag.
It was a good thing he didn't have.	Waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan inuusan haysan.
This is also done.	Tani sidoo kale waa la sameeyaa.
He had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma lahayn.
It included.	Waxaa ka mid ahaa.
I know why.	Waan ogahay sababta.
They still do.	Weli way sameeyaan.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
You can't do that now.	Taas hadda ma aad samayn karin.
A few years ago still.	Dhowr sano ka hor weli.
Just a friend.	Kaliya saaxiib.
I think.	Waxaan qabaa.
There is a lot of time !.	Waqti badan baa jira!.
There is no such thing.	Ma jiro wax isku mid ah.
More than one year is enough.	In ka badan hal sano ayaa ku filan.
We can't do it here	Halkan kuma samayn karno
I know you are a good person.	Waan ogahay inaad tahay qof wanaagsan.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
There was much that they had not yet discussed.	Wax badan oo aanay weli ka wada hadlin baa jiray.
She always had, until recently.	Waxay had iyo jeer lahaa, ilaa dhawaan.
He is ready to work.	Wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu shaqeeyo.
But for a while.	Laakiin in muddo ah.
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
I am in a very bad place	Waxaan joogaa meel aad u xun
I would love to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
She would see what was going on.	Way is arki lahayd waxa jira.
I didn't get that.	Taas maan helin.
Much less.	In badan ayaa ka yar.
Requires some work.	Oo u baahan xoogaa shaqo ah.
You told us what to do.	Waxaad noo sheegtay waxaan samayno.
We are the same.	Waxaan nahay isku mid.
I do not know why he left.	Ma garanayo sababta uu uga tagay.
He did no harm.	Wax dhib ah kuma uu samayn.
He was interesting.	Waxa uu ahaa mid xiiso leh.
But this is a big deal.	Laakiin tani waa wax aad u weyn.
Something is wrong.	Wax aan sax ahayn.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Waan ogaa inuu wax walba iga yaqaan.
You will be fine	Waad fiicnaan doontaa
Much the same.	In badan oo isku mid ah.
That's all.	Waa taas oo dhan.
But other things as well.	Laakiin waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
I would rather be here.	Waxaan ka jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaan joogo.
He knew what he was going to get.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu heli doono.
I know it exists.	Waan ogahay inuu jiro.
They are many things.	Waa waxyaabo badan.
I need time to learn that.	Waxaan u baahanahay waqti aan taas ku barto.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd si dhab ah.
Maybe this will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
It can stay here	Way joogi kartaa halkan
I knew that.	Waan ogaa taas.
I think she needs to do a little bit.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay u baahan tahay inay sameyso wax yar.
I did not understand that.	Taas maan fahmin.
That was rejected.	Taas waa la diiday.
That has to be done.	Taasi waa in la sameeyaa.
He can do anything.	Wax walba wuu samayn karaa.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ma garanayo waxa ku dhacay.
What a wonderful friend.	Maxaa saaxiib la yaab leh.
She has friends.	Waxay leedahay saaxiibo.
I have something to tell you.	wax aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa.
It was new, now so big.	Waxay ahayd cusub, hadda oo aad u weyn.
It is there but it is not.	Waa halkaas laakiin maaha.
In fact, he did.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu sameeyay.
There was no problem.	Ma jirin wax dhibaato ah.
It is where he lives.	Waa halka uu ku nool yahay.
Who came from everywhere.	Yaa meel walba ka yimid.
That is what I will do.	Taasi waa waxa aan sameyn doono.
Maybe someone left food.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof ka tagay cunto.
No one cares.	Qofna waxba kama qabo.
I can always get it	Mar kasta waan heli karaa
But he wanted to talk about it.	Laakiin wuxuu rabay inuu ka hadlo.
it will not happen.	ma dhici doonto .
I want to be here and now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan iyo hadda joogo.
I don't want to talk to anyone right now.	Ma rabin inaan qof la hadlo hadda.
This is not a lie.	Tani been ma aha.
It goes a little farther.	Wax yar baa meel dheer u socda.
Everything he did was like that.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyay ayaa ahaa sidaas.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn kartid.
It was until now what everyone else was doing.	Waxay ahayd ilaa hadda ka hor waxa qof kasta oo kale samaynayo.
Not a big deal.	Maaha wax weyn.
Many things are going on.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa la socda.
It can take time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
You can do the same here.	Waxaad ku samayn kartaa wax la mid ah halkan.
Unless otherwise noted.	Haddii aan si kale loo sheegin,.
Hold on if it can be done.	Qabo haddii la qaban karo.
That, and that, as well.	Taasi, iyo taas, iyo sidoo kale.
No one knew anything.	Qofna waxba ma ogayn.
I didn’t want to do this.	Ma aanan rabin inaan tan sameeyo.
I became right.	Waxaan noqday sax.
I still can't leave here.	Halkan wali kama bixi karo.
No one was seen.	Cidna lama arag.
It had to work.	Waxay ahayd inuu u shaqeeyo.
That is what he would expect.	Taasi waa waxa uu filan lahaa.
He refused to talk to her.	Wuu diiday inuu la hadlo.
She did well.	Waxay samaysay si fiican.
Not if we can help.	Ma aha haddii aan ku caawin karno.
We can do nothing with him here.	Waxba kuma samayn karno isaga halkan.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
And he gets it.	Oo uu helo wuxuu u yimid.
I came in.	waan soo galay.
And a lot of them.	Iyo wax badan oo ka mid ah.
I did not receive it	maan helin
It is a real beauty.	Waa qurux dhab ah.
I am not the same.	Anigu isku mid ma ihi.
He tells us.	Wuxuu nagu leeyahay.
Worst of all, too.	Waxa ugu xun, sidoo kale.
I will not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegi doono.
But he never got it.	Laakiin waligiis ma helin.
Until much later that is it.	Ilaa wax badan ka dib waa taas.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
He would come.	Wuu iman lahaa.
I could not see the rest.	Inta kale maan arki karin.
Something is going on in this.	Wax baa ku socda arrintan.
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta ay taasi tahay.
Another interesting one.	Mid kale oo xiiso leh.
They do it right there.	Waxay ku sameeyaan isla halkaas.
The same.	Taas la mid ah.
There is no way to get it all.	Ma jirto si loo helo dhammaan.
I don't understand what she means to me.	Ma fahmin waxa ay aniga ila tahay.
Take time.	Waqti la qaado.
Can you see a friend here?	Ma ku arki kartaa saaxiib halkan?
It was a bad thing to see.	Waxay ahayd wax xun in la arko.
That can be a problem.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
Although it is better!	In kasta oo ay ka sii wanaagsan tahay!
For one thing, this is true.	Hal si, tani waa run.
Didn't they do a good job?	Miyaanay shaqo fiican qaban?
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
I became.	waxaan noqday.
Maybe you are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tahay.
Not much.	Wax badan ma aha.
A few years at home.	Dhowr sano oo guriga ah.
I want him to come here.	Waxaan rabaa inuu halkan yimaado.
Not sure how to do this.	Ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
You told me that.	Waad ii sheegtay taas.
He is a good man, a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan, nin fiican.
And he had.	Oo uu lahaa.
I think this is mostly true.	Waxaan filayaa in tani inta badan run tahay.
He was not and will never be.	Ma uusan ahayn oo waligiis ma ahaan doono.
Really well done.	Runtii si wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
Everyone says the same thing.	Qof walba sidaas oo kale ayuu leeyahay.
But he is happy.	Laakiin wuu faraxsan yahay.
There were things he wanted to know.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo uu rabay inuu ogaado.
You told him.	Waxaad u sheegtay.
I knew it would happen.	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto.
It is the same.	Waa isku mid.
Everyone looked.	Qof kastaa wuu eegay.
There was another older man.	Waxaa jiray nin kale oo ka weyn.
All here should not talk about it.	Dhammaan halkan waa inaysan ka hadlin.
To do what he wants to do.	In uu sameeyo waxa uu rabo in uu sameeyo.
But that was a problem the other day.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd dhibaato maalin kale.
It can not be real.	Ma uu noqon karo dhab.
I just want you	Kaliya waan ku rabaa
It is still small.	Weli wuu yar yahay.
More than one person.	In ka badan hal qof.
Really, let me help you.	Runtii, aan ku caawiyo.
There was everything to say, and nothing.	Waxaa jiray wax kasta oo la sheego, iyo waxba.
I still can't believe it.	Wali ma rumaysan karo.
I probably would have paid more.	Waxaan u badan tahay inaan bixin lahaa wax badan.
It's me he wants.	Waa aniga uu rabo.
I do not know how they do it.	Ma garanayo sida ay u sameeyaan.
Don't tell others yet.	Weli dadka kale ha u sheegin.
i love you so much.	waan ku jeclahay sidaas.
It's a little smaller.	Way ka yara yar tahay.
But it was very interesting.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
What happened, happened.	Maxaa dhacay, dhacay.
it would happen.	wuu dhici lahaa.
On his way.	Isaga oo u socda.
He was very clear.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u cad.
I have not had any problems so far.	Wax dhibaato ah ma helin ilaa hadda.
It is very common for one person.	Aad bay ugu badan tahay hal qof.
I just have to stay here.	Kaliya waa inaan halkaan joogo.
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
But there was nothing she could do about it.	Laakiin ma jirin wax ay ka qaban karto.
I really had.	Runtii waan lahaa.
I hope they are well and happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay wanaagsan yihiin oo faraxsan yihiin.
I had no idea how to learn.	Wax fikrad ah uma haysan sida wax loo barto.
I am the same.	Waxaan ahay isku mid.
I used to do that.	Taas ayaan samayn jiray.
I wanted to find out the truth with you.	Waxaan rabay inaan run kula helo.
Well done.	Si wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
I want to know what is going on here.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa halkan ka socda.
She did not say.	Ma aysan odhan.
I heard it was good.	Waxaan maqlay inay wanaagsan tahay.
Still, it's good.	Weli, way wanaagsan tahay.
I am still there	wali waan joogaa
I want to know why.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta.
I did not like it.	Maan jeclayn.
But there is no urgency, take time.	Laakiin ma jiro wax degdeg ah, waqti qaado.
Now he had one.	Hadda mid buu lahaa.
Obviously, they didn’t have time.	Sida iska cad, ma aysan haysan waqti.
Not too small.	Aad uma yara.
As much as you are likely to do.	Sida aad u badan tahay inaad sameyso.
We can't have that.	Taas ma haysan karno.
If they like it, great.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin, weyn.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Someone has to.	Qof waa inuu.
This should not be allowed.	Tani waa in aan la ogolaan.
No one yet.	Wali qofna ma jiro.
No one comes to the door.	Qofna ma yimaado albaabka.
But he knew she did.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inay samaysay.
I saw.	waan arkay.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ma jiro wax xun oo aan ka sheego.
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
Sure, it was permanent.	Hubaal, waxay ahayd mid joogto ah.
.	.
He almost came to see her.	Wakhti ku dhow ayuu yimid si uu u arko.
You are more than a man.	Nin baad ka badan tahay.
But I see.	Laakiin aan arko.
he was ready.	diyaar buu ahaa.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
Once upon a time there was a chance.	Mar waa nasiib.
This should not surprise anyone.	Tani waa inaysan cidna la yaab ku noqon.
There was no surprise.	Wax la yaab leh ma jirin.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Laakiin malaha taasi waa wax fiican.
You will stay here	Halkan ayaad joogi doontaa
That's right, everything.	Taasi waa sax, wax walba.
It still is, really.	Weli waa, dhab ahaantii.
That is for everyone.	Taasi waa qof walba.
This is a beautiful place.	Tani waa meel qurux badan.
I will tell them who we are.	Waxaan u sheegi doonaa waxaan nahay.
I could not see who she was, but someone was there.	Ma aan arki karin cidda ay tahay, laakiin qof ayaa joogay.
That was, no more.	Taasi waxay ahayd, mar dambe ma jirto.
It is clearly a lie.	Si cad waa been.
So he looked at me.	Sidaas ayuu ii eegay.
Any help would be very helpful.	Caawin kasta aad bay u caawin lahayd.
I would really like that.	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa taas.
We were good friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo wanaagsan.
You may not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan ahayn.
There was no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jirin.
That’s what made it so much fun.	Taasi waa waxa ka dhigay mid aad u xiiso badan.
But very happy, too.	Laakiin aad u faraxsan, sidoo kale.
I gave you what you wanted.	Waxaan ku siiyay waxaad rabto.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
I will say more.	wax badan ayaan odhan doonaa.
This was a terrible thing.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
This is also a problem.	Tani sidoo kale waa dhibaato.
He used to do something for me.	Wax buu ii samayn jiray.
This is really true.	Runtii tani waa run.
There may be something bigger than work.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax ka weyn shaqada.
It was a long and difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer oo dhib badan.
It is a small meal.	Waa cunto yar.
Everyone is happy.	Qof walba wuu faraxsan yahay.
He said it was a good thing.	Wuxuu yidhi, waa wax fiican.
There are things that can be done to help.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo la samayn karo si lagu caawiyo.
Me, but you know, it really isn’t.	Aniga, laakiin waad ogtahay, run ahaantii maaha.
It was to be seen coming.	Waxay ahayd in la arko soo socda.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
I don't know who did it.	Ma garanayo cidda samaysay.
This is not just an idea, this is real.	Tani maaha kaliya fikrad, tani waa dhab.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
It will be there until tonight	Waxa ay ahaan doontaa halkaas ilaa caawa
There is no lie here.	Halkan been ma jirto.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Waa markii aad bixi lahayd hadda.
Maybe I know that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan taas ku ogaado.
I just don't know how to do it.	Kaliya ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo.
I do not lie.	Been ma sheego.
There was something wrong with it.	Wax baa ka jiray.
And nothing was the same anymore.	Oo waxba mar dambe isku mid ma ahayn.
Not him.	Aan isaga ahayn.
To find out more.	Si aad wax badan u ogaato.
He did it as if it were nothing to him.	Waxa uu u sameeyay sidii aanay isaga waxba u ahayn.
They really do.	Runtii way sameeyaan.
Everything you said is true.	Wax kasta oo aad sheegtay waa run.
You can see it here, here, and here.	Waxaad arki kartaa halkan, halkan, iyo halkan.
As before.	Si ka hore.
It 's better to get back to work.	Waxa fiican in aan shaqada ku soo noqdo.
She would do it today, really.	Way samayn lahayd maanta, runtii.
You have lost a man.	Nin ayaad weyday.
With a friend.	La saaxiib.
Lots of this.	Wax badan oo tan ah.
But it was something else.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax kale.
And, what else.	Iyo, maxaa kale.
We need to work on it.	Waxaan u baahanahay in laga shaqeeyo.
It's time.	Waa muddo.
We were once friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo mar.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
There is no place for you here.	Ma jirto meel aad halkan.
Here at home.	Halkan guriga.
I'm sure I.	Waxaan hubaa in aan.
It is not visible to anyone.	Ma aha mid qofna arki karo.
He got it for three years.	Saddex sano ayuu u helay.
It looks beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay qurux.
Constantly.	Si joogto ah.
Probably everyone who was with him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof kasta oo isaga la jiray.
More than enough.	In ka badan oo ku filan.
That is the only reason it is done.	Taasi waa sababta kaliya ee loo sameeyo.
That is so.	Taasi waa sidaas.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
Go home.	Guriga aad.
I did not take any money.	Wax lacag ah maan qaadan.
I didn’t know that.	Maan ogayn taas.
Nice to see you.	Aad bay u fiican tahay inaan ku arko.
Sorry to leave you with this.	Waan ka xumahay inaan kaa tago tan.
He is not here today.	Maanta ma joogo.
You haven't seen anything yet.	Weli waxba ma aadan arag.
Today, they do not.	Maanta, ma sameeyaan.
So much, really.	Wax aad u badan, runtii.
I found this interesting.	Tan waxaan ka helay mid xiiso leh.
I don't get this.	Anigu ma helo tan.
he is good.	wuu fiican yahay.
I don't think he will.	Uma maleynayo inuu sameyn doono.
I can see you.	Waan ku arki karaa adiga.
Everyone usually knows this.	Qof walba inta badan wuu garanayaa tan.
I really don't know anyone.	Runtii qofna ma garanayo.
This is obviously difficult.	Tani sida cad waa mid adag.
Not surprisingly.	Ma aha wax la yaab leh.
I need to know.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado.
I do not know how he got it so quickly.	Ma garanayo sida uu degdeg ugu helay.
So far they have not received it.	Ilaa hadda ma aysan helin.
I need more than ever.	Waxaan u baahanahay in ka badan sidii hore.
He says it is true.	Waxa uu yidhi waa run.
He wanted to be with her.	Wuxuu rabay inuu la joogo.
No one understood what had happened.	Qofna ma fahmin wax dhacay.
I would not say that correctly.	Si sax ah uma odhan lahaa taas.
If they really love you they will come back.	Haddii ay si dhab ah kuu jecel yihiin way soo noqon doonaan.
It would be hard work.	Waxay noqon lahayd shaqo adag.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi sidaas maaha.
Someone to pick up who you are.	Qof si aad u qaado kii aad ahayd.
This is a beautiful place.	Tani waa meel aad u qurux badan.
He finds it difficult to leave.	Wuu ku adag yahay inuu baxo.
Otherwise it is the same.	Haddii kale waa isku mid.
This is good and consistent.	Tani waa si fiican oo joogto ah.
There is no time.	Ma jiraan wax waqti ah.
This is not one.	Tani maaha mid.
But I didn't think he would.	Laakiin uma malaynayn inuu yeeli doono.
And would tell me.	Oo ii sheegi lahaa.
I really shouldn't have.	Runtii ma ahayn inaan.
He knew very well why.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa sababta.
But you did not.	Laakiin ma aad samayn.
But it could be otherwise.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa si kale.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
Not what it looks like.	Ma aha sida ay u egtahay.
This is how it looks.	Tani waa sida ay taasi u egtahay.
I think she can do whatever she wants.	Waxaan filayaa inay samayn karto waxay doonto.
I need a lot of money	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag badan
I thought you know.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ogaato.
I could not take it	Waan qaadan waayay
I put everything here.	Wax walba ayaan halkan dhigay.
I can't tell anyone.	Qofna uma sheegi karo.
Over today for a while now.	In ka badan maanta in muddo ah hadda.
I wanted to do something great	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax weyn
I hope you can see that.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad taas arki karto.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
How are you.	Sidee tahay.
It was too long.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Lama hubo cidda samaysay.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
He is really a friend !.	Runtii waa saaxiib!.
It's right there	Waa isla halkaas
He may not know him.	Ma laga yaabaa inuu ogaado isaga.
Only you.	Adiga kaliya.
I really like him.	Runtii aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
It is a beautiful car.	Waa baabuur qurux badan.
Also I’m not sure they will help much.	Sidoo kale ma hubo inay wax badan caawin doonaan.
I felt so bad.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u xun.
He really couldn't.	Runtii wuu awoodi waayay.
I need to work on that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo taas.
Would you need it	Ma u baahan lahayd
While you are in it.	Adiga oo ku jira.
She did not think so.	Waxay u malayn wayday.
I will tell you now.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa hadda.
Please more, more.	Fadlan wax badan, ka badan.
I love you here	Waan ku jeclahay halkan
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
Nice to see you.	Aad bay u fiican tahay inaan ku arko.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
I wanted to do something that would not do that.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax aan taas samayn doonin.
Let's do that.	Aan samayno taas.
And how much.	Iyo inta.
Something similar indeed.	Wax la mid ah runtii.
There is a lot of surprise.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la yaabay.
You can do it at home.	Waxaad ka samayn kartaa guriga.
I really didn't like this one.	Runtii maan jeclayn kan.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
They are very good at it.	Aad bay ugu fiican yihiin.
I tried to see things differently.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan si kale wax u arko.
You are too much.	Aad baad u badan tahay.
Not just first.	Kaliya maaha marka hore.
He said little and nothing.	Wax yar ayuu yidhi waxba.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
But simply.	Laakiin si dhib yar.
I can't even be a real person.	Xitaa ma noqon karo qof dhab ah.
That can't happen!	Taasi ma dhici karto!
He told me he did not know.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aanu garanayn.
I knew you would spend time with her.	Waan ogaa inaad waqti la qaadan doonto.
I should have seen it earlier.	Waxay ahayd inaan hore u arko.
He wondered why.	Waxa uu la yaabay sababta.
big and small.	weyn iyo mid yar.
But I do not do that.	Laakiin taas ma sameeyo.
I would do the same for you	sidaas oo kale ayaan kuu samayn lahaa
No one is sure what is coming.	Qofna ma hubo waxa soo socda.
No one should really be surprised.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu runtii la yaabo.
There were no problems.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jirin.
I don't want to know anything.	Ma rabo inaan wax ogaado.
Stop what you are doing now.	Jooji waxa aad samaynayso hadda.
I can hardly believe it.	Si dhib ah uma rumaysan karo.
You look so ugly!	Waxaad u egtahay mid aad u xun!
I told him I loved him.	Waxaan u sheegay in aan jeclahay isaga.
It's as bad as it could be.	Way u xun tahay sida ay noqon karto.
I know this is true.	Waan ogahay in tani ay sax tahay.
Had at home.	Guriga ku lahaa.
Today, it has only one.	Maanta, waxay leedahay hal kaliya.
There is no such time now.	Ma jiro waqti la mid ah hadda.
And it would not last long.	Oo ma uu haysan lahaa muddo dheer.
he will see you	wuu ku arki doonaa
Let me do this here.	Aan ku samayn tan halkan.
I am an adult	Waxaan ahay qof weyn
I never had that.	Weligay taas maan haysan.
you are a great man.	nin weyn baad tahay.
Only one came out.	Mid kaliya ayaa soo baxay.
Even if you don’t, someone else will.	Xitaa haddii aadan samayn, qof kale ayaa sameyn doona.
I like what is said.	Waan jeclahay waxa lagu sheegay.
It's just right.	Waxa kaliya oo sax ah.
I know they are many.	Waan ogahay inay badan yihiin.
Don't do that.	Taas ha u qaban.
You can leave at any time.	Waad iska bixi kartaa wakhti kasta.
It was not good.	Wax fiican ma ahayn.
I think it was true too.	Waxaan filayaa inuu sidoo kale run ahaa.
I thought that was awful.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay ahayd mid aad u xun.
He was never lucky.	Waligiis nasiib uma helin.
That was done.	Taas la sameeyay.
That’s how much you need to know.	Taasi waa inta aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
But it does not look good today.	Laakiin maanta si fiican uma eka.
I really don't get it.	Runtii ma helo.
That would come back, he thought.	Taasi way soo noqon lahayd, ayuu is yidhi.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
We can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karno.
Now you are like everyone else.	Hadda waxaad tahay sida dadka kale.
He was one of us.	Wuxuu ahaa mid naga mid ah.
I want him.	waan rabaa isaga.
But this is not the case	Laakiin tani maaha
But he left.	Laakiin wuu baxay.
Always, he said.	Had iyo jeer, ayuu yidhi.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
He is gone, you can no longer help.	Wuu tagay, mar dambe ma caawin kartid.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale ma jirin.
He did not do well.	Si fiican uma uu qaban.
Not too small.	Ma yara yara.
Here and now I say this.	Halkan iyo hadda ayaan tan ku leeyahay.
Maybe I should do so now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hadda sidaas samaynayo.
There was no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn.
I want this to be done.	Waxaan rabaa in tan lagu sameeyo.
That is true.	Taasi waa runtii.
After a while, it will not come to me.	Waqti ka dib, ma ii iman doontaa.
Maybe more than a few.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan dhowr.
If you are in that.	Haddii aad taas ku jirto.
It can be anything.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
I know that's the thing.	Waan ogahay inay taasi wax tahay.
That was the reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta.
There is so much to love here!	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo la jecel yahay halkan!
I just.	Waxaan kaliya.
But there was no time.	Laakiin waqti ma jirin.
A lot is clear to me.	In badan ayaa ii cad.
It wasn’t too much.	Ma ahayn mid aad u badan.
Now is a good time like any other.	Hadda waa wakhti fiican sida mid kasta.
I think it was true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run ahayd.
I am afraid of him.	Isaga waan ka baqayaa.
Something would have helped for a while, until that didn't happen.	Wax ayaa ku caawin lahaa in muddo ah, ilaa ay taasi dhici weyday.
But it is difficult.	Laakiin way adag tahay.
Not true.	Run maaha.
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
You need to be very serious about this.	Waxa aad u baahan tahay in aad arrintan aad u adag tahay.
I still don't have it.	Wali ma hayo.
It did not help.	Ma uusan caawin.
I had one real friend.	Waxaan lahaa hal saaxiib oo dhab ah.
I never got it again.	Mar dambe ma helin.
But obviously it is more difficult.	Laakiin sida cad way ka sii adag tahay.
I can't do that.	Ma awoodo inaan taas sameeyo.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
But no one wanted to go.	Laakiin qofna ma doonayn inuu tago.
Do not speak.	Ha hadlin.
They still exist.	Wali waa ay jiraan.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
I have everything here.	Wax walba halkan ayaan ku hayaa.
I do not understand	ma fahmin
Today is a great day.	Maanta waa maalin weyn.
He asked me to keep it.	Wuxuu iga codsaday inaan sii hayo.
You do not need to be here.	Uma baahnid inaad halkan joogto.
I do not like it a bit.	Anigu ma jecli xoogaa.
I really do not know.	Dhab ahaantii ma garanayo in aan.
This is, really, what happened.	Tani waa, runtii, waxa dhacay.
I love it there	Waan jeclahay halkaas
Maybe something happened.	Malaha wax iska dhacay.
He decided to study.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu wax barto.
I also got back to work.	Waxaan sidoo kale ku soo noqday shaqada.
He felt so much at home.	Wuxuu aad iyo aad uga dareemay guriga.
He came back.	Dib ayuu ugu soo noqday.
It was very smart for him.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u caqli badan isaga.
It is what you want.	Waa waxa aad rabto.
tell me this is not true	ii sheeg tani run maaha
It will be a huge problem.	Waxay noqon doontaa dhibaato aad u weyn.
Not much, but a bit.	Ma badna, laakiin xoogaa.
But they were not with him.	Laakiin way la joogin isaga.
If this is desired you are required, great.	Haddii tani la rabo adiga ayaa la rabaa, weyn.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
In fact, that is the only thing.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa waxa kaliya.
It will be small.	Wax yar bay ahaan doontaa.
He came back.	Waa uu ku soo noqday.
But he did nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma uu qaban.
How can this happen?	Sidee tani ku dhici kartaa.
It was real.	Dhab bay ahayd.
I just need to talk to you.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo.
Maybe nothing.	Malaha waxba ma jiraan.
I had to do very difficult things.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo waxyaabo aad u adag.
Will it help?	Ma caawin doontaa?.
I did not see the next one.	Maan arag soo socda.
Do not say bad things!	Wax xun ha odhan!
But now.	Laakiin hadda.
I tried to find out what happened.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado waxa dhacay.
They will be soon.	Waxay dhawaan noqon doonaan.
It always is.	Had iyo jeer waa.
It was enough money to buy a new car.	Waxay ahayd lacag ku filan oo lagu iibsado baabuur cusub.
I was no longer able to find it.	Mar dambe ma awoodin inaan helo.
It would come back to that.	Way ku soo noqon lahayd taas.
I think it is something else.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax kale.
I know nothing more than you, and maybe less.	Ma garanayo wax ka badan adiga, iyo malaha wax ka yar.
And maybe there, we will get another chance.	Oo malaha halkaas, waxaan heli doonaa fursad kale.
You will stay here	Waxaad sii joogi doontaa halkan
There is really something for everyone.	Runtii qof walba wax baa u jira.
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid iska cad.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ma garanayo waxa ku dhacay.
He was a great man.	Nin weyn buu ahaa.
No one spoke much.	Qofna aad uma uu hadlin.
What would you do?	Maxay ku samayn lahayd?.
I know it's hard.	Waan ogahay inay adag tahay.
He was.	Wuxuu ahaa.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
I do not have time.	Waqti ma hayo.
Which is nice, but not surprising.	Taas oo wanaagsan, laakiin aan la yaab lahayn.
No one can do that.	Qofna taas ma samayn karo.
That's right	Waa sax
You told us.	Waad noo sheegtay.
I know he has one.	Waan ogahay inuu mid leeyahay.
No one else was there, just.	Qof kale ma joogin, kaliya.
Little is known about it.	Wax yar baa laga ogyahay.
I had.	Waxaan lahaa.
Good thing here.	Wax fiican halkan.
But that is.	Laakiin taasi waa.
But no one is there.	Laakiin qofna halkaas ma jiro.
I'm the only one here.	Waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee halkan.
That's a bit too much.	Taasi waa xoogaa badan.
You can come back	Waad soo noqon kartaa
I can't say what.	Ma sheegi karo waxa.
I would really like.	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa.
If nothing is done, we will not get enough food.	Haddii aan waxba la samayn, ma heli doono cunto nagu filan.
That will take you so far.	Taasi waxay ku qaadan doontaa ilaa hadda.
I would love it to work for me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu ii shaqeeyo.
And me.	Iyo aniga.
He went back to the door.	Albaabka ayuu ku noqday.
Which, of course, was.	Taas oo, si, ay ahayd.
I have never seen anything like it.	Wax la mid ah ma arag.
He will see that.	Wuu arki doonaa taas.
A lot has come out of it.	Wax badan baa ka soo baxay.
But it is very good.	Laakiin aad bay u fiican tahay.
In the same way.	Si la mid ah.
Maybe they will be right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax noqon doonaan.
Do not let anyone else speak for you.	Ha u ogolaan qof kale inuu kuu hadlo.
I can't say if this is the case.	Ma sheegi karo inay tani sidaas tahay iyo in kale.
I bought it.	waan iibsaday.
I can't do that	Taas ma samayn karo
He may not like that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan jeclayn taas.
We are, really.	Waxaan nahay, runtii.
I am in it again.	Mar kale ayaan ku jiraa.
He wanted to work harder.	Waxa uu rabay in uu wax badan ka shaqeeyo.
I really want you	aad baan kuu rabaa
I can take him.	waan qaadan karaa isaga.
I hope you do too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale.
The former is a man.	Ka hore waa nin.
It happened to me a long time ago.	Waxa igu dhacay wakhti dheer ka hor.
I will not tell you again.	Mar dambe kuu sheegi maayo.
I can't do it anymore.	Mar dambe ma samayn karo.
He took it, like everyone else.	Wuu ku qaatay, sida dadka kale.
That's fine.	Taasi waa fiican tahay.
But otherwise it was very similar.	Laakiin haddii kale aad buu isku mid ahaa.
Pay.	Bixi.
A lot is going on.	Wax badan ayaa socda.
There was very little.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u yar.
That is what happened to me.	Taasi waa waxa igu dhacay.
There are no guarantees.	Ma jiraan waxyaabo la hubo.
But first another one.	Laakiin marka hore mid kale.
What would that be.	Maxay taasi noqon lahayd.
There is just no way to do it.	Kaliya ma jirto si ay u sameeyaan.
You can't do this anymore.	Tan dambe ma samayn kartid.
Even if it is me.	Xitaa haddii ay aniga tahay.
It's like hard work.	Waxay la mid tahay shaqo adag.
This is bigger than me.	Tani waa iga weyn tahay.
I do not think this is correct.	U malayn maayo in tani sax tahay.
Everyone knows everything.	Qof walba waa ogyahay wax walba.
It was later rejected.	Markii dambe waa la diiday.
A little more.	In yar oo kale.
Better one, too.	Mid ka fiican, sidoo kale.
If it were, she would be back.	Haddii ay ahaan lahayd, way soo noqon doontaa.
In fact, it cannot be.	Dhab ahaantii, ma noqon karto.
You may not like that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan jeclayn taas.
No one should help him.	Qofna waa inuusan caawin isaga.
I can't say enough.	Ku filan ma odhan karo.
He really said.	Runtii wuu yidhi.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
I don't have time for any of them, right now.	Waqti uma hayo mid ka mid ah, hadda.
One has very little with the other.	Mid wax aad u yar ayuu kan kale la leeyahay.
Maybe you can help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ku caawin karto.
I have no problem with this.	Wax dhib ah igama qabo arrintan.
He is who we are.	Waa cidda aan nahay.
He is not a new man.	Nin cusub maaha.
Certainly, there is really nothing else going on.	Waa hubaal, ma jiraan runtii wax kale oo socda.
Every time .	Mar walba .
That must have been difficult.	Taasi waa inay ahayd mid adag.
He could not.	Wuu awoodi waayay.
You will get it.	Waad heli doontaa.
I'm just happy to be with you.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan kula joogo.
He told me he loved me.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu i jecel yahay.
That's right.	Waa sax.
More.	Wax ka badan.
That probably had something to do with it.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay wax ku lahayd.
I did not receive it.	maan helin.
I tried this.	Waxaan isku dayay tan.
I could not let him go.	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu baxo.
He was busy.	Mashquul buu ahaa.
It would not come out.	Ma soo bixi lahayd.
The best.	Waxa ugu wanaagsan.
He came out.	Wuu ka soo baxay.
I did not want to be.	Maan rabin inaan noqdo.
Not everyone, right.	Ma aha qof walba, sax.
I have to say every meal, really.	Waa inaan sheego cunto kasta, run ahaantii.
Food and plenty of food.	Cunto iyo cunto badan.
No one knew about you.	Qofna kaa ma ogayn.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma aha.
I still can't believe it.	Wali ma rumaysan karo.
There was not much.	Wax badan ma jirin.
I did not like you.	kuma jeclayn.
She told me he loved everything.	Waxay ii sheegtay inuu wax walba ka jecel yahay.
He stayed one day.	Hal maalin ayuu iska joogay.
They will be helped.	Waa la caawin doonaa.
There was no one in the room.	Qolka qofna kuma jirin.
You are a man.	Nin baad tahay.
I can't think of anything.	Ma malayn karo waxa.
I want to go out a lot	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan baxo
It was a little beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid yar oo qurux badan.
Nothing was left out.	Ma jirin wax meesha ka baxay.
It's a problem.	Waa dhibaato.
He seemed so loving.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid sidaas jecel.
Tell them the same thing.	U sheeg isla isla wax.
And there is nowhere to go.	Oo meel la aado ma jirto.
Just take it	Kaliya ku qaado
This was a problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhibaato.
Still, it's a good thing to do.	Weli, waa wax fiican in la sameeyo.
Don't come back.	Dib ha u soo noqon.
We can't stay.	Ma joogi karno.
I do not want to see it again.	Ma rabo inaan mar kale arko.
I'm sorry.	waan kaa xumahay.
Like you and me.	Aniga iyo adiga oo kale.
I'm sure you know something about it.	Waan hubaa inaad wax ka ogtahay.
I will not talk about it.	Ka hadli maayo.
I know .	waan garanayaa .
I saw it nearby.	Waxaan arkay meel dhow.
He had to be something.	Wuxuu ahaa inuu wax noqdo.
That is the best so far.	Taasi waa tan ugu fiican ilaa hadda.
It is him.	Waa isaga.
What a beautiful car.	Maxaa baabuur qurux badan.
I thought you wanted to know.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto inaad ogaato.
Just enough for me.	Kaliya igu filan aniga.
There is usually not much there.	Inta badan ma jiraan wax badan halkaas.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I will come to you	waan kuu iman doonaa
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Now she knows that this will not happen.	Hadda waxay ogaatay in tani aysan dhici doonin.
But it was not in any way known.	Laakiin ma jirin si kasta oo la yaqaan.
Just here and there.	Kaliya halkan oo tagay.
No one saw him come.	Qofna ma arag inuu yimid.
I really can't speak right now.	Runtii hadda ma hadli karo.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
She told him.	Waxay u sheegtay.
Maybe a few here and there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in dhowr halkan iyo halkaas.
I would be fine.	Waan ku fiicnaan lahaa.
I knew it existed.	Waan ogaa inay jirto.
See you soon !.	is arag dhawaan!.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha mid adag.
No one really knows.	Qofna runtii ma garanayo.
You will need to be very good.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inay aad u fiican.
You are the one who did it.	Waa adiga kan sidaas sameeyay.
I am very happy to be here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo.
He knew something.	Wax buu ogaa.
But this also cannot be true.	Laakiin tani sidoo kale sax ma noqon karto.
I know this will not happen.	Waan ogahay in tani aysan dhici doonin.
He did everything that was not necessary for him.	Waxa uu sameeyay wax kasta oo aan u baahnayn isaga.
Now.	Hadda.
You can't go back.	Dib uma noqon kartid.
It was a beautiful lie, but a similar lie.	Waxay ahayd been qurux badan, laakiin been la mid ah.
I had to do that for myself.	Waxay ahayd inaan taas ku sameeyo aniga.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
I can't tell anyone.	Qofna uma sheegi karo.
It's gone.	Waa ka baxay.
You will be now.	Hadda waad ahaan doontaa.
It's true.	Waa run.
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
I can say that.	Taas ayaan odhan karaa.
There is no such thing.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah.
But he says.	Laakiin wuu leeyahay.
What's closest.	Maxaa ugu dhow.
It can still happen one day.	Weli way dhici kartaa hal maalin.
I gave everything.	Wax walba waan siiyay.
You can stay there as long as you want.	Halkaas ayaad joogi kartaa inta aad rabto.
But this is nothing new.	Laakiin tani maaha wax cusub.
This is a problem.	Tani waa dhibaato.
I would like more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax badan
I began to wonder what had happened to you.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay maxaa kugu dhacay.
Also, as I said.	Sidoo kale, sida aan sheegay.
One said it was too small.	Mid ayaa sheegay in ay aad u yar tahay.
No luck here.	Nasiib ma leh halkan.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale sameeyo si hubaal ah.
But he may not understand it clearly.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan si cad u fahmin.
He didn't need to see it.	Uma uu baahnayn inuu arko.
I don’t even have to say anything else.	Xitaa ma aha inaan wax kale sheego.
He promised to do something about it.	Wuxuu ballan qaaday inuu wax ka qaban doono.
There is something about that.	Wax baa jira taas.
But, don't lie to me anymore.	Laakiin, mar dambe been ha ii sheegin.
There was a lot of interest here.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo halkan ka xiiso lahaa.
Just beautiful long.	Kaliya dheer qurux badan.
Absolutely not.	Dhab ahaantii ma jirto.
We need to do that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan samayno taas.
It really isn't.	Runtii uma eka.
As it was.	Sida uu ahaa.
But no one succeeded.	Laakiin qofna ma guulaysan.
would be.	noqon lahaa.
I would like to know the best way to do this.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sida ugu wanaagsan ee tan loo sameeyo.
But no one knew what to do.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayn waxa la sameeyo.
There is no cooking	Ma jiro cunto karin
There was more than enough as it was.	Waxa jiray in ka badan oo ku filan sidii ay ahayd.
He wants to see you.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ku arko.
What a place.	Waa maxay meel.
This is a big problem	Tani waa dhib weyn
More, more, he said.	Wax badan, ka badan, ayuu yidhi.
He has not yet spoken.	Weli ma uusan hadlin.
Probably so.	Malaha waa sidaas.
I don't know what it is.	Ma garanayo waxa ay tahay.
He left a lot.	Wax badan buu ka baxay.
I wanted money anyway.	Waxaan rabay lacag si walba.
You told us.	Waad noo sheegtay.
I had to tell her.	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego.
It is loved and needed and wanted.	Waa lagu jecel yahay oo loo baahan yahay oo la rabaa.
But you can do something about it.	Laakiin taas ayaad wax ka qaban kartaa.
Now, she does.	Hadda, way samaysay.
Even better is that you do not exist.	Xitaa ka sii fiican ayaa ah inaadan jirin.
There was so much.	Waxaa jiray wax badan.
Very, very good !.	Aad iyo aad u fiican!.
Not just work, but everything.	Ma aha oo kaliya shaqada, laakiin wax walba.
I just couldn't find it.	Kaliya waan heli waayay.
I love new things	Waxaan jeclahay waxyaabo cusub
I looked.	Waan eegay.
I did not want to	Maan rabin
Like, every day.	Sida, maalin kasta.
That will be a great day, that will be a great tomorrow.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa maalin weyn, taasi waxay noqon doontaa berrito weyn.
But I must not.	Laakiin waa in aan.
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
I no longer understood.	Mar dambe ma fahmin.
It was not so close.	Ma ahayn sidaas u dhow.
He looked at me.	Dib buu ii eegay.
Here is why.	Waa kan sababta.
He asked her to hold me.	Waxa uu ka codsaday in uu i haysto.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
And now this.	Oo hadda kan.
I know he can.	Waan ogahay inuu awoodo.
But you can do it.	Laakiin waad samayn kartaa.
I knew it would be so.	Waan ogaa inay sidaas noqon doonto.
I will deal with it here from now on.	Halkan ayaan wax ka qaban doonaa hadda ka dib.
He looked constantly.	Si joogto ah ayuu u eegay.
The longer, the better.	Inta dheer, ka sii fiican.
He had no money.	Wax lacag ah ma uu haysan.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa inuu fiicnaan doono.
But he was a good man, a very good man.	Laakiin waxa uu ahaa nin wanaagsan, nin aad u wanaagsan.
Do not take anything for granted.	Waxba ha u qaadan.
But he said nothing.	Laakiin waxba kama odhan jirin.
That is what will happen.	Taasi waa waxa dhici doona.
I decided to go for real.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan si dhab ah u tago.
To do.	Si loo sameeyo.
But it's not really that difficult.	Laakiin runtii sidaas uma dhib badna.
What do you need to know?	Maxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato?
I think there is something.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax jiraan.
Who refused ?.	Yaa diiday?.
This is a lot.	Tani waa wax badan.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
Other bad stuff, too.	Waxyaabo kale oo xun, sidoo kale.
One knew what it looked like.	Mid baa ogaa sida ay u egtahay.
they did not like me.	ima ay jeclayn.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I got a good job.	Waxaan helay shaqo fiican.
I was surprised to see how much she still needed.	Waxaan la yaabay inaan arko sida ay weli u baahan tahay.
He refused to cooperate.	Wuu diiday inuu la shaqeeyo.
There is so much to love.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la jecel yahay.
Bad idea.	Fikrad xun.
I will tell him.	Waan u sheegi doonaa.
You may be one of them.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ka mid tahay.
There was no one there.	Meesha qofna ma jirin.
He thought he would leave.	Wuxuu mooday inuu ka bixi doono.
Very close.	Aad u dhow.
I refused anything.	Waxba waan diiday.
In fact, say no more.	Dhab ahaantii, wax ka badan ha odhan.
Tell him to leave.	U sheeg inuu baxo.
So far no problems.	Ilaa hadda wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
Somehow, he always was.	Si ahaan, wuxuu had iyo jeer ahaa.
You are very smart.	Aad baad u caqli badan tahay.
I want to know if he will be fine.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado inuu fiicnaan doono.
Nothing was right.	Waxba sax ma ahayn.
There was no time.	Waqti ma jirin.
I can do something here.	Waxaan wax ka qaban karaa halkan.
And another, and another.	Iyo mid kale, iyo mid kale.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
Just hard.	Kaliya mid adag.
I wanted to get to know you better.	Waxaan rabay inaan si fiican kuu barto.
He may not know anything about its contents.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanu waxba ka garanayn waxa ku jira.
I just did.	Kaliya waan sameeyay.
Three more years.	Saddex sano oo kale.
No one could do it.	Qofna ma samayn karin.
It is a beautiful car in person.	Waa baabuur qurux badan qof ahaan.
Not good.	Ma wanaagsan.
I love it I love it	waan jeclahay waan jeclahay
I am very happy if you can help me.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay haddii aad i caawin karto.
A lot of it was good, but not good.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan, laakiin ma ahan mid wanaagsan.
I got this	tan waan helay
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
She really has to go to school.	Runtii waa in ay aado dugsiga.
Definitely love it.	Dhab ahaan u jecel.
I really felt that way.	Dhab ahaantii waan dareemay taas.
It's just me.	Waa aniga oo kaliya.
I don't know if it still exists.	Ma garanayo in ay wali jirto.
He does the same with others.	Sidaas ayuu ula sameeyaa dadka kale.
We are separated.	Waa nala kala tagay.
That is not surprising.	Taasi la yaab maaha.
I did not say this.	Ma odhan tan.
It could not be paid.	Lama bixin karin.
There is nothing else he can do.	Wax kale oo uu samayn karo ma jirto.
I was not the one who made people.	Anigu ma ahayn kii dadka ka dhigay.
That is the good thing about this.	Taasi waa waxa ku fiican tan.
But it will take time.	Laakiin waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
Obviously not you.	Sida cad adiga maaha.
This was a bad idea.	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
He just didn't want to.	Kaliya ma uu rabin.
I'm sure he would.	Waan hubaa inuu yeeli lahaa.
They will tell me that this can happen to anyone.	Waxay ii sheegi doonaan in tani ay ku dhici karto qof kasta.
He will give whatever he has.	Wax kasta oo uu haysto wuu siin doonaa.
We live for a while.	Waxaan nool nahay muddo.
This is not correct.	Tani sax uma eka.
I want to be a person.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof.
Old friends, new, true.	Saaxiibo hore, cusub, oo run ah.
Do not let him say anything.	Ha u ogolaan inuu wax sheego.
Take another.	Mid kale qaado.
It can still be done.	Weli waa la samayn karaa.
And find out what it means to you.	Oo la ogaado waxa ay adiga kugu tahay.
People like that.	Dadka sidaas oo kale ah.
There are few of us.	Waxaa jira in yar oo naga mid ah.
He's gone now.	Hadda ayuu baxay.
I could not see clearly.	Si cad ayaan u arki waayay.
She knew she didn't want to.	Way ogaatay inaysan rabin.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
What is it.	Waa maxay.
As we need it.	Sida aan ugu baahanahay.
I can see it all now.	Waan arki karaa dhammaan hadda.
He left.	Wuu ka tagay.
He knew everything and nothing.	Wax walba wuu ogaa oo waxba.
I know it looks like a lot.	Waan ogahay inay u egtahay wax badan.
I couldn't think of anything else.	Wax kale uma malayn karin.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
Surely you can do better than that.	Hubaal waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka wanaagsan taas.
He didn't even do that.	Xitaa taas ma uu samayn.
Really much smaller.	Runtii aad uga yar.
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, runtii.
She would not return.	Ma soo noqon lahayd.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I want him to do it.	Waxaan rabaa inuu sameeyo.
He must have known that.	Waa inuu taas ogaa.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
I really did nothing.	Runtii waxba maan samayn.
I think they are.	Waxaan filayaa inay yihiin.
It is not difficult to say.	Ma aha in la sheego adag.
Maybe they are, really, really good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay runtii, runtii wanaagsan yihiin.
Not without him telling him everything.	Ma aha isaga oo aan wax walba u sheegin.
This can be anything.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
I think it was him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay isaga.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
It was a very bad idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad aad u xun.
You had to do what you did.	Waxay ahayd inaad sameyso waxaad samaysay.
I didn't want to tell you.	Maan jeclayn inaan kuu sheego.
It is something we do.	Waa wax aan samayno.
I love that !.	waan jeclahay taas!.
I can tell why.	Waxaan u sheegi karaa sababta.
I will see you	waan ku arki doonaa
I can't say anything yet.	Waxba ma odhan karo weli.
I know that very well.	Aad ayaan taas u garanayaa.
He took it all.	Wuu wada qaatay.
That she needs as much as she needs.	In ay u baahan tahay inta uu u baahan yahay.
But mostly for me.	Laakiin inta badan aniga.
She loves it here.	Way jeceshahay halkan.
Now, if only you.	Hadda, haddii aad kaliya.
But he heard me.	Laakiin wuu i maqlay.
But it does not look right now.	Laakiin hadda uma eka.
You are the only one who can not.	Waxaad tahay ka kaliya ee aan awoodin.
This should be good.	Tani waa inay wanaagsan tahay.
But everyone has.	Laakiin qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
I wanted more	Wax badan ayaan rabay
we will see him.	waan arki doonaa isaga.
He lives for us.	Wuu noo nool yahay.
Only, he did not have enough time.	Kaliya, ma uusan haysan waqti ku filan.
He knows me very well.	Aad ayuu ii garanayaa.
You probably will.	Waxay u badan tahay inaad sameyn doonto.
He hopes to get a better job.	Wuxuu rajeynayaa inuu helo shaqo ka fiican.
It may be the same for you.	Waxa ay noqon kartaa isku mid adiga.
They will see that you are smart.	Waxay arki doonaan inaad tahay qof caqli badan.
We will see that.	Waan arki doonaa taas.
He could not leave.	Wuu ka tagi waayay.
I am happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
He did not speak to anyone.	Cidna lama uu hadli jirin.
I'm not sure who said that at first.	Ma hubo cidda sidaas tidhi marka hore.
It was enough.	Waxay ahayd wax ku filan.
Maybe someone knows a lot about it.	Malaha qof baa wax badan ka yaqaan.
You know you are beautiful.	Waad ogtahay inaad qurux badan tahay.
He did not understand.	Ma uu fahmin.
He decided to leave.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu baxo.
No one was unemployed.	Ma jirin qof shaqo la’aan ah.
She said.	Way tidhi.
I do it every day.	Waxaan sameeyaa maalin kasta.
I had many friends.	Waxaan lahaa saaxiibo badan.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inuu ka hadlo.
I could not let him go.	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu baxo.
He’s very good, he’s really, really good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay, runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
What a great idea.	Waa maxay fikrad fiican.
I still do.	Wali waan sameeyaa.
tell me what you can do.	ii sheeg waxaad samayn karto.
Now you can see me.	Hadda waad i arki kartaa.
More and more and more and more.	In badan iyo in ka badan iyo in ka badan iyo in ka badan.
But nothing was found.	Laakiin waxba lama helin.
That was done.	In la sameeyay.
Another will not hurt.	Mid kale waxba ma yeeli doono.
Not too much.	Aad uma badna.
There was still not much work to be done with him.	Weli shaqo badan oo aan isaga la qaban ma jirin.
It is too late now.	Hadda waa goor dambe.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
Please tell if I am.	Fadlan u sheeg haddii aan ahay.
You did well !!.	Si fiican baad u samaysay!!.
He went to the door.	Albaabka ayuu aaday.
He told her everything he knew.	Wax walba oo uu garanayo ayuu u sheegay.
It's gone, just like that.	Waa tagay, sidaas oo kale.
I did not go.	Ma tagin.
I don't know what to do now.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo hadda.
He felt it.	Wuu dareemay.
Once it has to be done.	Mar waa in la sameeyaa.
There is also something he asked.	Waxa kale oo jira ayuu waydiiyay.
Here everyone can see him.	Halkan qof kastaa wuu arki karaa isaga.
It will not hurt you again.	Mar dambe kuma yeeli doonto.
Now, it was time to get ready.	Hadda, waxay ahayd markii ay diyaar ahayd.
He just didn't want to work on it anymore.	Kaliya ma uusan rabin inuu wax ka sii shaqeeyo.
Man and man.	Nin iyo nin.
But he got one real chance.	Laakiin hal fursad oo dhab ah ayuu helay.
A similar problem.	Dhibaato la mid ah.
sax	sax
I wanted to say.	Waxaan rabay inaan sheego.
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
But not really.	Laakiin ma run ahaantii.
Better than me.	Aniga iga fiican.
There was so much to see.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo la arki karo.
He told me he loved me and went to work.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu i jecel yahay oo uu shaqo u tagay.
I can't find a job.	Ma heli karo shaqo.
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
I know what she wants.	Waan ogahay waxay rabto.
I do not.	Anigu ma sameeyo.
It would not be.	Ma uu noqon lahaa.
It is a very close problem.	Waa dhibaato aad u dhow.
According to him, I got nothing less.	Sida uu sheegay, ma helin wax ka yar.
All other problems.	Dhibaato kale oo dhan.
I know the only place.	Waan ogahay meesha kaliya.
Less than nothing.	In ka yar waxba.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
Nothing else can be said.	Wax kale lama odhan karo.
There is not much time.	Ma jiro waqti badan.
I'm glad it's not included.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaysan taas ku jirin.
I think this really is.	Waxaan filayaa in tani runtii tahay.
He was not there.	Halkaas ma uu joogin.
One day.	Hal maalin.
There are many things to come anyway.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo soo socda si kasta.
This was a good idea.	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
Bad is good.	Xun ayaa wanaagsan.
That's right.	Waa sax.
It even looks great.	Xitaa waxay u egtahay mid aad u weyn.
She needs me.	Way ii baahan tahay.
I don't want to know you.	Ma rabo inaan ku ogaado.
It's an amazing place.	Waa meel yaab leh.
There must be more than this.	Waa inay jiraan wax ka badan tan.
That is why he has never been lucky.	Taasi waa sababta uusan waligiis nasiib u helin.
I just don’t know that.	Kaliya ma garanayo taas.
He did not return.	Ma uu soo noqon.
It really is.	Runtii waa sidaas.
Hard place, that.	Meel adag, taasi.
Really, it’s a great place.	Runtii, waa meel fiican.
That is what we do.	Taas oo ah waxa aanu samayno.
, not me.	, aniga maaha.
Not as close as it should be.	Uma dhawaan sida uu noqon lahaa.
But that was not true.	Laakiin taasi sax ma ahayn.
This is not a certainty today.	Tani ma ahan wax la hubo maanta.
That was for others.	Taasi waxay ahayd dadka kale.
I really wanted to.	si xun ayaan u rabay.
You must be happy.	Waa inaad faraxsan tahay.
We need something new, something new.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax cusub, wax cusub.
Very good, probably.	Aad u fiican, waxay u badan tahay.
I really didn't mind.	Runtii dhib uma helin.
Who does not like him.	Yaa aan jeclayn isaga.
I never got it.	Weligay ma helin.
Everyone in it.	Qof kasta oo ku jira.
And who might not even believe me.	Oo yaa laga yaabaa in aan xitaa i rumaysan.
I will not return.	Soo noqon maayo.
He was a good man to you.	Nin wanaagsan buu kuu ahaa.
Obviously, I didn’t like the way she did it.	Sida cad, ma jeclayn sida ay u samaysay.
I wanted her to do everything and everything.	Waxaan rabay inay sameyso wax kasta iyo wax walba.
I was ready to do something.	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan wax sameeyo.
It is very fast.	Aad ayuu u degdeg badan yahay.
Probably, maybe.	Malaha, waa laga yaabaa.
It is the least we can do.	Waa waxa ugu yar ee aan sameyn karno.
It was a clear day.	Waxay ahayd maalin cad.
There was nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la sameeyo ma jirin.
Really, it wasn’t.	Runtii, ma ahayn.
Every day was the same.	Maalin kasta waxay ahayd isku mid.
That it is very bad.	In ay aad u xun tahay.
.	.
No one was there to help.	Qofna ma joogin si uu u caawiyo.
you were right	sax baad ahayd
This cannot be done.	Tan lama samayn karo.
A very difficult time.	Waqti aad u dhib badan.
I have never been able to see that.	Weligay ma awoodin inaan arko taas.
It can't help as it is.	Ma caawin karto sida ay tahay.
But now both are gone.	Laakiin hadda labaduba waa la waayay.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa.
It is not smart.	Ma ahan mid caqli badan.
If that doesn't help there is nothing I can do.	Haddii taasi ay caawin weyday wax aan sameyn karo ma jiraan.
As you can see, we are very busy today.	Sida aad arki karto, maanta aad ayaan mashquul u nahay.
I think everyone does too !.	Waxay ila tahay in qof walba sidoo kale!.
You can get him now if you want him.	Waad heli kartaa isaga hadda haddii aad isaga rabto.
She did it.	Way u samaysay.
But there is a lot of controversy.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo la isku haysto.
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad fiican.
Do not separate us.	Ha na kala tagin.
You can stop this.	Waad joojin kartaa tan.
It was not too difficult.	Ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
Everyone saw it.	Qof kastaa wuu arkay.
Very well known.	Aad baa loo yaqaan.
He should have known.	Waa inuu ogaa.
I had no idea how to tell the truth.	Wax fikrad ah kama aan lahayn sida loo sheego wax run ah.
I hope you will help !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ku caawin doonto!.
That is where I will be.	Taas oo ah meesha aan joogi doono.
It will go beyond this.	Way ka bixi doontaa tan.
They love what they do.	Waxay jecel yihiin waxay sameeyaan.
That is a lot of work.	Taasi waa shaqo badan.
A long time ago.	Waqti dheer ka hor.
I had to stop him.	Waxay ahayd inaan joojin karo isaga.
This is not all.	Tani ma aha dhammaan.
It was a day for him.	Waxay u ahayd maalin.
He was in school.	Dugsiga ayuu ku jiray.
It will not be a problem.	Dhib ma ahaan doono.
It would be tonight.	Waxay noqon lahayd caawa.
And here is another idea.	Oo halkan waa fikrad kale.
She would go to him.	Way u tagi lahayd isaga.
I really got it.	Runtii waan helay.
And often it is.	Oo inta badan waa.
I do not think it will happen today.	U malayn maayo inay maanta dhici doonto.
It 's good to have it.	Way fiican tahay ha haysto.
I told you the truth.	run baan kuu sheegay.
I heard what you have to say.	Waxaan maqlay waxaad leedahay.
I hope he is still alive.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu weli nool yahay.
She said so.	Waxay tidhi sidaas.
Maybe he was a man.	Malaha wuxuu ahaa nin.
It can still happen.	Weli way dhici kartaa.
That really is a good thing.	Runtii taasi waa wax fiican.
I have heard him say that many times.	In badan ayaan maqlay isaga oo sidaas leh.
She needs a job.	Waxay u baahan tahay shaqo.
No one wants this.	Qofna ma rabo kan.
I can no longer take it.	Mar dambe ma qaadan karo.
I knew he would do it.	Waan ogaa inuu yeeli doono.
There was someone else at home.	Waxaa jiray qof kale oo guriga joogay.
This did not do any good.	Tani wax wanaagsan ma samayn.
It is not wise.	Caqli ma aha.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
So far there is no such thing.	Ilaa hadda wax la mid ah ma jiraan.
It just exists here.	Halkan kaliya ayaa jira.
I don't want him.	Ma rabo isaga mid.
She realized she couldn't.	Way ogaatay inaysan awoodin.
This is what is said.	Tani waa waxa lagu yidhi.
He would not do such a thing.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma uu samayn lahayn.
I have more here than you.	Waxaan halkan ku leeyahay wax ka badan adiga.
I hope it will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
I saw it, but not today.	Waan arkay, laakiin maanta maaha.
Only needed.	Kaliya loo baahan yahay.
That was smart.	Taasi waxay ahayd caqli badan.
Very interesting idea.	Fikrad aad u xiiso badan.
It was a difficult day.	Waxay u ahayd maalin adag.
A man was surprised.	Nin baa yaabay.
He will stay here for a long time.	Wuxuu halkan joogi doonaa wakhti dheer.
Like others.	Sida dadka kale.
But very good.	Laakiin aad u fiican.
Sorry, that's what it is.	Waan ka xumahay, waa waxa ay tahay.
More, more will come.	Wax badan, wax badan ayaa iman doona.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay lahayn.
Not everyone is the same.	Qof walba isku mid maaha.
It's a beautiful day today, isn't it?	Waa maalin qurux badan maanta, saw maaha?
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
You will need it	Waxaad u baahan doontaa
He is really happy there.	Runtii wuu ku faraxsan yahay halkaas.
We would get it, too, if it weren’t for.	Waan heli lahayn, sidoo kale, haddii aysan jirin.
I really tried.	Runtii waan isku dayay.
This was known.	Tani waa la ogaa.
It may take some time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa xoogaa waqti ah.
It must have been.	Waa inay ahayd.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
He thought otherwise.	Si kale ayuu u maleeyay.
Him.	Isaga.
That is a long time.	Taasi waa wakhti dheer.
If not, that's a real problem.	Haddii aysan taasi ahayn, taasi waa dhibaato dhab ah.
He wanted to do this alone.	Waxa uu rabay in uu kan keligiis sameeyo.
Good luck to him.	Nasiib isaga.
That is, to this day.	Taasi waa, ilaa maanta.
She is very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
I would love that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa taas.
you were right	sax baad ahayd
That is why it is there.	Taasi waa sababta ay halkaas u tahay.
I should not have done this.	Ma ahayn inaan tan sameeyo.
It's a small problem.	Waa dhibaato yar.
I can't help it	kuma caawin karo
I started very little.	Waxaan bilaabay aad u yar.
Tell them why.	U sheeg sababta.
But there is plenty of food.	Laakiin waxaa jira cunto badan.
That's enough, he said to himself.	Waa ku filan tahay, ayuu is yidhi.
They did not tell anyone why.	Sababta cidna uma ay sheegi jirin.
Same for every man.	La mid ah nin kasta.
He was a strong friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib adag.
But that doesn't matter.	Laakiin taasi waxba maaha.
But it is definitely a lie.	Laakiin hubaal waa been.
This has already been done.	Tan hore ayaa loo sameeyay.
Interesting, good stuff.	Wax xiiso leh, waxyaabo fiican.
That may not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon karto.
It was not difficult for him.	Ma ahayn wax adag isaga.
Doing good will probably help.	Samaynta wax wanaagsan waxay u badan tahay inay ku caawin doonto.
That's right.	Sax, waa yaa.
I think it was just me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aniga kaliya ahayd.
Good luck!.	Nasiib wanaagsan!.
We would do that again and again.	Mar kasta oo kale sidaas ayaan yeeli lahayn.
Now something would happen	Hadda wax ayaa dhici lahaa
No problem	Dhib ma rabo
That, first.	Taasi, marka hore.
He told the truth.	Run buu u sheegay.
He said he needed more time.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu u baahan yahay waqti badan.
I refused to talk to him.	Waan diiday inaan la hadlo.
I know it's probably not the right thing to do.	Waan ogahay inay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
But it will be fine.	Laakiin way fiicnaan doontaa.
It should not be too difficult.	Waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
As it was.	Sidii ay ahayd.
I like that he wants to work.	Waxaan jeclahay in uu rabo inuu shaqeeyo.
You think so.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa.
Maybe that will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ku caawin doonto.
Whatever it will be, it will be.	Wax kasta oo noqon doona, waxay noqon doontaa.
Very fast.	Aad u degdeg badan.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
That was also great.	Taasi waxay sidoo kale ahayd mid aad u fiican.
You were a real friend.	Waxaad ahayd saaxiib dhab ah.
I know enough is enough for you.	Waan ogahay in kugu filan.
That would be amazing.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd yaab.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Everything you need is there.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay ayaa jira.
Everyone has this.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay tan.
It was a great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u wanaagsan.
Mostly, probably.	Inta badan, malaha.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
Very, very.	Aad iyo aad.
It is not right to do that.	Sax maaha in taas la sameeyo.
They do this.	Tani waxay sameeyaan.
She will tell you.	Way kuu sheegi doontaa.
He never understood that it did not matter to me.	Waligiis ma uu fahmin in aanay aniga waxba igu ahayn.
This looks like a good opportunity.	Tani waxay u egtahay fursad wanaagsan.
He said he didn't.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu samayn.
There is not much going on.	Wax badan oo socda ma jiraan.
He could not handle it.	Waa uu ka qaban waayay.
I think I love you.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan ku jeclahay.
But it is a bigger job.	Laakiin waa shaqo ka weyn.
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
Something you need to know.	Wax aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
I never understood that.	Weligay taas ma fahmin.
I have another.	Mid kale ayaan leeyahay.
Very busy indeed.	Mashquul badan runtii.
Maybe you will be fine.	Malaha waad fiicnaan doontaa.
He had me.	Wuu i lahaa.
I have tried it several times.	Waxaan isku dayay dhowr jeer.
Not even better.	Xitaa ka sii fiican malaha.
Everyone is happy, very happy.	Qof kastaa wuu faraxsan yahay, aad ayuu u faraxsan yahay.
It didn't take long.	Waqti kuma ay soo bixin.
He can be a very tough guy.	Wuxuu noqon karaa nin aad u adag.
He seemed surprised by this.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid la yaabay arrintan.
I'll see you soon	waan ku arki doonaa dhawaan
I think it was.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd.
I've seen this a lot.	In badan ayaan tan arkay.
I can't believe no one will help.	Ma rumaysan karo qofna ma caawin doono.
But it will take hard work and time.	Laakiin waxay qaadan doontaa shaqo adag iyo waqti.
Tell them.	U sheeg.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
But it should.	Laakiin waa inay.
We are three of them.	Waxaan nahay saddex ka mid ah.
I look forward to working with you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan kula shaqeeyo.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
I don't like it here anymore.	Ma jecli halkan mar dambe.
He would have been here a long time.	Waxa uu halkan joogi lahaa wakhti dheer.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
There was enough time to get out.	Waxaa jiray waqti ku filan oo lagu bixi karo.
I'm sure a good friend.	Waxaan hubaa saaxiib wanaagsan.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
He will not stay home.	Guriga ma joogi doono.
He is a good person.	Waa qof wanaagsan.
Too much to do.	Aad u badan in la sameeyo.
She is very good at that.	Aad bay ugu fiican tahay taas.
He wants to help.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu caawiyo.
I hope it will not take long.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan waqti badan qaadan doonin.
This was.	Tani waxay ahayd.
I have seen a lot.	Wax badan baan arkay.
One more man.	Hal nin oo kale.
I am very sorry about that.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas.
It is very much needed.	Aad baa loo baahan yahay.
He picked it up and took it home.	Inta uu soo qaaday ayuu u soo qaaday guriga.
It may not be long.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay muddo dheer ahayn.
Something to eat.	Wax la cuno.
It can help here.	Way ku caawin kartaa halkan.
This is the best job for me.	Tani waa shaqada ugu fiican aniga.
I know where everyone lives.	Waan ogahay meesha qof walba ku nool yahay.
It was the latter.	Waxay ahayd tan dambe.
I would do more	wax badan ayaan qaban lahaa
I was just not ready.	Kaliya diyaar uma ahayn.
We will get it right.	Waan heli doonaa si sax ah.
I think that would be great.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd.
You can talk to him.	Waad la hadli kartaa isaga.
I don't know what will happen.	Ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
I did not say.	Ma aan sheegin.
No one does.	Qofna ma sameeyo.
I am happy to be here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan joogo
He had many friends.	Wuxuu lahaa saaxiibo badan.
Same thing every day.	Wax la mid ah maalin kasta.
I was.	Waxaan ahaa.
Great surprise there.	La yaab weyn halkaas.
That will do it now.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa hadda.
You have to be good at it.	Waa inaad ku fiican tahay.
Maybe you won	Malaha waad guulaysan
This was a lie.	Tani waxay ahayd been.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
Really? 	Runtii?
He could not leave.	Waa uu bixi waayay.
It is nothing.	Ma aha wax.
That would be beautiful.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid qurux badan.
I think it doesn't exist yet.	Waxaan filayaa in aanay wali jirin.
I can't say	Ma sheegi karo
I paid.	Lacag baan siiyay.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Waxba, waxba, waxba.
I tried it, you know.	Waan isku dayay, waad ogtahay.
I just don't understand how.	Kaliya ma fahmin sida.
That’s how things are.	Taasi waa sida ay wax yihiin.
But this is not a thing.	Laakiin tani maaha wax.
No one said.	Qofna ma sheegin.
I think that's right.	Waxay ila tahay sax.
Nin nin nin kan.	Nin nin nin kan.
Everyone was here.	Qof kastaa wuu joogay halkan.
It must not be done.	Waa inaan la samayn.
And he stayed.	Oo iska joogay .
The former is the best.	Kan hore ayaa ugu fiican.
There was a good time here once.	Waxaa jiray waqti fiican halkan hal mar.
I have done it before.	Hore ayaan u sameeyay.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
I hope for the best.	Waxaan rajeynayaa wax wanaagsan.
She did that.	Way samaysay taas.
It is not very difficult.	Ma aha mid aad u adag.
This was really.	Tani waxay ahayd run ahaantii.
I need to work with you on that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan taas kula shaqeeyo.
I felt the same way.	Waxaan dareemay sidaas oo kale.
Maybe you did.	Malaha waad samaysay.
I told him everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegay.
I am smaller than this.	Aniga ayaa ka yar kan.
I can't do this.	Ma samayn karo tan.
Just don't go there.	Kaliya ha tagin meesha.
It's an amazing place.	Waa meel la yaab leh.
He has something to do with it, too.	Wax buu ku leeyahay, sidoo kale.
There was not much.	Wax badan ma jirin.
Everyone can see that.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa taas.
I will do this every day.	Waxaan samayn doonaa tan maalin kasta.
But it would be nice.	Laakiin way fiicnaan lahayd.
I felt really great.	Waxaan dareemay runtii wax weyn.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
This is how it looks.	Tani waa sida ay u egtahay.
You don't need anything else.	Wax kale uma baahnid.
He looked up and saw.	Wuu eegay oo arkay.
He did not say where to go.	Ma sheegin meel loo tago.
She needs a job.	Waxay u baahan tahay shaqo.
Now started.	Hadda la bilaabay.
That will do.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa.
You certainly know that.	Waa hubaal inaad taas ogtahay.
It probably is bad.	Waxay u badan tahay inay xun tahay.
She should know.	Waa in ay ogaato.
You can tell me anything.	Waxaad ii sheegi kartaa wax kasta.
I don't want anything	waxba ma rabo
I’m not sure if anyone else really can.	Ma hubo in qof kale uu dhab ahaantii awoodo.
I have to find him.	Waa inaan helo isaga.
You can get as much as you want.	Waxaad heli kartaa inta aad rabto.
I don't want to do that.	Ma rabo inaan taas sameeyo.
I think it is.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay.
It is given.	Waa la siiyay.
There is nothing you can do now.	Ma jiraan wax aad hadda ka qaban karto.
I had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah kama aan haysan.
He knows you are not what he wants.	Wuu ogyahay inaadan ahayn waxa uu rabo.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I looked up	Waxaan eegay meel dhow
But he thought they would be him.	Laakiin wuxuu mooday inay isaga noqon doonaan.
He did not want to come here.	Ma uusan rabin inuu halkan yimaado.
I was trying to find a new job.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan shaqo cusub helo.
He saw what happened.	Wuu arkay wixii dhacay.
I'm sorry	waan ka xumahay
You know, that's just great.	Waad ogtahay, taas oo kaliya weyn.
Didn't you tell him.	Miyaadan u sheegin.
There was not much else to do.	Wax badan oo kale oo la samayn lahaa ma jirin.
Maybe he likes you a lot.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ku jecel yahay wax badan.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
Please tell me.	Fadlan ii sheeg.
I do nothing.	Waxba waan sameeyaa.
That is the main thing now.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn hadda.
That is who you are.	Taasi waa qofka aad tahay.
I can't stop.	Ma joojin karo.
i want to go	waxaan rabaa inaan tago
What to do now?	Hadda maxaa la sameeyaa?.
I could not go.	Waan u tagi waayay.
He did not.	Ma uusan qaban.
I tried	waan isku dayay
I told him I needed more money.	Waxaan u sheegay inaan u baahanahay lacag badan.
It looks beautiful	Waxay u egtahay qurux
They will need him more than they think.	Waxay u baahan doonaan isaga in ka badan inta ay la tahay.
There is nothing she can do.	Wax ay qaban karto ma jirto.
It is everything now.	Waa wax walba hadda.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
I'm really scared.	Runtii waan ka baqayaa in aan.
He would be great to work with.	Wuu ku fiicnaan lahaa inuu la shaqeeyo.
But maybe he does.	Laakiin malaha wuu sameeyaa.
It is difficult for him to have time to see you.	Way ku adag tahay inuu haysto wakhti uu ku arko.
I have a lot.	Wax badan baan hayaa.
He is very lucky.	Waa nasiib badan yahay.
I would love to go	Aad ayaan u jeclahay inaan aado
I think they do not.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaysan samayn.
It cannot be true.	Run ma noqon karto.
I did not know you would come.	Maan garanayn inaad iman doonto.
How nice!	Sidee u fiican!
It is difficult to do everything.	Way adag tahay in wax walba la sameeyo.
I can not achieve this.	Ma guulaysan karo tan.
Few really are.	In yar ayaa dhab ahaantii ah.
I was not ready for this.	Diyaar uma ahayn tan.
Tried but did not know how to help.	Isku dayay laakiin ma garanayn sida loo caawiyo.
All were rejected.	Dhammaan waa la diiday.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
It would happen.	Way dhici lahayd.
This is not so much.	Tani maaha mid aad u badan.
There is little else.	Wax kale oo yar baa jira.
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
I am the only one who can talk about this.	Anigu waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee ay kala hadli karto arrintan.
That is something we do.	Taasi waa wax aan samayno.
To be seen.	In la arko.
Surely this would be a better place.	Hubaal tani waxay ahaan lahayd meel ka wanaagsan.
I don't want to.	Ima ay rabin.
I do this every day.	Waxaan sameeyaa tan iyo taas maalin kasta.
No one is talking.	Qofna lama hadlo.
Don't let them know about this.	Ha u ogolaan in aad tan wax ka ogaato.
This was a great time.	Tani waxay ahayd waqti weyn.
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
And maybe they are.	Oo laga yaabo inay yihiin.
I'll talk to you later	dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa
There was nothing else.	Ma jirin wax kale oo kale.
Less, if any.	In ka yar, haddii ay jiraan.
That was what she was going to come up with.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ay u iman lahayd.
This was true.	Tani run bay ahayd.
But maybe it was.	Laakiin malaha waxay ahayd.
I was just there.	Kaliya waan joogay.
Will it be done?	Ma la samayn doonaa?
I know it's real.	Waan ogahay inay dhab tahay.
This was so beautiful.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u qurux badan.
what did you say	maxaad tidhi
This is very strange.	Tani waa wax aad yaab leh.
One cannot be right.	Mid ka mid ah ma noqon karo mid sax ah.
I did not speak.	Ma aan hadlin.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
He is not able to eat properly.	Ma awoodo inuu si sax ah wax u cuno.
I told her she didn't have to do anything.	Waxa aan u sheegay in aanay ahayn in ay wax samayso.
When I need it.	Marka aan u baahanahay.
But there is much we can do.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo aan sameyn karno.
It certainly had something.	Hubaal wax baa lahaa.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu doonayo inuu iibsado.
But you have.	Laakiin waad leedahay.
This can happen at any time.	Tani waxay dhici kartaa wakhti kasta.
It really wasn’t true.	Dhab ahaantii run ma ahayn.
She was always busy.	Had iyo jeer mashquul bay ahayd.
Not sure what they will be.	Ma hubo waxa ay noqon doonaan.
As long as you can go	Inta aad tagi karto
I love having it.	Waxaan jeclahay in aan haysto.
Both are small.	Labaduba waa wax yar.
No one can tell you the location.	Qofna kuma sheegi karo meesha.
They will come back to me with that.	Way igu soo noqon doonaan taas.
But how? 	Laakiin sidee?
It's one I love.	Waa mid aan jeclahay.
I wanted to be him.	Waxaan rabay inaan isaga noqdo.
Now you work.	Hadda aad shaqada.
There was no one else.	Qof kale ma jirin.
Everyone has heard.	Qof kastaa wuu maqlay.
It's just me here.	Waa aniga kaliya halkan.
It is close.	Waa u dhow yahay.
I'm sure everyone knows.	Waxaan hubaa in qof walba garanayo.
You will find me.	Waxaad heli doontaa aniga.
More than a surprise.	In ka badan yaab.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
But it is beautiful.	Laakiin waa wax qurux badan.
Which is good for me.	Taas oo aniga ila fiican.
But he is in a good place.	Laakiin meel fiican ayuu joogaa.
It's hard to say if you're not there.	Way adag tahay in la sheego haddii aadan halkaas joogin.
I had something good going on.	Waxaan lahaa wax fiican oo socda.
I wanted to be sorry.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka xumahay.
That you are	In aad tahay
None.	Ma jirto.
And the same for him.	Oo isla isaga isaga.
He knows nothing.	Waxba wuu garanayaa.
As she found out she didn't know.	Sida ay ku ogaatay in aanay garanayn.
You will be with us here	Waxaad nala joogi doontaa halkan
Another went.	Mid kale ayaa tagay.
Tell me something else.	Wax kale ii sheeg.
I will not be there.	Anigu halkaas ma joogi doono.
And maybe they will.	Oo malaha way yeeli doonaan.
Please tell me now	Fadlan hadda ii sheeg
That is a problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato.
I know again.	Waan ogahay mar kale.
We would be here again.	Halkan mar kale ayaan joogi lahayn.
I know, a bad idea.	Waan ogahay, fikrad xun.
Iyo.	Iyo.
More, and more, and more.	In ka badan, iyo in ka badan, iyo in ka badan.
You are the best.	Adiga ayaa ugu fiican.
That, too, is complicated.	Taas, sidoo kale, waa mid adag.
I will not say.	Ma odhan doono.
But it is enough.	Laakiin way ku filan tahay.
He has an urgent appointment.	Wuxuu leeyahay ballan degdeg ah.
There is something you need to know.	Waxaa jira wax ay tahay inaad ogaato.
There was nothing else to do here.	Ma jirin wax kale oo ay halkan ku sameeyaan.
I thought it was the same thing.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax la mid ah.
Good stuff.	Waxyaabo wanaagsan.
It would all be fine.	Dhammaan way fiicnaan lahayd.
It is truly a beautiful place.	Runtii waa meel aad u qurux badan.
I lost my place	Waxaan waayay meel
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
No one really knows what to do.	Qofna ma garanayo runtii waxa la sameeyo.
I didn't find anything.	waxba maan helin.
I put it	waan dhigay
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ma ahayn wax weyn.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin tani maaha.
There was no other option.	Fursad kale ma jirin.
No one believed me.	Qofna ima rumaysan.
I don't have him.	Uma haysto isaga.
It seems like a big deal.	Waxay ila tahay wax weyn.
I have never seen him so bad.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo xun.
I have not seen much.	Wax badan maan arag.
I knew something was wrong.	Waxaan ogaa in wax aan sax ahayn.
There was so much to do!	Waxaa jiray wax badan in la sameeyo!
I still want to	Wali waan rabaa
I think that's very good, very interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aad u fiican tahay, aad u xiiso badan.
There was enough time after that.	Waxaa jiray waqti ku filan taas ka dib.
There is some truth to that.	Waxaa jira xoogaa run ah taas.
We can't talk here.	Halkan kama wada hadli karno.
Let it be known, he said to himself.	Ha la ogaado, ayuu is yidhi.
I don't do it now.	Hadda ma sameeyo.
But still, there are.	Laakiin weli, way jiraan.
Each one.	Mid kasta oo dhan.
It is difficult to know.	Way adag tahay in la ogaado.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
But only if you want to.	Laakiin kaliya haddii aad rabto.
I think there is something you want from me.	Waxaan filayaa inay jiraan wax aad iga rabto.
But, again, maybe not.	Laakiin, mar kale, malaha.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
Otherwise, who knows.	Haddii kale, yaa yaqaan.
But it is not the same.	Laakiin isku mid maaha.
I got it another day.	Waxaan helay maalin kale.
But he did not tell anyone why.	Laakiin cidna uma uu sheegin sababta.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
Every one of us would love to.	Qof kasta oo naga mid ah wuu jeclaan lahaa.
He wondered how it was.	Waxa uu la yaabay sida ay tahay.
They will always be there.	Had iyo jeer way joogi doonaan.
Everyone wanted something from him.	Qof kastaa isaga wax buu ka rabay.
Who and more.	Yaa iyo ka badan.
But we do not.	Laakiin ma samayno.
They do not do much.	Aad u badan ma sameeyaan.
Something has always been.	Wax had iyo jeer ahaa.
Either way, it wasn’t food.	Si kasta oo ay ahayd, cunto ma ahayn.
At home.	Guriga.
But they did nothing.	Laakiin waxba kuma ay samayn.
This will take a very long time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
It is now done.	Hadda waa la sameeyay.
I know what he would do.	Waan garanayaa wuxuu samayn lahaa.
I liked that	taas waan ka helay
Little known.	Wax yar oo la yaqaan.
This is a great opportunity.	Tani waa fursad weyn.
Can someone please help me with this.	Qof fadlan ma iga caawin karaa tan.
Tell them something else.	Wax kale u sheeg.
That will not hurt.	Taasi waxba ma yeeli doonto.
Now, that is.	Hadda, taasi waa.
We would do it every day.	Waxaan samayn lahayn maalin kasta.
It's a great place.	Waa meel fiican.
It is a long time.	Waa wakhti dheer.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
Just before.	Kaliya ka hor.
This can be fun after all.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid xiiso leh ka dib oo dhan.
I didn't want to talk to him.	Ma aanan rabin in aan la hadlo.
It was a good thing, as always.	Waxay ahayd wax fiican, sida had iyo jeer.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
Not from people.	Aan ka iman dadka.
Someone else did it.	Qof kale ayaa sidaas sameeyay.
How to 'come'	Sida 'loo yimaado'
We will see that.	Waan arki doonaa taas.
Everything he did is right.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyay waa sax.
Maybe I can't see anything.	Malaha waxba ma arki karo.
I knew that.	Waan ogaa taas.
As well.	Iyo sidoo kale.
Nothing could be further from the truth	Ma jiraan wax ka sii cad
Maybe this will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
He thought we could be friends.	Wuxuu mooday inaan saaxiibo noqon karno.
This should not take too long.	Tani waa inaysan qaadan waqti aad u dheer.
Enough to see.	Ku filan inuu arko.
I don't know how that will happen.	Ma garanayo sida ay taasi u dhici doonto.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
I know it will not end here.	Waan ogahay inaysan halkan ku dhammaan doonin.
It has to be more.	Waa in ay ka badan tahay.
But even if it was true.	Laakiin xitaa haddii ay run ahayd.
But it is so.	Laakiin waa sidaas oo kale.
Only owned.	Kaliya iska leh.
I went back to school today.	Waxaan dib ugu noqday dugsiga maanta.
At first, he looked at me as if he didn't know me.	Markii hore, wuxuu ii eegay sidii aanu i garanayn.
It's really good, really, really good.	Runtii waa wax aad u wanaagsan, runtii, runtii aad u wanaagsan.
All the rest.	Inta kale oo dhan.
That they do not go.	In aanay tagin.
You really are my favorite.	Runtii waxaad tahay kan aan jeclahay.
I really don't understand why.	Runtii ma fahmin sababta.
It felt strange.	Si la yaab leh ayaa loo dareemay.
It's up to you.	Waa mid adiga kugu ah.
I really don't think so.	Runtii uma malaynayo inay sidaas tahay.
I got nothing.	Waxba ma helin.
You did that.	Waad samaysay taas.
You are a very good man.	Nin aad baad u fiican tahay.
This is a serious problem.	Tani waa dhibaato adag.
He owned the house.	Wuxuu lahaa guriga.
Not to say anything about me.	Inaan waxba iga odhan.
That is too long.	Taasi aad bay u dheer tahay.
I had a great time.	Waxaan helay waqti aad u fiican.
And so, he never came back.	Oo sidaas oo kale, dib uma soo noqon.
That is a very good idea.	Taasi waa fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
He knew she should not do that.	Wuu ogaa in aanay ahayn in ay taas samayso.
But it may not be real.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan dhab ahayn.
I had a good time doing it	Waqti fiican ayaan ku qaatay samaynta
Still not lucky.	Weli nasiib ma leh.
What, what.	Waa maxay, waa maxay.
This did not stop him.	Tani ma aysan joojin isaga.
But the main thing is this.	Laakiin waxa ugu weyn waa kan.
You love me.	Waad i jeceshahay.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
As before.	Sidii hore oo kale.
But there was little.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax yar.
He thought it was great, too.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inay aad u fiican tahay, sidoo kale.
Is anyone there?	Qof ma joogaa?
It is still.	Waa weli.
There is really nothing you can do about it.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto arrintan.
Give it to him.	Sii isaga.
Do it right.	Si sax ah u qabo.
You can not do this.	Tan kuma samayn kartid.
I will help myself.	Waan is caawin doonaa.
That's what you told me.	Waa waxa aad ii sheegtay.
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
It is what you do.	Waa waxa aad samayso.
It was me.	Aniga ayuu ahaa.
And everyone else did.	Oo qof kasta oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
But now there was something else.	Laakiin hadda wax kale ayaa jiray.
It is available.	Waa la heli karo.
There is no man.	Ma jiro nin.
As long as they like it.	Ilaa inta ay jecel yihiin.
He was very determined.	Aad buu u go'aansaday.
I can't find him.	Anigu ma heli karo isaga.
First.	Marka hore.
I just have to know what it is.	Kaliya waa inaan ogaado waxa ay tahay.
It was just now.	Waxaa jiray kaliya hadda.
I do it often.	Inta badan waan sameeyaa.
He can say whatever he wants.	Wuxuu doono ayuu sheegi karaa.
Another time he said.	Waqti kale ayuu yidhi.
It's really bad.	Runtii waa mid xun.
He seemed to want to help.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu doonayo inuu caawiyo.
If you do not want to do that.	Haddii aadan rabin inaad taas samayso.
I would definitely be back.	Hubaal waan soo noqon lahaa.
He does not want to find me.	Ma rabo inuu i helo.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
Not yet.	Ilaa hadda ma aha.
He just told you.	Kaliya wuu kuu sheegay.
I expect to be told what is going on.	Waxaan filayaa in loo sheego waxa jira.
They are also new.	Sidoo kale waa cusub yihiin.
No time was given.	Waqti lama siin.
I want you now	hadda waan ku rabaa
But the rest.	Laakiin inta kale.
Please tell me what to do	Fadlan ii sheeg waxaan sameeyo
It is a very difficult job.	Waa shaqo aad u adag.
They had no time.	Wax wakhti ah ma ay helin.
How hard it is to really tell this to someone else.	Sidee u adag tahay in run ahaantii tan qof kale loo sheego.
They live together and live together.	Waa la wada nool yahay oo wada nool yihiin.
And so on.	Iyo wax la mid ah.
That's how it was.	Taasi waa sida ay ahayd.
I am just a man.	Waxaan ahay nin kaliya.
This will not do.	Tani ma yeeli doonto.
It was a good time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti fiican.
Not sure what the former is.	Ma hubo waxa kan hore yahay.
No one will give me a job anymore.	Qofna mar dambe shaqo i siin maayo.
Maybe someone can help me with this.	Ma laga yaabaa in qof iga caawiyo arrintan.
Can't help.	Lama caawin karo.
He looked at me.	Aniga ayaa iga eegay.
It was good, but not great.	Waxay ahayd wanaagsan, laakiin ma weyn.
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
In fact, it can be devastating.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xun.
In fact, she did.	Runtii, way samaysay.
This was done in a very short time.	Taas waxa lagu sameeyay wakhti aad u yar.
This if too much of a problem.	Tani haddii ay aad u badan tahay dhibaato.
There was a lot here.	Halkan waxaa jiray wax badan.
What a bad day!	Waa maxay maalin xun!
It's all old, now.	Dhammaan waa hore, hadda.
Everything is left out.	Wax walba waa laga tagay.
I knew he was in trouble.	Waan ogaa inuu dhib qabo.
Take one.	Mid qaado.
See you soon!	Dhawaan arag!
Not really so surprising.	Runtii sidaas la yaab ma leh.
She could not leave.	Way bixi wayday.
Many other things as well.	Waxyaabo kale oo badan sidoo kale.
I thought it was you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay adiga tahay.
I will stay and.	waan joogi doonaa iyo.
He wanted to be taken.	Wuxuu rabay in la qaado.
Now, he is definitely gone.	Hadda, hubaal wuu baxay.
I got that from you	Taas adiga ayaan kaa helay
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqada aado
She did not say why.	Ma aysan sheegin sababta.
He was very surprised and could not speak.	Aad buu ula yaabay oo wuu hadli waayay.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
Let him do what he needs to do.	Ha sameeyo wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu sameeyo.
Really, really bad.	Runtii, runtii aad u xun.
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
At home, at school.	Guriga, dugsiga.
I don't want to be there	Ma rabo inaan halkaas joogo
He is too tall for me.	Aad buu iga dheer yahay.
This is new.	Tani waa mid cusub.
I fell for it.	Waan ku dhacay.
There really is.	Dhab ahaantii waxaa jira.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
She was always busy.	Had iyo jeer mashquul bay ahayd.
Who really loves who you are.	Yaa runtii ku jecel qofka aad tahay.
For me, that has everything.	Aniga ahaan, taasi waxay leedahay wax walba.
It was not something they had to do.	Ma ahayn wax ay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I hope you do the same !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso!.
That will take time.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
I was in the room.	Qolka ayaan ku jiray.
I could no longer do it.	Mar dambe ma aan samayn karin.
Certainly not what they want.	Dhab ahaantii waxa aanay rabin.
He would not say how.	Ma uu odhan lahaa sida.
I do not do that.	Taas ma sameeyo.
Maybe she does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sameyso.
I was there.	Halkaas ayaan u joogay.
He began to eat.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu wax cuno.
You can get what you want there.	Waxaad halkaas ka heli kartaa waxaad rabto.
It was good.	Wanaagsan bay ahayd.
It was like.	Waxay ahayd sida.
But they are good.	Laakiin way fiican yihiin.
But don't tell me.	Laakiin ha ii sheegin.
Great place.	Meel weyn.
Don't leave me.	Ha iga tagin.
It wasn’t when he came back now.	Ma ahayn markii uu hadda soo noqday.
He did not want her to know.	Ma uu doonayn in ay ogaato.
So maybe.	Sidaas laga yaabaa.
There is nothing better than that.	Ma jirto si ka fiican taas.
He would have had a chance.	Wuxuu fursad u heli lahaa.
It was a very long time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u dheer.
I have not seen it yet.	Wali ma arag.
You can find it here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
This can be so.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa sidaas.
You must not tell anyone.	Waa inaadan cidna u sheegin.
I heard it was very good.	Waxaan maqlay inay aad u fiican tahay.
After a while he became a man.	Muddo ka dib wuxuu noqday nin.
It was a strike.	Waxay ahayd shaqo joojin.
Not really sure how to do that.	Runtii ma hubo sida taas loo sameeyo.
Now she has not spoken.	Hadda ma aysan hadlin.
Including making.	Oo ay ku jiraan samaynta.
That is very good.	Taasi waa mid aad u fiican.
John must leave.	John waa inuu baxo.
But, there is more.	Laakiin, waxaa jira wax ka badan.
I felt him go.	Waxaan dareemay inuu tago.
He could not leave.	Ma uu ka bixi waayay.
He looked at nothing.	Waxba wuu iska eegay.
It was a lie.	Been bay ahayd.
I am really happy	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
Not too much.	Aad uma badna.
That is the best.	Taasi waa waxa ugu fiican.
This was really true for me.	Runtii tani run bay ii ahayd.
That is why they need it.	Taasi waa sababta ay ugu baahan yihiin.
Not all, maybe.	Dhammaan ma aha, malaha.
Can't talk	Lama hadli karo
I made money	Lacag baan sameeyay
Something bad happened.	Wax xun baa dhacay.
He could not, it was not as he could.	Ma awoodin, ma ahayn sida uu awoodo.
I want to talk to you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa hadlo.
He had nothing to say.	Wax uu u sheego ma uu haysan.
Still, nothing.	Weli, waxba kuma jiraan.
I wish she was still here.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay weli halkan joogto.
It is like that, but not for you.	Waa sidaas oo kale, laakiin adiga maaha.
But she refused.	Laakiin way diiday.
That’s the only place I have.	Taasi waa meesha kaliya ee aan leeyahay.
But he never came back.	Laakiin mar dambe ma soo noqon.
I did not take a chance	fursad maan qaadan
I think that's a bit lucky.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay xoogaa nasiib ah.
It really needs a good time.	Runtii waxay u baahan tahay wakhti fiican.
But first of all.	Laakiin marka hore wax walba.
None of us knew what was going on.	Mid naga mid ah ma garanayn waxa socda.
He said something obvious.	Wuxuu sheegay wax iska cad.
I was not ready to go.	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan tago.
She is better than me.	Way iga fiican tahay aniga.
Maybe this was it.	Malaha tani waxay ahayd.
I do not want to go there	Ma rabo inaan aado halkaas
You do not have to eat much.	Ma aha inaad wax badan cunto.
Why so many.	Maxay u badan yihiin.
She was a person.	Waxay ahayd qof.
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma helin.
are you still	weli ma tahay.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
I don't know what it will be like.	Ma garanayo sida ay noqon doonto.
He is ready to see you.	Wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu ku arko.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
Not true.	Run maaha.
I want it all.	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan.
I'm sure you would do the same.	Waxaan hubaa inaad samayn lahayd wax la mid ah.
Maybe he has too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale haysto.
But he left.	Laakiin wuu ka baxay.
It's not a bad place.	Ma ahan meel aad u xun.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
He couldn't believe it.	Wuu rumaysan waayay inuu sidaas yidhi.
Nothing came in.	Wax soo galay ma jirin.
I can see why she likes it.	Waan arki karaa sababta ay u jeceshahay.
It will be interesting to see.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh in la arko.
Said but good.	U sheegay laakiin wanaagsan.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
They are good at it.	Way ku fiican yihiin.
all over here.	halkan oo dhan joogay.
But obviously you are a beautiful person.	Laakiin sida cad waxaad tahay qof qurux badan.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
This is given.	Tani waa la siiyay.
Only owned.	Kaliya iska leh.
I can see them all	Waan wada arki karaa
I would definitely be there again.	Hubaal halkaas mar kale ayaan joogi lahaa.
That is now true.	Taasi hadda waa run.
He is a bad man.	Waa nin xun.
I really know a man.	Runtii waan garanayaa nin.
I will do it for you	Adiga ayaan kaa yeeli doonaa
He now lives in a prison cell.	Hadda waxa uu ku nool yahay qolka xabsiga.
It is still a lie.	Wali waa been.
I do not need you.	kuma rabo.
You are one.	Mid baad tahay.
It was too early for this.	Waxay ahayd goor hore tan.
He wanted to know why.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado sababta.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Everyone now knows.	Qof walba hadda wuu garanayaa.
Tomorrow will be another difficult day.	Berrito waxay ahaan lahayd maalin kale oo adag.
Sure you look like one now.	Hubaal waxaad u egtahay mid hadda.
It's really great.	Runtii aad bay u weyn tahay.
Long ago.	Waqti dheer ka hor hadda.
In fact, he always had.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu had iyo jeer lahaa.
But no one really wants that.	Laakiin qofna runtii taas ma rabo.
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
I can't believe she did this to me.	Ma rumaysan karo inay tan igu samaysay.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Which we certainly do not.	Taas oo hubaal aanu samayn.
I had this.	Waxaan lahaa tan.
I had never done that before.	Weligay taas ka hor ma samayn.
The right person.	Qof sax ah.
He has done it before.	Hore ayuu u sameeyay.
Now you can do it	Hadda waad samayn kartaa
I will come closer	waan u dhawaan doonaa
I’ve got a lot to feel right now.	Waxaan helay wax badan oo aan dareemayo hadda.
I could not agree	Ma ogolaan karin
Do not leave.	Ha ka tagin.
I'm sure you can	Waan hubaa inaad samayn karto
He seemed familiar.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid la yaqaan.
Whenever he had a chance, he would take it.	Mar kasta oo uu fursad u helo, wuu qaadan jiray.
It is beautiful here.	Way qurux badan tahay halkan.
If you are young	In ka yar
They may not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan samayn.
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid cad.
We had to do it again.	Waxay ahayd inaan mar kale samayno.
I'm sure it is.	Waan hubaa inay tahay.
It was for me.	Waxay ii ahayd aniga.
I think every man has one.	Waxaan qabaa in nin walba uu leeyahay mid.
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegin.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah malaha.
I'm not sure if that is true.	Ma hubo inay taasi run tahay.
He did that.	Taas wuu sameeyay.
They are so bad.	Aad bay u xun yihiin.
They are not included	Kuma jiraan
There is no urgency here.	Halkan wax degdeg ah kuma jiro.
They are unlikely to be more.	Uma badna inay ka badan yihiin.
But it can't help.	Laakiin ma caawin karto.
If it did, we would love it.	Haddii ay dhici lahayd, waan jeclaan lahayn.
For one thing, you may not believe me.	Mid ka mid ah, waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan i rumaysan.
It can happen	Way dhici kartaa
I can't talk to him.	Ma la hadli karo isaga.
It was good.	Waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
Anyone can grow up.	Qof kastaa wuu weyn karaa.
Is it me? 	Ma aniga baa?
But not only this.	Laakiin ma aha oo kaliya tan.
He is not a man.	Ma aha nin.
I will not tell anyone who you are.	Qofna u sheegi maayo qofka aad tahay.
He did it badly.	Si xun buu u sameeyay.
There is no time now.	Waqti ma jiro hadda.
And there is no such time now.	Oo ma jiro waqti la mid ah hadda.
That’s how everyone feels at first.	Taasi waa sida qof walba dareemayo marka hore.
what would you do	maxaad samayn lahayd
This is what will happen to us.	Tani waa waxa nagu dhici doona.
But it is not true, it is not anymore.	Laakiin run maaha, mar dambe maaha.
You can stay here until someone finds it.	Halkan ayaad joogi kartaa ilaa qof ka helo.
It will go.	Way tagi doontaa.
But this should not be surprising.	Laakiin tani waa inaysan noqon mid la yaab leh.
No one wanted to do that.	Qofna ma doonayn inuu taas sameeyo.
That is the same.	Taas ayaa la mid ah.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Wax xun ma jirin.
You can do many things.	Waxaad samayn kartaa waxyaabo badan.
But don't tell me.	Laakiin ha ii sheegin.
I told him so.	Waxaan u sheegay sidaas.
Surprisingly not all friends.	Yaab leh oo aan wada saaxiib ahayn.
There was nothing	Ma jirin wax
The reason for this is obvious.	Sababta tani waa wax iska cad.
I have friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo.
Someone else.	Qof kale.
I just left	Kaliya waan ka tagay
She said she did not.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay lahayn.
No one said anything good.	Qofna wax wanaagsan ma odhan.
You do not need to know.	Uma baahnid inaad ogaato.
You are an adult.	Waxaad tahay qof weyn.
You can do it again.	Mar kale ayaad samayn kartaa.
This is only one.	Tani waa hal kaliya.
He should not have been here.	Ma ahayn inuu halkan joogo.
She had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inuu sameeyo.
And let me pick it up here.	Oo aan halkan ka soo qaado.
Nothing will be better.	Waxba way ka fiicnaan doonaan.
He told me time and time again.	Mar iyo waqti ayuu ii sheegay.
There is something here.	Wax baa jira halkan.
That was not a problem.	Taasi dhib ma ahayn.
Maybe he has.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu haysto.
Really, really good.	Dhab ahaantii, runtii fiican.
You can't see me.	I arki wayday.
Also take time.	Sidoo kale waqti qaado.
He would do all the work.	Shaqada oo dhan wuu qaban lahaa.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I tried to go.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan tago.
The only thing is.	Waxa kaliya ayaa ah.
He decided to leave.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu baxo.
There are good things.	Waxyaabo wanaagsan ayaa jira.
I know this is small.	Waan ogahay in tani ay yar tahay.
I wanted to know who found him.	Waxaan rabay inuu ogaado qof helay isaga.
I wanted something else.	Wax kale ayaan rabay.
I would like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa.
I started to see it better.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan si ka sii fiican u arko.
For me, this has always been a problem.	Aniga ahaan, tani had iyo jeer waxay ahayd dhibaato.
But don't tell me what you can do.	Laakiin ha ii sheegin waxaad samayn karto.
Everything is fine.	Wax walba wuu ku fiican yahay.
You again.	Waxaad mar kale.
It will take some time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa xoogaa waqti ah.
I can't do anything right now.	Wax sax ah maan qaban karin hadda.
Maybe very little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u yar.
Hard, really.	Mid adag, dhab ahaantii.
Both are very good.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin.
He must clearly own a car.	Waa inuu si cad u leeyahay baabuur.
He should have stayed in prison.	Waxay ahayd inuu xabsiga ku sii jiro.
You are better than this.	Waad ka fiican tahay tan.
Not too much.	Aad uma badna.
That is a thing.	Taasi waa wax.
It came out.	Waxaa soo baxay.
i can love you	waan ku jeclaan karaa
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
There is nothing else to talk about.	Wax kale oo laga hadlo ma jirto.
I really like it	Runtii waan jeclahay
I don't care.	Aniga waxba igama hayo.
Like me.	Aniga ila mid ah.
Where he knew she was.	Meesha uu ku ogaa inay joogto.
I did not understand anything.	waxba ma fahmin.
If it is too good to be true, it probably is.	Haddii ay aad u wanaagsan tahay in run la noqdo, waxay u badan tahay.
I can be more, you can be better.	Waxaan noqon karaa wax badan, ka fiicnaan kartaa.
Very bad place.	Meel aad u xun.
Mostly very beautiful.	Inta badan aad u qurux badan.
Now that is not a bad idea.	Hadda taasi fikrad xun maaha.
Everything that happened was something else.	Wax kasta oo dhacay ayaa ahaa wax kale.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan in la sameeyo.
That's how it was done.	Sidaas ayaa loo sameeyay.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
It’s like everything.	Waa sida wax walba.
She was right.	Sax bay ahayd.
Probably not.	Malaha ma uusan ahayn.
We are one.	Mid baan nahay.
There was more.	Waxaa jiray in ka badan.
I still do not understand what happened.	Wali ma fahmin waxa dhacay.
I'm sure it was him.	Waan hubaa inuu isaga ahaa.
He refused to help.	Wuu diiday inuu caawiyo.
He probably did.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu sameeyay.
Now pick him up.	Hadda soo qaado isaga.
There is no problem.	Dhibaato ma jiraan.
I did not lie	been ma sheegin
But, that really isn’t much.	Laakiin, taasi runtii maaha wax badan.
I always talked to him.	Mar walba waan la hadli jiray.
I heard nearby.	Waxaan maqlay dhow.
You can't do anything.	Wax ma qaban kartid.
One made.	Mid la sameeyay.
That must have been great.	Taasi waa inay ahayd mid weyn.
I did not know where he was.	Meel uu joogo maan garanayn.
Maybe he was.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ahaa.
I need it.	Waan u baahanahay.
After all, it is not.	Taas ka dib, ma aha.
They are very difficult.	Aad bay u adag yihiin.
They will still happen.	Weli way dhici doonaan.
The same may be said here.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa laga yaabaa in halkan laga sheego.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
She loves you.	Way ku jeceshahay.
There is a lot to do and say.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo oo la sheego.
Not interesting enough.	Ma aha mid xiiso leh oo ku filan.
I think he is, a bit.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu yahay, xoogaa.
I need to be with you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula joogo
That's it.	Waa tan.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
Otherwise, let him know where.	Haddii kale, ha ogaato meesha.
I can tell you whatever it is.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa wax kasta oo ay tahay.
He did well too.	Si fiican ayuu u sameeyay sidoo kale.
It still is.	Wali waa.
Not so much.	Ma aha sidaas u badan.
Only, not the best.	Kaliya, maaha kan ugu fiican.
Not like anything else out there.	Ma aha sida wax kale oo halkaas ka jira.
Would you believe he wanted to see how it was.	Ma rumaysan lahayd inuu doonayo inuu arko sida ay tahay.
This cannot be.	Tani ma noqon karto.
Not too hard again.	Ma dhib badan mar kale.
It may also be so here.	Waxa kale oo laga yaabaa inay sidaas tahay halkan.
I am really happy about this.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
I think that's a bad thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax xun.
Good food, too.	Cunto wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
Not sure exactly.	Ma hubo si sax ah.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
For you and me, it can still happen.	Aniga iyo adiga, wali way dhici kartaa.
Just the same.	Kaliya isku mid.
I told him again.	Mar kale ayaan u sheegay.
He told me once it would not be a problem.	Wuxuu ii sheegay hal mar dhib ma ahaan doono.
Of course, this is not the case.	Dhab ahaantii, tani sidaas maaha.
Doing the right thing.	Samaynta wax sax ah.
No one likes it.	Qofna ma jecla.
Quick and fun.	Degdeg ah oo xiiso leh.
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
Here is the idea.	Waa kan fikrad.
Today, it is different.	Maanta, waa si kale.
I don't know if it was or not.	Ma garanayo inuu ahaa iyo in kale.
I do not want to go.	Ma rabo inaan tago.
He has to study.	Waa inuu wax barto.
She loves it.	Way jeceshahay.
Not much else.	Wax badan oo kale maaha.
But it is more, more so.	Laakiin way ka sii badan tahay, wax ka badan.
That is the most difficult thing.	Taasi waa waxa aad u adag.
Take this.	Qaado tan.
We may not get it, once.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan heli lahayn, hal mar.
Here it is.	Halkan waa.
Same here.	Si la mid ah halkan.
It took a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaa qaatay.
He went out to talk to her.	Wuu u baxay si uu ula hadlo.
I don't know what that will be.	Ma garanayo waxa ay taasi noqon doonto.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
It’s a little bit different.	Waa wax yar oo yar.
There is nothing in him.	Ma jiro wax isaga ku jira.
He tried to say something.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu wax sheego.
She has to go to work every day.	Waa inay maalin walba shaqo aado.
Not if you do not want to.	Ma aha haddii aadan rabin.
At home as well.	Guriga sidoo kale.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
I still have to work.	Wali waa inaan shaqeeyo.
I love that for him.	Taas waan ku jeclahay isaga.
I know, but.	Waan ogahay, laakiin.
That was tough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
That is for sure.	Taas wuu hubaa.
I was, really.	Waxaan ahaa, runtii.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
It was very fast.	Aad bay degdeg u ahayd.
But it was not a car.	Laakiin ma ahayn baabuur.
I can't find a place here	Ma heli karaa meel halkan
I can't see clearly.	Si cad uma arki karo.
So far, I have not paid.	Ilaa hadda, ma bixin wax lacag ah.
But he could not, yet.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay, weli.
Can't see what's going on here?	Miyaadan arki karin waxa halkan ka socda?
Yesterday was amazing.	Shalay waxay ahayd yaab.
That was rejected.	Taasi waa la diiday.
It's not just about talking here.	Kaliya maaha in halkan laga hadlo.
But this was something bigger.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd wax ka weyn.
Definitely a bit.	Dhab ahaantii xoogaa.
Probably not.	Malaha ma aysan lahayn.
I need to tell you again.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan mar kale kuu sheego.
I just did not see it.	Kaliya ma arag.
Let everyone know.	Qof walba ha ogaado.
I don't know who you are.	Ma garanayo qofka aad tahay.
But it is amazing.	Laakiin waa yaab.
I would love him.	Waan jeclaan lahaa isaga.
It will not hurt anymore.	Dhib dambe ma yeeli doono.
You can do this ahead of time.	Waxaad samayn kartaa tan wakhti ka hor.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
But what she told me was enough.	Laakiin waxa ay ii sheegtay ayaa igu filan.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.	Ma garanayo waxa berri dhici doona.
He told me he would not be at home for a while.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aanu guriga joogi doonin in muddo ah.
I am not present.	Anigu hadda ma joogo.
She probably had.	Waxay u badan tahay inay lahayd.
Out of place.	Ka baxay meel.
They just do nothing.	Kaliya waxba ma sameeyaan.
It is something that has left me.	Waxay ii tahay wax iga tagay.
I was there to help.	Ma u joogay si uu u caawiyo.
It can be found here.	Waxaa laga heli karaa halkan.
No one wanted to know.	Qofna ma rabin inuu wax ogaado.
And just not.	Oo kaliya maaha.
He is a true friend.	Waa saaxiib run ah.
What was, is better.	Maxaa ahaa, ayaa ka fiican.
I don't want anyone to know.	Ma rabo in qofna ogaado.
It's obvious.	Waa wax iska cad runtii.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
You know this is the best.	Waad ogtahay in tani ay ugu fiican tahay.
I don't think it's good.	Uma maleynayo inay wanaagsan tahay.
Everyone to him.	Qof walba isaga.
When he felt good enough enough time.	Markii uu dareemay fiicnaan ayaa ku filan waqti ku filan.
There really is no such thing as a good job.	Runtii shaqo aad u wanaagsan ma jirto.
It would give me time.	Waxay i siin lahayd waqti.
He was a great man everywhere.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u weyn meel walba.
Now a lot is felt.	Hadda wax badan baa la dareemay.
I was just not ready to tell him everything.	Kaliya diyaar uma ahayn inaan wax walba u sheego.
He does not have to say much.	Ma aha inuu wax badan sheego.
Why you.	Waa maxay sababta aad.
All day long.	Maalin dhan.
But he has not been able, so far.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay, ilaa hadda.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
He said firmly.	Si adag ayuu u yidhi.
This will be done tomorrow.	Tani waa la qaban doonaa berri.
Can someone please help me?	Qof fadlan ma i caawin karaa?.
All a few years older than you, but not much.	Dhammaan dhowr sano ayaa kaa weyn, laakiin ma badna.
I have several new ones.	Waxaan hayaa dhowr cusub.
There was this.	Waxaa jiray tan.
Once is enough.	Mar baa ku filan.
If they are, great.	Haddii ay yihiin, weyn.
She should have known that.	Waxay ahayd inay taas ogaato.
Maybe I should.	Malaha waa inaan.
I would like you to do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad taas sameyso.
A very good person.	Qof aad u wanaagsan.
I'm really sorry, but.	Runtii waan ka xumahay, laakiin.
catch you !.	ku qabo!.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
But now.	Laakiin hadda.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u dhow.
It is not beautiful.	Ma qurux badna.
It was not so great.	Ma ahayn sidaas u weyn.
I would not do the same.	Ma samayn lahaa wax la mid ah.
I did not know.	Maan garanayn.
It was a great idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad fiican.
I would like to do more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan sameeyo.
I would love to do the same again.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan dib u sameeyo wax la mid ah.
He felt something.	Wax buu dareemay.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
You will come back later.	Mar dambe ayaad soo noqon doontaa.
Now, everyone knows.	Hadda, qof kastaa wuu garanayaa.
I did not know how.	Maan garanayn sida.
She knew it was a lie.	Waxay ogaatay inay been tahay.
I wondered how he did it.	Waxaan la yaabay sida uu u sameeyay.
He never had.	Waligiis ma lahayn.
This is unknown.	Tan lama garanayo.
But there must be something.	Laakiin waa in ay wax jiraan.
That can tell us something.	Taasi waxay noo sheegi kartaa wax.
Maybe he would.	Malaha wuu yeeli lahaa.
No matter what she wants.	Dhib malaha waxay rabto.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
They do not make money.	Lacag ma sameeyaan.
He became a very interesting person.	Waxa uu noqday qof aad u xiiso badan.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I wanted to know how it was.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sida ay tahay.
Beautiful day.	Maalin qurux badan.
Now, enough is enough.	Hadda, ku filan ayaa ku filan.
I liked it, he said.	Waan ka helay, ayuu yidhi.
I have never told anyone this.	Weligay cidna uma sheegin tan.
Don't talk like that.	Ha u hadlin sidaas.
Has he ever been.	Miyuu waligiis.
That is for sure now.	Taasi hadda waa hubaal.
I know nothing can happen to you.	Waan ogahay in aanay waxba kugu dhici karin.
That would be good.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd mid wanaagsan.
What again?	Waa maxay mar kale?
I am a lot more real.	Waxaan ahay wax badan oo dhab ah.
It's more fun.	Way ka sii xiiso badan.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
You are very smart about that.	Aad baad u caqli badan tahay taas.
Why, why, why.	Sababta, sababta, sababta.
I was not a little surprised.	Anigu ma yara yaabay.
You can tell it is true.	Waxaad u sheegi kartaa inay run tahay.
It has been heard.	Waa la maqlay.
That is not always true.	Taasi mar walba run maaha.
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
I do.	Waan sameeyaa.
There was nothing that she did to cause it.	Wax ay samaysay ma jirin wax sax ah oo ay samaysay.
That is not what I think.	Taasi ma aha waxa ay aniga ila tahay.
It is now the best home.	Hadda waa guriga ugu fiican.
I think it is very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u fiican tahay.
It may help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawiso.
I started talking to him.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la hadlo.
Do not speak negatively.	Si xun ha uga hadlin.
They said nothing.	Waxba uma ay sheegi jirin.
One, where you are.	Mid, meesha aad joogto.
It really is not like anything else.	Runtii maaha sida wax kale.
This was a huge problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhib aad u weyn.
If you are.	Haddii aad tahay.
I hope everyone works well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu si fiican u shaqeeyo.
More time.	Waqti badan.
He would not do that.	Ma uu yeeli lahaa taas.
There was something else as well.	Wax kale ayaa jiray sidoo kale.
This was obvious.	Tani waxay ahayd mid cad.
Now everyone has one.	Hadda qof kastaa mid buu leeyahay.
They were not present.	Ma ay joogin.
I did not want you to know that.	Ma rabin inaad taas ogaato.
you did not come.	ma aadan iman.
They may not really come back.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay dhab ahaan soo noqon.
As he knew they would be.	Sida uu ogaa inay ahaan doonaan.
And so on.	Oo ku sii socda.
And at home.	Iyo guriga.
It is a clear day!	Waa maalin cad!
Still, she could not believe it.	Weli, way rumaysan weyday.
No one is ready to speak.	Qofna diyaar uma aha inuu hadlo.
I lost	waan waayay
How true that is.	Sidee run u tahay taasi.
I told him that.	Taas ayaan u sheegay.
I think it will not happen.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaysan dhici doonin.
Not that big car either.	Ma aha in baabuur weyn sidoo kale.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa sidaas oo kale.
He did not speak.	Ma uusan hadlin.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
you are a great man.	nin weyn baad tahay.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
She doesn't have to say anything.	Ma aha inay wax sheegto.
Same as it is now.	La mid ah sida ay hadda tahay.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
I can help you	Waan ku caawin karaa
There is no prior appointment.	Ma jiro ballan hore.
Very good man.	Nin aad u fiican.
Obviously this is true.	Sida iska cad tani waa run.
Certainly not for everyone.	Dhab ahaantii uma aha qof walba.
I don't think you are, you know.	Uma maleynayo inaad tahay, waad ogtahay.
Three of them are now unemployed.	Saddex ka mid ah hadda waa shaqo la'aan.
Very well done.	Aad ayaa loo sameeyay.
I felt like a new man.	Waxaan dareemay sidii nin cusub.
One could not be found.	Waa la heli waayay mid.
Take it with you	Adiga qaado
He wondered if it was true.	Waxa uu is waydiiyay in ay run tahay.
But clearly not.	Laakiin si cad maaha.
He spent a lot of money.	Lacag aad u badan buu la baxay.
Nothing came of it.	Waxba uma soo bixin.
Maybe he would be fine.	Malaha wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
I know you are.	Waan ogahay inaad tahay.
I do not want to do this.	Ma doonayo inaan tan sameeyo.
Now I have a job	Hadda waxaan hayaa shaqo
I was surprised by that.	Waxaan la yaabay taas.
As you were.	Sida aad ahayd.
I'll just leave	Kaliya waan bixi doonaa
I will see you.	waan ku arki doonaa.
He could not get there well.	Halkaas si fiican ayuu ugu tagi waayay.
Great idea.	Fikrad aad u fiican.
I am here now	hadda waan joogaa
Tomorrow, I will break up.	Berri, waan kala tagi doonaa.
He is a real, real man.	Waa dhab, nin dhab ah.
She is bigger now.	Hadda way ka weyn tahay.
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
It just isn’t as close as it should be.	Kaliya maaha meel u dhow sida wanaagsan.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
You would be if you were there.	Waad ahaan lahayd haddii aad halkaas joogi lahayd.
That was a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
That was what she thought.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ay la tahay.
But no one here.	Laakiin halkan ma jiro qof.
I decided to eat a meal.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan cuno cunto.
No one can help please.	Qofna ma caawin karaa fadlan.
But that was great if.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid weyn haddii.
That she can do it.	In ay samayn karto.
Don't tell me.	Ha ii sheegin.
Really amazing.	Runtii runtii yaab.
He really wanted to go.	Aad buu u rabay inuu tago.
There is so much more.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa jira.
She loves it.	Aad bay u jeceshahay.
He knew.	Wuu ka ogaa.
I really want this.	Runtii tan ayaan rabaa.
I just got it.	hadda waan helay.
And time with old friends.	Iyo wakhti saaxiibo hore.
It seems obvious to me.	Wuxuu ii muuqdaa mid cad.
There is no time to do anything.	Ma jiro wakhti wax lagu sameeyo.
Soon you will get it.	In yar ka dib waad heli doontaa.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
It is too long	Aad bay u dheer tahay
I didn't think it was right.	Uma malaynayn inay sax ahayd.
He knew what to do.	Wuu ogaa waxa ay samayn lahayd.
That may not be true.	Taasi waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan run ahayn.
And because he was still.	Iyo sababta oo ah wuxuu weli ahaa.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
That must be difficult.	Taasi waa inay adag tahay.
It was another great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin kale oo aad u wanaagsan.
As he heard things.	Sidii uu wax u maqlay.
No one will help me.	Qofna ima caawin doono.
There was a man at the door.	albaabka waxaa joogay qof.
He could not take more.	Waxa uu qaadan waayay in ka badan.
I can't even speak.	Xitaa ma hadli karo.
Almost everyone had it.	Inta badan qof kastaa wuu lahaa.
You are a lucky man.	nin nasiib badan baad tahay.
I was really surprised to see you.	Runtii waan la yaabay inaan ku arko.
Really interesting.	Runtii aad u xiiso badan.
There is a door.	Waxaa jira albaabka.
He saw me.	Wuu i arkay.
This sounds familiar.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
I did not understand what was going on.	Maan fahmin waxa socda.
I know what you are doing.	Waan ogahay waxaad samaynayso.
It is longer for us.	Way noo sii dheer tahay.
She had no idea what she was up to.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan waxa ay u joogto.
They are so big, so beautiful.	Aad bay u weyn yihiin, aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
They really don’t.	Runtii ma sameeyaan.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
it can stay.	way joogi kartaa .
What the least.	Maxaa ugu yar.
I am a great man.	Waxaan ahay nin weyn.
See you here	Halkaan ku arag
I have been in it for a long time.	Waxaan ku jiraa muddo dheer.
I will never see much.	Weligay wax badan ma arki doono.
Don't tell others.	Dib ha u sheegin dadka kale.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
This was really.	Tani waxay ahayd run ahaantii.
As well.	Iyo sidoo kale.
Maybe a little while ago.	Malaha wax yar ka hor.
I can do this.	Waan samayn karaa tan.
But we did not stop.	Laakiin ma aanu joojin.
I think everyone is fine.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba uu fiican yahay.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
We will tell you what you want to know.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxaad rabto inaad ogaato.
It is not yet gone.	Ilaa hadda lama tagin.
No one came out.	Qofna ma soo bixin.
I was a man.	Waxaan ahaa nin.
This did not take very long.	Tani ma qaadan waqti aad u dheer.
There are no problems to this day	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan ilaa maanta
However difficult that is.	Si kasta oo ay taasi u dhib badan tahay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
It was so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas.
I think it is very beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
Everyone knows you have to do it.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay inaad sameyso.
He was there to study.	Wuxuu u joogay inuu wax barto.
This can be interesting.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid xiiso leh.
More, not all.	In ka badan, ma dhammaan.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
You can't do that.	Ma samayn kartid sidaas.
I don't see it any other way.	Si kale uma arko.
It is real to me.	Waa ii dhab.
That will never happen again.	Taasi mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
Not much will be seen.	Wax badan la arki maayo.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma i caawin karaa?.
I have to know what is going on here.	Waa inaan ogaado waxa halkan ka socda.
It will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doonto.
I wanted to.	Waan rabay.
That was long.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid dheer.
But then, there is no problem.	Laakiin ka dib, wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
Hard work would see that.	Shaqo adag baa taas arki lahaa.
Not a little.	Wax yar ma aha.
I really don't want to do anything other than this.	Runtii ma rabo inaan sameeyo wax aan tan ahayn.
It does not end there.	Halkaas kuma dhammaan karto.
I hope it helps.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
But he never got a chance.	Laakiin waligiis fursad ma helin.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha inaad.
I just have to learn from it.	Kaliya waa inaan wax ka barto.
This is also not a coincidence.	Tani sidoo kale ma ahan wax iska dhacay.
I know more than you.	Waan ogahay in ka badan adiga.
They will get better.	Way fiicnaan doonaan.
Still, it's amazing.	Weli, waa yaab.
He would love this.	Wuu jeclaan lahaa tan.
He thought he was ready.	Wuxuu mooday inuu diyaar u yahay.
Everyone knows that.	Qof walba waa ogyahay taas.
Otherwise, we do nothing.	Haddii kale, waxba ma samayno.
Everyone,.	Qof kasta,.
I found it interesting here.	Dhib xiiso leh ayaa halkan ka helay.
I say so is true.	Waxaan sidaas u leeyahay waa run.
Here is what you need to know.	Waa kan waxa aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
Keep everyone busy.	Qof walba ku mashquul.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
He did not come very far.	Aad uma uu iman.
He decided to stay.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu sii joogo.
She realized she wasn't.	Way ogaatay inaysan ahayn.
I do not know how often.	Ma garanayo inta jeer.
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
She knew it would not be.	Way ogaatay in aanay ahaan doonin.
I am very happy with how we are.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay sida aan nahay.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo.
Obviously not the same.	Sida iska cad isku mid maaha.
He is very sure of that.	Aad ayuu ugu hubaa taas.
He was a very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u fiican.
This is the only thing that is close to working for me so far.	Tani waa waxa kaliya ee u dhow inaan u shaqeeyo ilaa hadda.
It is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
He was always a friend.	Mar walba saaxiib buu ahaa.
I never had.	Weligay maan haysan.
Do not give me anything.	Waxba ha i siin.
You can not find it.	Ma heli kartid.
I don’t even think anyone noticed.	Xitaa uma maleynayo in qofna dareemay.
I went	Waa baxay
Surely someone would see it.	Hubaal qof baa arki lahaa.
Only one person did this.	Hal qof oo kaliya ayaa tan sameeyay.
He was a young man.	Nin yar buu ahaa.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
He was.	Wuxuu ahaa.
I do not know what you will do.	Ma garanayo waxaad samayn doonto.
One is much bigger than the other.	Mid aad uga weyn kan kale.
He looked at you.	Wuu ku eegay.
Nothing to say.	Wax la sheego ma jiro.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
Here is the one here.	Waa kan mid ka mid ah halkan.
Probably not.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan samayn doonin.
You can't have a good time.	Waqti fiican ma aad sameyn kartid.
I am very sure.	Aad ayaan u hubaa.
I wonder about that.	Waxaan la yaabanahay taas .
He got it.	Wuu helay.
Everyone is happy.	Qof kastaa wuu faraxsan yahay.
That is not a promise we can make.	Taasi ma ahan ballan aan sameyn karno.
This is nothing new.	Tani maaha wax cusub.
I just don't see that.	Kaliya taas ma arko.
But this one time.	Laakiin tani hal mar.
It always has been.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd.
How can this be?	Sidee tani u noqon kartaa?
I just want to help you.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo.
What was so difficult?	Muxuu ahaa mid aad u adag?
Can I do it? 	Ma samayn karaa?
Friend is really good.	Saaxiib runtii waa wanaagsan yahay.
You had to let me know.	Waxay ahayd inaad ii soo sheegto.
I have no idea what is coming, really not.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxa soo socda, run ahaantii maaha.
If he is.	Haddii uu yahay.
There is no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
It doesn't look right	Wax sax ah uma eka
I did not believe him.	Maan rumaysan isaga.
No one was ready.	Qofna diyaar uma ahayn.
I do not know that.	Ma garanayo taas.
Give a little.	Wax yar sii.
I know you love him.	Waan ogahay inaad jeceshahay isaga .
That sounds pretty good.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
He is very smart	Waa caqli badan
Not surprisingly.	Ma aha wax la yaab leh.
I know you should have done it.	Waan ogahay inay ahayd inaad sameyso.
We are very happy to be friends.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan nahay saaxiibo.
Anyway popular.	Si kasta oo loo jecel yahay.
There are many good things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan.
I thought we were close friends.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan nahay saaxiibo dhow.
It sounds like an appointment.	Waxay u egtahay ballan.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
This was another lie.	Tani waxay ahayd been kale.
Give as much time as you need.	Sii wakhti inta aad u baahan tahay.
I would see	waan arki lahaa
And not much time.	Oo ma jiro waqti badan.
This more and more.	Tani wax badan iyo wax ka badan.
He likes to do that.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu taas sameeyo.
We would do it again.	Mar kale ayaan samayn lahayn.
This may be the best way to do it.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa sida ugu wanaagsan ee loo sameeyo.
You are much worse.	Adiga ayaa aad uga xun.
Not at work, not at home.	Ma aha shaqada, ma aha guriga.
It's hard work.	Waa shaqo adag.
They must not have come yet.	Waa in aanay wali iman.
I hope to see you there !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaas kugu arko!.
Probably still.	Malaha weli waa.
He doesn't have to say much about it.	Ma aha in uu waligiis wax badan ka sheegay.
No and nowhere else.	Ma jiro iyo meel kale.
He said he had no idea.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu wax fikrad ah ka haysan.
It was amazing, really.	Waxay ahayd yaab, run ahaantii.
But still a bit fast.	Laakiin weli xoogaa degdeg ah.
No one told what was going on.	Qofna uma sheegin waxa socda.
I have no idea where we live now.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo halka aan hadda ku nool nahay.
I wanted to do it now.	Waxaan rabay inaan hadda sameeyo.
Clearly, she did.	Si cad, way samaysay.
As much as you love me, he said.	Sida aad ii jeceshahay, ayuu ku yidhi.
You are too tall, he says.	Aad baad u dheer tahay, ayuu yidhi.
I need to do something about it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax ku sameeyo.
He was ready for anything.	Wax walba diyaar ayuu u ahaa.
That was the same for me yesterday.	Taasi waxay ila ahayd shalay oo kale.
I was made new	cusub baa la iga dhigay
I will not lie to you.	Been kuu sheegi maayo.
He wanted me to go.	Wuxuu rabay inaan tago.
It really was hard.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid adag.
You need that today.	Taas maanta ayaad u baahan tahay.
He could not.	Waa awoodi waayay.
I do not believe!	Maan rumaysan!
It is really a lie.	Runtii waa been.
Not since he left.	Ma aha tan iyo markii uu baxay.
A lot, really.	Wax badan, dhab ahaantii.
I can't stay here	Ma joogi karo halkan
Something happened, something happened, something happened.	Wax baa dhacay, dhacay, wax dhacay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
There is nothing you are happy about.	Ma jiro wax aad ku faraxsan tahay.
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
I will not do this.	Tan ku samayn maayo.
I know	waan garanayaa
This is beautiful.	Tani waa qurux.
He is so beautiful.	Aad ayuu u qurux badan yahay.
She would do it.	Way samayn lahayd.
Everyone is taken.	Qof walba waa la qaatay.
That's right.	Waa sax.
This is hard work.	Tani waa shaqo adag.
This can be a problem.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
No one is ever the same as the other.	Ma jiro qof waligiis la mid ah kan kale.
He is as good as a white man.	Wuxuu u fiican yahay sida nin cad.
Pick what you want.	Ka soo qaado waxa aad doonto.
He certainly did not know.	Waxa hubaal ah in aanu garanayn.
Sure, he said.	Hubaal, ayuu yidhi.
Just bad stuff.	Kaliya waxyaabo xun.
It will be good for me.	Way ii fiicnaan doontaa aniga.
That is so beautiful.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan.
Another tomorrow.	Mid kale berrito.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
I appeared.	Waxaan u muuqday.
She loves him very much.	Aad bay u jeceshahay isaga.
I do not want to know anything.	Ma rabo inaan wax ogaado.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
He does it well on his own.	Keligiis si fiican ayuu u sameeyaa.
But he started us.	Laakiin wuu nagu bilaabay.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
In fact, there was nothing new.	Dhab ahaantii, ma jirin wax cusub.
Enough is said.	Ku filan baa la yidhi.
She is always ready to help people.	Had iyo jeer waxay diyaar u tahay inay dadka caawiso.
I really should.	Runtii waa inaan.
You can not see	Ma aadan arki karin
It was so much more than that.	Waxay ahayd wax aad uga badan taas.
He went.	Wuu u tagay.
Would stay again	Mar kale joogi lahaa
Maybe that's mostly true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in inta badan taasi run tahay.
Now he had nothing to say.	Hadda ma uu haysan wax uu sheego.
I did not take it.	Maan qaadan.
I did not think so.	Uma malaynayn.
He is happy.	Wuu ku faraxsan yahay.
This may be.	Tani waa laga yaabaa.
He did not have one now, but he would soon.	Hadda mid ma uu haysan, laakiin wuu dhawaan lahaa.
I am for that.	taas ayaan u ahay.
I'm glad they are new.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay cusub yihiin.
It will not do.	Ma yeeli doonto.
I was very surprised, but they still exist.	Aad baan ula yaabay, laakiin weli way jiraan.
That really is a good thing.	Runtii taasi waa wax fiican.
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
I can't leave	Ma bixi karo
It is not small.	Ma aha mid yar.
I really do not understand why.	Runtii ma fahmin sababta.
I know why you are here	Waan ogahay sababta aad halkan u joogto
He didn't want you to know.	Ma uusan rabin inaad ogaato.
It's done.	Waa la isku sameeyay.
She found that hard.	Way ku ogaatay taas si adag.
I did not think it existed.	Uma malaynayn inay jirto.
There is nothing new here.	Ma jiraan wax cusub oo halkan lagu arko.
It is not difficult.	Ma aha mid adag.
I really can't.	Runtii ma awoodo.
I should not have.	Ma ahayn inaan haysto.
I am not a real person.	Ma ihi qof dhab ah oo dhab ah.
Not much to talk about.	Wax badan in laga hadlo maaha.
All in all it was great.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
It can go	Way tagi kartaa
I would see him.	Waan arki lahaa isaga.
There is no charge for that.	Lacag kuma jirto taas.
I am sure that will not be a problem.	Waxaan hubaa in taasi aysan dhibaato noqon doonin.
That really was.	Taasi runtii waxay ahayd.
That will not happen.	Taasi kuma ay dhici doonin.
More than me.	Wax iga sii badan.
I got it now	hadda waan ku helay
He was too much for everything.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u badan wax walba.
That can never happen again.	Taasi mar dambe ma dhici karto.
Please I hope this is a job for you.	Fadlan waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay adiga kuu tahay shaqo.
It will not be clear.	Ma noqon doonto mid cad.
That can be difficult.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
That's no problem.	Taasi dhib malaha.
How weird, right? 	Sidee yaab leh, sax?
.	.
I don't see why you do it.	Ma arko sababta aad u sameyso.
And so it is now available.	Oo sidaas ayaa hadda la heli karaa.
We can't talk about that.	Taas kama hadli karno.
I make more money than he does.	Waxaan sameeyaa lacag ka badan inta uu sameeyo.
He should have.	Waxay ahayd inuu haysto.
How was it?	Sidee ahayd?
I am a person, and I need things.	Waxaan ahay qof, oo waxaan u baahanahay waxyaabo.
As a man.	Nin ahaan.
But there were other things.	Laakiin waxyaabo kale ayaa lahaa.
Please no one can help.	Fadlan qofna ma caawin karaa.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
It will be smarter	Waxay noqon doontaa mid caqli badan
This is the latter.	Tani waa tan dambe.
Three is enough.	Saddex ayaa ku filan.
There is no other way.	Si kale oo loo sheego ma jirto.
Good man.	Nin wanaagsan.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
Almost everyone does, from time to time.	Inta badan qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa, waqti ka waqti.
Clear by day.	Cad maalin ahaan.
It will end.	Way soo dhammaan doontaa.
But someone must.	Laakiin qof waa inuu.
I didn't give you much time.	Kuma siin waqti badan.
More is coming.	Wax badan ayaa soo socda.
No one.	Cidna ma jirto.
But that is not a new idea.	Laakiin taasi maaha fikrad cusub.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I'm sure he will be with you soon.	Waxaan hubaa inuu dhawaan kula joogi doono.
Not bad.	Wax xun maaha.
I entered.	waan galay.
Nothing happened.	Wax dhacay ma jirin.
Who really knows.	Yaa runtii yaqaan.
He did not come home.	Guriga ma iman.
I don't like work.	Ma jecli shaqada.
I thought we were lucky.	Waxaan mooday inaan nasiib badan nahay.
I think less is more than best.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in ka yar ayaa ka badan ayaa ugu fiican.
I am still like that.	Wali sidaas ayaan ahay.
It may not be taken.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan la qaadan.
That was said.	Taas baa loo sheegay.
Here you can find everything.	Halkan waxaad ka heli kartaa wax walba.
It just isn’t done.	Kaliya lama samayn.
No one has done this before.	Qofna hore uma samayn tan.
He did it tonight.	Caawa ayuu sameeyay.
It has been reported.	Waa la soo sheegay.
That is all you need to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
You are the one he needs.	Adiga ayaa ah kan uu u baahan yahay.
I did not find anything	waxba maan helin
I can't now.	Hadda ma awoodo.
All of me.	Aniga oo dhan.
Enough for him.	Isaga ku filan.
you can't stay	ma joogi kartid
I fell behind	Dib ayaan u dhacay
I think that is another time.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wakhti kale.
And every day.	Iyo maalin kasta.
maybe not too.	laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale.
you were real.	dhab baad ahayd.
There is no time for a friend.	Waqti ma jiro saaxiib.
It was over.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan.
There was so much.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u badan.
She doesn't want to be with him now.	Ma aha inay rabto inuu la joogo hadda.
There really is no.	Runtii ma jirto.
I'm out now.	Hadda ayaan ka baxay.
Not much, but something.	Ma badna, laakiin wax.
You can't lie.	Been uma sheegi kartid.
Much needs to be learned.	Wax badan ayaa u baahan in la barto.
I would very much like this to be brought up again.	Waxaan aad u jeclaan lahaa in tan mar kale la soo qaado.
What did he say?	Muxuu yidhi?
Maybe less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka yar.
Here and everywhere.	Halkan iyo meel kasta.
You can't leave	Ma bixi kartid
And this was now.	Oo tani waxay ahayd hadda.
That's how she likes it.	Taasi waa sida ay ugu jeceshahay.
I took something.	Wax baan u qaatay.
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
She's really smart.	Runtii way caqli badan tahay.
Probably everything.	Malaha wax walba.
It is probably very good.	Waxay u badan tahay inay runtii aad u fiican tahay.
So was another man.	Sidaas ayuu nin kale ahaa.
This is a lie.	Tani waa been.
What happened is what happened.	Maxaa dhacay waa wixii dhacay.
I really can't stop	Runtii ma joojin karo
It was a bit weird.	Waxay ahayd xoogaa yaab leh.
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax yar kula hadlo.
He wants me to go too.	Waxa uu rabaa in aan sidoo kale tago.
I will address this	Tan ayaan wax ka qaban doonaa
It doesn't look real.	Wax dhab ah uma eka.
You are good here	Waa ku fiican tahay halkan
I hope they are.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay yihiin.
I pretended.	Waan iska dhigay.
Wherever you like.	Meel kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
And they don't talk much.	Oo aanay in badan ka hadlin.
It's three o'clock.	Waa saddex ka dib.
I don't have time for that.	Waqti uma hayo taas.
I need it first	Waxaan u baahanahay hore
Not as we are today.	Ma aha sida aan maanta nahay.
Maybe something happened to me.	Malaha wax iga yimid.
It's really not a problem.	Runtii dhib maaha.
It was awful, whatever it was.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun, wax kasta oo ay ahayd.
It would be something.	Waxa uu noqon lahaa wax.
I know what he wants me to say.	Waan garanayaa waxa uu rabo in aan sheego.
I'm glad he's here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu halkan joogo.
As she found out.	Sidii ay wax u ogaatay.
It's like this.	Waa sida tan.
That was three years ago.	Taasi waa saddex sano ka hor.
Tom appeared at the door.	Tom ayaa ka soo muuqday albaabka.
Now I know this is not true.	Hadda waxaan ogahay in tani aysan run ahayn.
It was bad enough.	Waxay ahayd mid xun oo ku filan.
They are probably very small.	Malaha aad bay u yar yihiin.
It does not exist now.	Hadda ma jirto.
I did not think so.	Uma malaynayn taas.
So should you.	Sidaas oo kale waa in aad.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
This was when, a long time ago now.	Tani waxay ahayd markii, waqti dheer ka hor hadda.
That is what we do.	Taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
I can't, really.	Ma awoodo, runtii.
He just thought he had it.	Kaliya wuxuu mooday inuu ku leeyahay.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
Maybe one day I will.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hal maalin sameeyo.
One person did not know.	Hal qof ma garanayn.
I just didn’t know.	Kaliya maan garanayn.
Don't take that for granted.	Ha u qaadan taas.
I do bad things.	Waxaan sameeyaa waxyaabo xun.
Just to know that.	Kaliya in la ogaado taas.
younger than me.	iga yar.
Maybe I can learn from you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax kaa barto.
You do not need	Uma baahnid
I like it	waan ka helay
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
You can do this for me.	Waad ii samayn kartaa tan aniga.
It does not look like anyone else.	Qof kale uma eka.
It wasn't a lot of money.	Lacag badan ma ahayn.
This was a lot of money.	Tani waxay ahayd lacag aad u badan.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.	Ma hubo in taasi tahay fikrad wanaagsan iyo in kale.
But that is not the same.	Laakiin taasi isku mid maaha.
He did not like it, and wondered if it was true.	Ma uu jeclayn, oo wuxuu is waydiiyay inay run tahay.
I didn't say much today.	Wax badan ma sheegin maanta.
Don't be.	Ha noqon.
You are very smart.	Aad baad u caqli badan tahay.
There is something	Wax baa jira
This was really true.	Runtii tani run bay ahayd.
I do not know if this is true or not.	Ma garanayo inay tani sax tahay iyo in kale.
He really and really loves me.	Runtii iyo runtii wuu i jecel yahay.
Really don’t think you do but do not think.	Runtii ha u malayn inaad samaynayso laakiin ma u malaynaysaa.
I do not	Anigu ma samaynayo
But that is not how it is.	Laakiin taasi maaha sida ay tahay.
That's bad for me.	Taasi waa aniga xun.
I got some money.	Waxaan helay xoogaa lacag ah.
Someone has to do it.	Qof waa inuu sameeyaa.
Maybe it was bad luck.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd nasiib xun.
But no one really does.	Laakiin qofna run ahaantii ma jiro.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
I am here	halkaan ayaan joogaa
You are good at it.	Waad ku fiican tahay.
Do not lie.	Been ha sheegin.
I thought it sounded like a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay u egtahay fikrad wanaagsan.
If anyone could tell me, that would be great.	Haddii qof ii sheegi karo, taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
But someone was there, right.	Laakiin qof baa meesha joogay, waa sax.
I used to enjoy it	Waan ka heli jiray
There is also no friend.	Sidoo kale saaxiib ma jiro.
He wasn’t a bad guy, really.	Ma ahayn nin xun, runtii.
I would love how it looks	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa sida ay u egtahay
It may be done now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in hadda la sameeyo.
I know we can do it.	Waan ogahay inaan sameyn karno.
They are very small now.	Hadda aad bay u yar yihiin.
I looked up	Waxaan eegay meel dhow
I found other things.	Waxyaabo kale ayaan ku helay.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jirto.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ma rabo inaan cidna arko.
That did.	Taasi waxay samaysay.
Hard, not many.	Adag, ma badna.
She knew he had done it.	Way ogaatay inuu sameeyay.
You are the best.	Adiga ayaa ugu fiican.
You just can't win.	Kaliya ma guulaysan kartid.
This is not the case.	Tani maaha taas.
There is nothing new.	Wax cusub ma jiraan.
He did not get it.	Ma uu helin.
Three people.	Saddex qof.
Please catch me.	Fadlan i qabo.
Everything else is as it was.	Wax kasta oo kale waa sidii ay ahayd.
Not him.	Ma isaga.
Still not right.	Wali sax maaha.
It is very interesting.	Aad bay u xiiso badan tahay.
Maybe I didn't want to know.	Malaha maan rabin inaan ogaado.
Even more so.	Xitaa inta badan.
I had to find out who.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado cidda.
Also, a little too long.	Sidoo kale, wax yar ayaa aad u dheer.
We can't stay here.	Halkan kuma joogi karno.
It was not the same as expected.	La mid ma ahayn sidii la rabay.
You are probably a loved one.	Waxay u badan tahay in aad tahay qof la jecel yahay.
Too much, even.	Aad u badan, xitaa.
I was well impressed.	Si fiican ayaan ula dhacay.
did you know that.	ma taas ma ogtahay.
I really don't know how to say it.	Runtii ma garanayo sida loo sheego.
You love it.	Waad jeceshahay.
I am loved	waa la i jecel yahay
This is often done today.	Tan waxaa la sameeyaa maanta inta badan.
This she realized.	Tani way ogaatay.
Please stop that.	Fadlan jooji taas.
I do not feel that way now.	Anigu sidaas uma dareemayo hadda.
But that is enough.	Laakiin taas waa ku filan tahay.
There was no one there.	Meesha qofna ma jirin.
But it was something.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax.
A little longer.	In yar oo dheer.
That is no longer me.	Taasi aniga mar dambe maaha.
He is a bigger man and a better friend.	Waa nin weyn iyo saaxiib ka sii fiican.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
Like, a lot more.	Sida, wax badan oo kale.
We knew we could do better.	Waxaan ogeyn inaan wax ka wanaagsan sameyn karno.
You did not speak.	Aadan ma hadlin.
It is very difficult that way.	Aad bay u adag tahay sidaas.
Maybe that's the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ugu fiican tahay.
She will love this one.	Way jeclaan doontaa kan.
And so it is.	Oo waa sidaas.
But there is.	Laakiin waxaa jira.
Not too bad.	Aad uma xun.
But I did not understand.	Laakiin ma fahmin.
I will stay	waan joogi doonaa
But they may be too many.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u badan yihiin.
I know you.	waan ku garanayaa.
Not where I say it.	Meesha aan u sheego maaha.
Someone did, that's for sure.	Qof baa sameeyay, taasi waa hubaal.
So far, that is.	Ilaa hadda, taasi waa.
At work.	Shaqada.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
Maybe he did.	Malaha wuu sameeyay.
I would get that later.	Waxaan heli lahaa taas mar dambe.
But you know what happened.	Laakiin waad ogtahay waxa dhacay.
No problem.	Dhib maaha.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
It was so big, so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn, qurux badan.
It is the only thing to do now.	Waa waxa kaliya ee la sameeyo hadda.
There was nothing he would have liked more.	Ma jirin wax uu jeclaan lahaa in ka badan.
Great, and you did it well.	Mid weyn, oo si fiican ayaad u samaysay.
It's a good job.	Waa shaqo fiican.
I really don't have it.	Runtii ma hayo.
You can always leave.	Had iyo jeer waad iska bixi kartaa.
This is really bad.	Tani runtii aad bay u xun tahay.
It will be very close.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u dhow.
Stayed and did so.	Joogay oo sidaas sameeyay.
But that, too, was beautiful.	Laakiin taasi, sidoo kale, waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
You cannot be everything to everyone.	Qof walba wax walba uma noqon kartid.
he could not take it.	wuu qaadan waayay.
No one told him to do this.	Qofna uma sheegin inuu tan sameeyo.
He decided not to say.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuusan sheegin.
This too.	Tani sidoo kale.
Does everyone come by car?	Qof kastaa ma ku yimaado baabuur?
Less to go.	Mid ka yar inuu tago.
not you.	ma adiga .
But there is more to it than that.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan taas.
It was here, very close.	Waxay ahayd halkan, aad u dhow.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
And, not really.	Oo, si fiican ma aha.
I got a lot	Wax badan baan helay
There was not much else we could do.	Ma jirin wax kale oo badan oo aan sameyn karno.
Just thought you knew.	Kaliya u maleeyay inaad ogaato.
Lots of them.	In badan oo ka mid ah.
Now it is everywhere.	Hadda waa meel walba.
I thought he was a very good man.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu yahay nin aad u fiican.
He said a little to me.	Wax yar ayuu igu yidhi.
Maybe you can get more out of him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad wax badan ka heli karto isaga.
You can make a lot of money.	Waxaad samayn kartaa lacag badan.
I knew.	Waan ogaa.
I can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karo.
And the same for him.	Oo isla isaga isaga.
He is not alone.	Isaga kaliya maaha.
Right, he did.	Sax, wuu sameeyay.
First, nothing.	Marka hore, waxba.
It was a great place.	Waxay ahayd meel fiican.
For sure.	Waxa hubaal ah.
He is a friend.	Waa saaxiib.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
I do not know what he is doing.	Waxa uu samaynayo ma garanayo.
He did not allow it.	Uma uu ogolaan.
I love helping people.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo dadka.
And again.	Iyo mar kale.
I started with you.	Waan ku bilaabay.
But she knows it's too early.	Laakiin way ogtahay inay goor hore tahay.
But there was nowhere.	Laakiin ma jirin meel.
He had something to tell me.	Wax uu ii sheego ayuu lahaa.
I do not know if this is a good idea.	Ma garanayo inay taasi tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
It will all be.	Dhammaan way ahaan doontaa.
I can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karo.
No one will do that to you.	Qofna sidaas kuu yeeli maayo.
Surprisingly, it was not too difficult.	Si la yaab leh, ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
I have to see	Waa inaan arko
It's a problem, a real problem.	Waa dhibaato, dhibaato dhab ah.
She told everyone what had happened.	Waxay u sheegtay qof walba wixii dhacay.
It was amazing, really.	Waxay ahayd yaab, runtii.
You look beautiful	Waxaad u egtahay qurux
At school.	Dugsiga .
It’s hard, really.	Waa adag tahay, run ahaantii.
He spent a lot of time with us and was very helpful.	Waqti badan ayuu nala qaatay oo aad buu u caawin jiray.
What do you like to eat?	Maxaad jeceshahay inaad cunto?
He refused to tell her again.	Wuu diiday inuu mar dambe u sheego.
Better yet, obviously.	Si ka wanaagsan, si cad.
Now, something else.	Hadda, wax kale.
I did.	waan sameeyay.
What did he know.	Muxuu ogaa.
That is why he is so close.	Taasi waa sababta uu aad ugu dhow yahay.
Now they are too many.	Hadda aad bay u badan yihiin.
Why didn't you come yesterday?	maxaad shalay u iman wayday?
It can be true.	Waxay noqon kartaa run.
I think that's great.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi weyn tahay.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
Everyone seemed to think this was a good idea.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqday in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
No one will be here.	Qofna halkan ma joogi doono.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
I would definitely get that.	Dhab ahaantii waan heli lahaa taas.
This can come in handy.	Tani waxay u iman kartaa si adag.
As of now, nothing has been done.	Sida ay hadda tahay, waxba lama qaban.
More is enough for me today.	Wax ka badan ayaa igu filan maanta.
That is why he bought this.	Taasi waa sababta uu kan u iibsaday.
Let me help you.	Aan ku caawiyo.
She would stay.	Way joogi lahayd.
Don't do it.	Ha samayn.
There is little to eat and little money.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo la cuno iyo lacag yar.
I am happy for you	waan kugu faraxsanahay
He did not want to leave what he was feeling.	Ma uu rabin in uu ka tago waxa uu dareemayo.
We can no longer do it.	Mar dambe ma samayn karno.
I would love to see that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
But, we will see.	Laakiin, waan arki doonaa.
I do not know now what happened to him.	Ma garanayo hadda waxa ku dhacay.
It will take a lot of time.	Waxay ku qaadan doontaa waqti badan.
And you can get it.	Oo waad heli kartaa.
There is something you may know.	Waxaa jira wax laga yaabo inaad ogaato.
Not much else to say.	Wax badan oo kale oo laga sheego ma aha.
She is right.	Run bay sheegtay.
I felt it.	Waan dareemay.
He decided.	Wuu go'aansaday.
It is already before.	Waa hore ka hor .
A little closer.	In yar oo dhow.
He had a lot to do.	Wuxuu lahaa wax badan oo uu qaban lahaa.
I just did.	Kaliya waan sameeyay.
Just not sure.	Kaliya ma hubo.
Just a bit.	Kaliya xoogaa.
I have no money to buy anything.	Ma haysto lacag aan wax ku iibsado.
He was here.	Halkan ayuu ahaa.
He saw something else.	Wax kale ayuu arkay.
Otherwise no problem.	Haddii kale dhib ma leh.
It was not a day.	Maalin ma ahayn.
I used to see it every day.	Waxaan arki jiray maalin kasta.
That is what keeps you going.	Taasi waa waxa ku sii wada.
I can do anything.	Wax walba waan samayn karaa.
It was tough, it wasn’t a good time.	Waxay ahayd mid adag, ma ahayn waqti fiican.
That has something to do with it.	Taasi wax bay leedahay.
I want something else	wax kale ayaan rabaa
No one would stop.	Qofna ma joojin lahaa.
But well, maybe this is not a problem.	Laakiin si fiican, malaha tani dhib maaha.
Otherwise, it was very difficult.	Haddii kale, waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
There was no food to buy.	Ma jirin cunto la iibsado.
I have to stay here.	Waa inaan halkaan joogo.
I really have no idea.	Runtii fikrad ma qabo.
But this is not what this is.	Laakiin tani maaha waxa tani tahay.
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
And, it really is.	Oo, runtii waa.
I will do it.	waan yeeli doonaa.
I hope you will like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto.
Obviously, it is more complicated than this.	Sida cad, way ka sii dhib badan tahay tan.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
It looks like	Waxay u egtahay
Now he is not gone.	Hadda maaha wuu baxay.
That is not surprising.	Taasi la yaab maaha.
He wanted more and more.	Wax badan iyo wax ka badan ayuu rabay.
Do not pay.	Waxba ha bixin.
Not as long as you are there.	Ma aha ilaa inta aad halkaas joogto.
I would love to see you there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko halkaas
Can you give it to me tomorrow?	Ma i siin kartaa berri?
That was awful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It is what it is, nothing else.	Waa waxa ay tahay, wax kale maaha.
I will talk to him.	waan la hadli doonaa isaga.
This is not something anyone wants.	Tani maaha wax qofna rabo.
Probably, it was rejected a lot.	Malaha, waxaa la diiday wax badan.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
What is it.	Waa maxay.
But everyone has something to say about him.	Laakiin mid kastaa wuxuu leeyahay wax uu ka sheego isaga.
So still.	Sidaas weli.
That's how he saw me.	Sidaas ayuu ii arkay.
There is so much to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo.
We love it.	Waanu jeclayn.
I doubt they will come back again.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay mar kale soo noqon doonaan.
I think you can get interested.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad xiiso u heli karto.
But now he knew that was not true.	Laakiin hadda wuu ogaa in taasi run ahayn.
But now everyone seemed to know.	Laakiin hadda qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqday inuu garanayo.
A new one has arrived.	Mid cusub ayaa soo galay.
It was something new.	Waxay ahayd wax cusub.
It is only one day.	Waa hal maalin oo kaliya.
I went to stay.	Waxaan aaday inaan sii joogo.
It was beautiful, he said.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan, ayuu yidhi.
I looked back.	Dib baan u eegay.
We'll see if you can do that.	Waan arki doonaa inaad taas samayn karto.
You can really see everything.	Runtii wax walba waad arki kartaa.
Maybe I still have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan weli haysto mid.
That is why he was there.	Taasi waa sababta uu halkaas u joogay.
It does nothing for me.	Waxba igama samaynayso aniga.
This is not for me, obviously.	Tani aniga ma ahan, iska cad.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
That can't help.	Taas ma caawin karo.
The back door here.	Albaabka dambe halkan.
And so you were most of the time.	Oo sidaas ayaad ahayd inta badan.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
I should not have gone.	Ma ahayn inaan tago.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
I don't think he came out.	Uma maleynayo inuu soo baxay.
But, that was it.	Laakiin, taasi waxay ahayd.
Not very friendly.	Aad uma saaxiib.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
You do not need to do this now.	Uma baahnid inaad tan hadda samayso.
Sure, you have.	Hubaal, waxaad leedahay.
Time to go.	Waqti aan tagi lahaa.
Tell him to do something.	U sheeg inuu wax sameeyo.
It is not clear now.	Hadda ma cad.
Much is clear.	In badan ayaa cad.
I think it is good.	Waxaan qabaa inay tahay mid wanaagsan.
I didn't think it was a good idea.	Uma malaynayn inay fikrad fiican tahay.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
It’s me again.	Waa aniga mar kale.
He told her he wanted everything.	Wuxuu u sheegay inuu wax walba ka rabo.
Every day, one, one day.	Maalin kasta, hal, maalin.
You can't see that.	Taas ma arki kartid.
That is really hard for us.	Runtii taasi waa nagu adag tahay.
Maybe she already did.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay hore u samaysay.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I love you	waan ku jeclahay
He would go alone to get it.	Keligiis ayuu tagi jiray si uu u helo.
That is the ‘place’.	Taasi waa 'meesha'.
You will be what you are.	Waxaad noqon doontaa waxaad tahay.
Too bad, really.	Mid aad u xun, dhab ahaantii.
They will talk closely.	Si dhow bay u hadli doonaan.
Good things and bad things.	Waxyaabo wanaagsan iyo wax xun.
We were just.	Waxaan ahayn kaliya.
tell me if it is not.	ii sheeg haddii aysan ahayn.
Could he do more?	Ma laga yaabaa inuu wax badan sameeyo?
Good day!.	Maalin wanaagsan!.
He decided it wasn't.	Waxa uu go'aansaday in aanay ahayn.
.	.
I do not speak.	ma hadlo.
This was so.	Tani waxay ahayd sidaas.
Now she didn't have it.	Hadda ma aysan haysan.
I didn't like it much.	Wax badan ma jeclayn.
And he knows, too.	Oo wuu garanayaa, sidoo kale.
Everyone is very nice.	Qof walba aad buu u fiican yahay.
That would be interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
Aad.	Aad.
It is one thing and one thing at a time.	Waa wax iyo waxba isku mar.
How are you.	Sidee tahay adiga.
But he could not believe it.	Laakiin wuu rumaysan waayay.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
Obviously.	Sida cad.
I'm afraid to do anything.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan wax sameeyo.
I will tell you what will happen.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa dhici doona.
I did not think so.	Uma malaynayn.
I hope you will do a better job.	Waxaan filayaa inaad shaqo ka wanaagsan qaban doonto.
He is a man.	Waa nin.
One small.	Mid yar.
The bigger it is the better.	Ka weyn ayaa ka fiican.
I still own it.	Wali waan iska leeyahay.
It sounds complicated.	Waxay u egtahay mid adag.
Do not think that anyone else has heard.	Ha u malayn in qof kale maqlay.
As he wished.	Sidii uu sidaas u rabay.
An empty space.	Meel aan waxba ka jirin.
We can't pay now.	Hadda ma bixin karno.
He really wanted something else.	Runtii wax kale ayuu rabay.
This must be done.	Tani waa in la sameeyaa.
I can't believe she's here.	Ma rumaysan karo inay halkan joogto.
To find out more.	Si aad wax badan uga ogaato.
It would be nice if someone could help me.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii qof iga caawin karo.
He did not want to do this.	Ma uusan rabin inuu tan sameeyo.
I thought you would be home now.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad guriga noqon doonto hadda.
I have no idea what it is.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay.
I do not want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
I did everything.	Wax walba waan sameeyay.
And good thing.	Iyo wax fiican.
This was as amazing as it was interesting.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la yaab leh sida ay u ahayd mid xiiso leh.
Everything else is good to have.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa ku fiican in la haysto.
That should be more than enough.	Taasi waa inay ka badan tahay ku filan.
He really wanted it.	Runtii aad buu u rabay.
Anyone other than him.	Qof kasta oo aan isaga ahayn.
I do not know what he did to you.	Ma garanayo waxa uu kugu sameeyay.
That is true enough.	Taas oo run ku filan.
What a great idea.	Waa maxay fikrad fiican.
I have no problem doing that again.	Dhib kama qabo inaan taas mar kale sameeyo.
Maybe not much time.	Malaha waqti badan.
What she needs.	Waxa ay u baahan tahay.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.	Waan ka xumahay, aad baan uga xumahay.
Really, just beautiful.	Runtii, kaliya qurux badan.
You are very new.	Aad baad u cusub tahay.
She had no idea what she was going to do.	Wax fikrad ah ma ay lahayn waxay samayn doonto.
In fact, it shouldn’t be surprising.	Runtii, waa inaysan noqon wax la yaab leh.
The latter is by far my favorite.	Tan dambe waa ilaa hadda aan ugu jeclahay.
Anyone in trouble would help.	Qof kasta oo dhib ku jiro wuu caawin lahaa.
That's why he entered.	Waa sababta uu u galay.
Does it exist	Ma jiraa
You look like him.	Waxaad u egtahay isaga oo kale.
He got it right.	Si sax ah ayuu u helay.
There is really no problem.	Dhab ahaantii wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
That was not stated.	Taas lama sheegin.
I love the best.	Waxaan jeclahay kan ugu fiican.
A little longer	In yar oo dheer
They live in it.	Way ku nool yihiin.
But now I am happy.	Laakiin hadda waan faraxsanahay.
At first it was too much.	Markii hore waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
You will stay here	Waxaad joogi doontaa halkan
If anything, he would get it.	Haddii ay wax jiraan, wuu heli lahaa.
Now he is back.	Hadda wuu soo noqday.
No one is sure why.	Qofna ma hubo sababta.
Maybe that and more.	Malaha taas iyo in ka badan.
I still haven't found it	Wali ma helin
That will not do.	Taasi ma yeeli doonto.
No one and no one had it.	Qofna iyo qof walba ma lahayn.
But he didn't need to tell her what it was.	Laakiin uma baahnayn inuu u sheego waxay ahayd.
I will not stay.	Ma joogi doono.
It was small.	Waxay ahayd mid yar.
I really should.	Runtii waa inaan.
It's three o'clock.	Waa saddex ka dib.
No one else sees it.	Qof kale ma arko.
It's just that it's hard to do that.	Kaliya in ay adag tahay in sidaas la sameeyo.
Don't enjoy it.	Ha ka helin.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
This is not a bad thing.	Tani ma aha wax xun.
And a friend.	Iyo saaxiib.
He was not there, but he knows.	Ma uusan joogin, laakiin wuu ogyahay.
He just came in.	Hadda ayuu soo galay.
As it is, I can't.	Sida ay tahay, ma awoodo.
That is done.	Taasi waa la sameeyaa.
I have one.	Mid baan leeyahay.
No one can.	Qofna ma awoodo.
I look forward to more.	Waxaan si aad ah u rajeynayaa wax badan.
There was nothing else for him here.	Ma jirin wax kale isaga halkan.
It can be anything.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
I had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo.
In fact, they did not know.	Dhab ahaantii, ma ay garanayn.
I love working there.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan ka shaqeeyo halkaas.
He took it.	Wuu ka qaaday.
Give it some time.	Sii xoogaa waqti ah.
But he knew, again, that this was not true.	Laakiin wuu ogaa, mar kale, in tani aysan run ahayn.
And other things, too.	Iyo waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
In the same way.	Si la mid ah.
He was in a lot of trouble.	Dhib badan buu ku jiray.
I would do everything for you	Wax walba waan kuu qaban lahaa
But he knew what would happen.	Laakiin wuu ogaa waxa dhici doona.
It is still the same.	Weli waa sidii hore.
He took it.	Wuu ku qaatay.
But it will be tomorrow.	Laakiin berri wuu noqon doonaa.
And only you can see.	Oo kaliya waad arki kartaa.
He would be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
Spend a lot of time.	Waqti badan ku qaatay.
What a day, he thought.	Maxaa maalin ah, ayuu u maleeyay.
I don't know why they don't speak.	Ma garanayo sababta aysan u hadlin.
He really did.	Dhab ahaantii wuu sameeyay.
I told him good job.	Shaqo fiican ayaan u sheegay.
There is really nothing left.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan wax laga tago.
It's hard, it's hard.	Way adag tahay, way adag tahay.
One promised.	Mid ballan qaaday.
I knew that for sure.	Waan ogaa taas hubaal.
You will be.	Waxaad noqon doontaa.
But it is so.	Laakiin waa sidaas.
But she had things to do.	Laakiin waxay lahayd waxyaabo ay samayso.
But how to buy.	Laakiin sida loo iibsado.
This is often not true.	Tani inta badan run maaha.
Everything you need.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
I need to talk to him now.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo hadda.
Just to help	Kaliya si aad u caawiso
I am at home.	Guriga baan joogaa.
Not that you were.	Ma aha inaad ahayd.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiro.
I don't know, nothing new.	Ma garanayo, wax cusub.
It is smaller here.	Way ka yar tahay halkan.
It's too much.	Way aad u badan tahay.
But he knew.	Laakiin wuu ogaa.
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u fiican.
And really everywhere.	Iyo runtii meel kasta.
What can be done will be done.	Waxa la samayn karo waa la samayn doonaa.
Much the same as before.	In badan oo la mid ah sidii hore.
He was the one who wanted to know.	Wuxuu ahaa kii la rabay inuu wax ogaado.
You would love that.	Waad jeclaan lahayd taas.
He came out with difficulty.	Si dhib leh ayuu uga soo baxay.
I just think it is as it is.	Kaliya waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay sida ay tahay.
I can't even afford it.	Xitaa ma awoodo.
Often this is what you want to do.	Inta badan tani waa waxa aad rabto inaad sameyso.
Something is wrong here	Wax aan halkan sax ahayn
I think it can happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici karto.
Probably the best.	Malaha sida ugu wanaagsan.
We had no friends there.	Halkaas saaxiibo kuma lahayn.
He did not give.	Ma uu siin.
In fact, everything else you do is the same.	Runtii, wax kasta oo kale oo aad sameyso waa isku mid.
He is in trouble.	Dhib buu ku jiraa.
He took everything from me.	Wax walba wuu iga qaatay.
One big problem	Hal dhibaato oo weyn
Now he felt everything.	Hadda wax walba wuu dareemay.
Another place is food.	Meel kale waa cunto.
He is said to be missing.	Waxaa la sheegay in la waayay.
Maybe we are already.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hore u nahay.
He stays at work.	Waxa uu ku sii jiraa shaqada.
But often this is not done.	Laakiin inta badan tan lama sameeyo.
Please have a good time.	Fadlan waqti fiican qaado.
I think they are very good.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u wanaagsan yihiin.
He was very interesting.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
It would not be.	Ma ay ahaan lahayd.
I want him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan isaga rabo.
He is a beautiful man.	Waa nin qurux badan.
No one can do it.	Qof ma samayn karaa.
And lied.	Oo been ka sheegay.
They really do.	Dhab ahaantii way sameeyaan.
This may be correct.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid sax ah.
Really beautiful.	Runtii aad u qurux badan.
He knew that.	Wuu ogaa taas.
Maybe surprise.	Malaha yaab.
I tried to speak.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan hadlo.
They will definitely get better !.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ku heli doonaan si fiican!.
I returned.	Waan ku noqday.
And it's good that you.	Oo way wanaagsan tahay inaad.
It's not like he can see me.	Ma aha sida inuu i arki karo.
To be like him.	Si uu isaga la mid noqdo.
You are more than enough.	Waad ka badan tahay ku filan.
He was not.	Ma uusan ahayn.
We live here now.	Waxaan hadda ku nool nahay halkan.
But that is because of who they are.	Laakiin taasi waa sababta oo ah cidda ay yihiin.
There is no money.	Lacag ma jirto.
I did not see one coming.	Maan arag mid soo socda.
I am ready now	hadda diyaar ayaan ahay
Tomorrow he will do more than he did today.	Berrito wuxuu samayn doonaa wax ka badan inta uu maanta sameeyay.
He can speak, but he does not speak.	Wuu hadli karaa, laakiin ma hadlo.
He said again and again.	Mar iyo mar kale ayuu yiri.
Probably a lot of the same.	Malaha wax badan oo isku mid ah.
He did not say.	Ma uusan odhan.
Maybe you are a little bit.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad xoogaa yar tahay.
He told me he did.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu sameeyay.
I'm not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta ay sidaas u tahay.
He will be here for a while	Wax yar ayuu halkan joogi doonaa
I have no problem	Dhib ima qabo
I told you this.	Tan ayaan kuu sheegay.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
Take him!	Isaga qaado!
I think he can help.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku caawin karo.
It will be better for a while now.	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa in muddo ah hadda.
We can't take this.	Ma qaadan karno tan.
She did not understand very well.	Si fiican uma ay fahmin.
But he was more than just real.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa in ka badan oo kaliya dhab ah.
It can not help what it looks like.	Ma caawin karto sida ay u egtahay.
But he looked up.	Laakiin wuu eegay.
I know her well.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
I can't get that back.	Taas dib uma heli karo.
What a good man he has become.	Waa maxay nin fiican oo uu noqday.
It really is a great place.	Runtii waa meel aad u fiican.
I wish there was someone else.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu jiro qof kale.
I do not understand what I am going to do now.	Ma fahmin waxa aan aado hadda.
He said he did not like it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu jeclayn.
That would do the same.	Taasi waxay sameyn lahayd sidoo kale.
A lot was said.	Wax badan ayaa la odhan jiray.
he would win.	wuu guulaysan lahaa.
He must be with us.	Waa inuu nala joogo.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I need to get some	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo xoogaa
More than him, really.	In ka badan isaga, dhab ahaantii.
But that's how they say nothing.	Laakiin waa sida aanay waxba u odhan.
Someone will do this for you.	Qof ayaa tan kuu samayn doona.
Tell them.	U sheeg.
And this is where they live.	Oo tan ay ku nool yihiin.
That is what it means to me.	Taasi waa waxa ay aniga ila tahay.
I hope you find it interesting.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ka heli doonto mid xiiso leh.
It didn't pay off.	Wax walba ma bixin.
I told him, nothing.	Waxaan u sheegay, waxba.
But she realized there was nothing she could do.	Laakiin way ogaatay inaysan jirin wax ay sameyn karto.
He was tall, very tall.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dheer, aad u dheer.
I can't leave	Ma bixi karo
I think it's too much for him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u badan isaga.
I really want it.	Aad baan u rabaa.
He was here.	Wuu halkan joogay.
And they are very friendly.	Oo aad bay u saaxiibo yihiin.
That is very bad.	Taasi aad bay u xun tahay.
Stop! 	Jooji!
For an idea of ​​why, please.	Wixii fikrad ah sababta, fadlan.
I just know.	Kaliya waan ogahay.
He said he didn't.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu samayn.
It was what he wanted.	Waxay ahayd wixii uu rabay.
I know it was weird but it was true.	Waan ogahay inay la yaab ahayd laakiin run ahayd.
Someone else was hurt.	Qof kale ayaa dhib ku dhacay.
You know all you need to know.	Waad ogtahay dhammaan waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
We don't do anything tonight.	Caawa waxba ma samayno.
It's a lot.	Waa wax aad u badan.
Everyone knows someone.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa qof.
Which would definitely be nice to have.	Taas oo hubaal ahaan u fiicnaan lahayd in la haysto.
It had to be abandoned.	Waxay ahayd in laga tago.
She will love you.	Way ku jeclaan doontaa.
Now he is closer.	Hadda wuu ka dhow yahay.
Maybe you like it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad jeceshahay
Certainly not, he thought.	Hubaal maaha, ayuu u maleeyay.
You are interesting.	Waxaad tahay mid xiiso leh.
I think everyone should know that.	Waxay ila tahay in qof walba uu taas ogaado.
I didn't want to know for sure.	Ma rabin inaan ogaado runtii.
If you don't want to be friends with me, fine.	Haddii aadan rabin inaad ila saaxiibo, fiican.
That was a lie.	Taasi been bay ahayd.
I just love it	Kaliya waan jeclahay
That is how it will be.	Taasi waa sida ay noqon doonto.
No one said much.	Qofna wax badan oo uu sheego ma jirin.
I really did.	Runtii waan galay.
Do not join.	Ha ka mid noqon.
Whatever she could do, she did.	Wixii ay qaban lahayd, way samaysay.
He knew what that looked like.	Wuu ogaa sida ay taasi u egtahay.
It is the right thing to do.	Waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
You have done what every man can do.	Nin walba wax uu samayn karo ayaad samaysay.
I thought it was a little.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax yar.
Still nothing.	Weli waxba.
He really liked it.	Aad ayuu uga helay.
You will need more now than ever before.	Waxaad hadda u baahan doontaa in ka badan sidii hore.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
He wondered what she would say.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa ay odhan doonto.
Maybe he would.	Malaha wuu yeeli lahaa.
I should be happy to be here.	Waa inaan ku faraxsanahay inaan joogo.
Adag.	Adag.
And not very good, too.	Oo aan aad u wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
A little.	Wax yar.
Everyone would give what they have.	Qof kastaa wuxuu siin lahaa wax uu haysto.
John, it is great to be with us.	John, aad bay u fiican tahay inaad nala joogto.
I can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban karo.
Ready to go.	Diyaar u ah inuu tago.
She is not here now.	Hadda ma joogto halkan.
I don't feel anything.	Waxba ma dareemayo.
I think it's right.	Waxaan filayaa inay sax tahay.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
you could not have.	ma aadan haysan karin.
Something very interesting happened to me.	Waxa igu dhacay wax aad u xiiso badan.
That is the only thing.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya.
If not, it is not.	Haddii aysan ahayn, ma aha.
But they do not do it any other way.	Laakiin si kale ma sameeyaan.
Maybe so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas tahay.
In fact, they do.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay sameeyaan.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
No one knows what to do.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa la sameeyo.
But that he is still here.	Laakiin in uu weli halkan joogo.
Will, no one can get everything, even you.	Doono, qofna ma heli karo wax walba, xitaa adiga.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
He is one of us.	Waa mid naga mid ah.
There is a lot going on	Wax badan baa ka socda
He found it where he is now.	Meesha uu hadda joogo ayuu ka helay.
There was nothing	Ma jirin wax
I will win	waan guulaysan doonaa
Only.	Kaliya.
It's more than most.	Way ka badan tahay inta badan.
This is what she wants.	Tani waa waxa ay rabto.
I need more	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan
He gave me nothing.	Waxba igama siin.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
She should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inay si fiican u ogaato.
He was in big trouble now.	Dhib weyn buu hadda ku jiray.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
He was not a great man.	Ma ahayn nin weyn.
Are you? 	Ma tahay?
Not with us.	Aan nala joogin.
is what.	waa waxa.
He should be here by now.	Waa inuu halkan joogo ilaa hadda.
I did what you said.	Waxaan sameeyay waxaad tidhi.
They are really beautiful.	Runtii waa qurux badan yihiin.
How they are in prison.	Sida ay xabsiga ugu jiraan.
She needed it to be a problem.	Waxay u baahnayn waxay ahayd dhibaato.
We would be together.	Waan wada joogi lahayn.
Not too long ago.	Ma aad u dheer ka hor.
He said to me.	Ayuu igu yidhi.
But it is difficult.	Laakiin way adag tahay.
I can't leave.	Ma bixi karo.
I have many friends who love me.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo badan oo i jecel.
Here is everything he said.	Waa kan wax walba oo uu ku yidhi.
Here and there.	Halkan iyo halkaas.
I will do everything for you	wax walba waan kuu qaban doonaa
I think you are one.	Waxaan filayaa inaad mid tahay.
Lots, lots, and lots of fun stuff out there.	Wax badan, badan, iyo waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh halkaas.
But maybe this is too.	Laakiin malaha tani waa sidoo kale.
But that was not the case.	Laakiin sidaas ma ahayn.
It was a very small day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u yar.
He came in.	Wuu u soo galay.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
Now he had three.	Hadda wuxuu lahaa saddex.
That will not hurt.	Taasi dhib ma yeeli doonto.
It can't be anything.	Waxba ma noqon karto.
I had no idea I was doing well for you.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaan si fiican kuu sameeyo.
I can not say.	Ma sheegi karo.
They will help me.	Way i caawin doonaan.
Correct what you want.	Sax waxa aad rabto.
Probably it was.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd.
I did well.	Waxaan sameeyay si fiican.
You must have a job.	Waa in aad shaqo leedahay.
That is a lie.	Taasi waa been.
It was a bad job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo xun.
Tell me again.	Mar kale ii sheeg.
He will go for a meal soon.	Waxa uu aadi doonaa cunto dhawaan.
I would like to stay	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan joogo
But there is some truth.	Laakiin waxaa jira xoogaa run ah.
But that would leave a lot to chance.	Laakiin taasi waxay ka tagi lahayd wax badan ilaa fursad.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda si fiican.
No one seems to know what is going on.	Qofna uma eka inuu garanayo waxa socda.
It can be anything you want.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
But only one.	Laakiin hal kaliya.
He could not believe he could see.	Ma rumaysan karin inuu arki karo.
The work is really good.	Runtii shaqada aad bay u fiican tahay.
Every adult is gone.	Qof kasta oo weyn ayaa ka tagay.
I thought you liked it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeceshahay.
I looked at the house.	Waxaan eegay guriga.
There was something.	Wax baa jiray .
But it is.	Laakiin waa.
You can actually get more than that.	Dhab ahaantii waxaad heli kartaa wax ka badan taas.
She said there was nothing wrong with it.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay waxba ka jirin.
I just want you to know.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato.
You are alone.	Waxaad tahay keligaa.
Was he.	Miyuu ahaa.
I need to see	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax arko
There are three of them.	Waxaa jira saddex ka mid ah.
I do not know what.	Ma garanayo waxa.
This is great.	Tani waa mid aad u fiican.
Whether it is available or not '.	Haddii la hayo iyo haddii kale'.
It is this unspoken.	Waa tan aan la hadlin.
I have no problem.	Dhib ma hayo.
No one wants it, everyone should have it.	Qofna ma rabo, qof walba waa inuu haysto.
You love people.	Waxaad jeceshahay dadka.
He said he did not want to.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu rabin.
He said it might help.	Wuxuu sheegay in laga yaabo inay ku caawiso.
I tried it once.	Waxaan isku dayay hal mar.
Someone left here.	Qof baa halkan uga tagay.
They are very serious.	Aad bay dhab u yihiin.
I was unable to do so.	Ma awoodin in aan sameeyo.
But three it was.	Laakiin saddex waxay ahayd.
I left.	Waan ka baxay.
You are tough.	Waad adag tahay.
Please do not say anything.	Fadlan waxba ha ku odhan.
He could do nothing else.	Wax kale ma uu samayn karin.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
I quickly looked back.	Degdeg ayaan dib u eegay.
He was very upset.	Aad buu uga noqday.
She would love that.	Way jeclaan lahayd taas.
that would be.	inay ahaan lahayd.
He must come.	Waa inuu yimaado.
There is nothing that he can do about it.	Ma aha in ay jiraan wax uu ka qaban karo.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
It would be beautiful.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid qurux badan.
He can do whatever he wants.	Wuxuu doono wuu samayn karaa.
There may have been a long time before that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu jiro mid dheer taas ka hor.
He had nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo uu aado ma uu haysan.
It cannot be true.	Run ma noqon karto.
I know what is good now.	Waan ogahay waxa wanaagsan hadda.
I really don't know how to do this.	Runtii ma garanayo sida tan loo sameeyo.
You do not need to eat anymore!	Uma baahnid inaad wax cunto ilaa mar dambe!
He can always tell.	Mar walba wuu sheegi karaa.
A long time ago.	Muddo dheer ka hor.
He went in a bit.	Wuu yara galay.
Do not give anything.	Waxba ha siin.
He did not want me.	Ima uu rabin.
Absolutely not!	Hubaal maaha!
Now, that doesn’t seem too bad.	Hadda, taasi uma eka mid aad u xun.
This is not as good.	Tani ma sida wanaagsan.
It is beautiful here	Waa qurux halkan
He decided what to do.	Wuxuu go'aansaday wuxuu samayn lahaa.
He looks like a good man.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa nin wanaagsan.
He wondered who they were, but decided it was nothing.	Waxa uu la yaabay cidda ay yihiin, laakiin waxa uu go'aansaday in aanay waxba ahayn.
I know you can't see everything.	Waan ogahay inaadan wax walba arki karin.
Maybe it was once.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in mar ay ahayd.
You must.	Waa in aad.
He had no idea he would be here.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inuu halkan joogi doono.
One more day.	Hal maalin oo kale.
There must be a problem.	Waa inay dhibaato jirto.
I do not love you	kuma jecli
A little too good.	In yar oo aad u fiican.
I think that's beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi qurux badan tahay.
Even that is uncertain.	Xitaa taasi lama hubo.
I hope someone can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof ku caawin karo.
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
He wondered if it was true.	Waxa uu is waydiiyay in ay run tahay.
But maybe she did.	Laakiin malaha way samaysay.
Everyone can get one.	Qof kastaa wuu heli karaa mid ka mid ah.
Very soon.	Waqti aad u dhow.
Maybe that's what it really was.	Malaha taasi waa waxa uu runtii ahaa.
It can be true.	Waxay noqon kartaa run.
I can't believe he's doing this to you.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan kugu samaynayo.
you can't really be.	dhab ma noqon kartid.
He tried to say something, but he could not speak.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu wax sheego, laakiin wuu hadli waayay.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ma rabo inaan cidna arko.
It would be a beautiful place.	Waxay ahaan lahayd meel qurux badan.
I couldn’t pay even if.	Ma bixin karin xitaa haddii.
Let me talk.	Aan hadlo.
Will you help us?	Ma nagu caawin doontaa?
They need you to know.	Waxay u baahan yihiin inaad ogaato.
Let me say no.	Aan odhan waa sidaas.
I'm afraid of something good.	Waxaan ka baqayaa wax wanaagsan.
I know you were a good friend.	Waan ogahay inaad ahayd saaxiib wanaagsan.
It would be nice to go now.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaan hadda tago.
Each of us.	Qof kasta oo naga mid ah.
But I do not know what he said.	Laakiin ma garanayo waxa uu yidhi.
I could not see well.	Si fiican ayaan u arki waayay.
He was a good man.	Nin fiican buu ahaa.
He got very little.	Wuxuu helay wax aad u yar.
I did not understand that.	Maan fahmin taas.
He would do that.	Taas wuu samayn lahaa.
I have to do more.	Waa inaan wax badan sameeyaa.
But there was no time for that.	Laakiin ma jirin waqti taas.
There you will find everything you need.	Halkaas waxaad ka heli doontaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I was like that.	Anigu sidaas ayaan ahaa.
I wondered what she really said.	Waxaan la yaabay waxay runtii tidhi.
But it really isn’t a big deal.	Laakiin runtii wax weyn maaha.
I do not know what they are.	Ma garanayo waxay yihiin.
I can stop.	Waan joojin karaa.
But it can be anyone.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
That doesn't matter.	Taasi waxba maaha.
I've never seen that before.	Weligay taas ma arag, ka hor.
I want to learn from you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax kaa barto.
I don't think she did.	Uma malaynayo inay samaysay.
Probably, really.	Waxay u badan tahay, dhab ahaantii.
You will get something.	Wax baad heli doontaa.
I hope everyone sees that.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu arko taas.
He did not leave	Ma bixin
But others will.	Laakiin dadka kale ayaa sameyn doona.
I think she would like it.	Waxaan filayaa inay jeclaan lahayd.
They are very difficult.	Aad bay u adag yihiin.
That is a good day.	Taasi waa maalin wanaagsan.
What you have to do.	Waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
As much as you want.	Inta aad rabto.
That is true enough.	Taasi waa run ku filan.
Not seen yet.	Ilaa hadda lama arag.
He thought.	Wuu mooday.
This did not happen.	Tani ma ay samayn.
Here is what you have to do.	Waa kan waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
But I need you.	Laakiin waan kuu baahanahay.
I hope you have had enough.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ku filan tahay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
Whatever she wanted, he gave her.	Wax kasta oo ay rabto, wuu siin jiray.
But that will take time and money.	Laakiin taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti iyo lacag.
That is not a problem.	Taasi dhib maaha.
Something was going to happen.	Wax ayaa dhici lahaa.
No luck.	Nasiib ma leh.
I did not say otherwise.	Si kale uma sheegin.
You have done that before.	Taas hore ayaad u samaysay.
Very, very.	Aad iyo aad.
I do not know where he is.	Ma garanayo meel uu joogo.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
That is the only thing everyone sees.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee qof kastaa arko.
She is definitely a person.	Waa hubaal in ay tahay qof.
I just want you to help him.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad caawiso isaga.
I need the job	Waxaan u baahanahay shaqada
Maybe he would leave.	Malaha wuu bixi lahaa.
No one else understood.	Qof kale ma fahmin.
I think it will happen soon.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhawaan dhici doonto.
But it can be anywhere.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa meel kasta.
You are really bad.	Waxaad tahay mid dhab ah oo xun.
I was already there.	Hore ayaan u joogay.
I do not know what happened to me.	Ma garanayo waxa igu dhacay.
you did very well.	si aad u wanaagsan ayaad samaysay.
It looks very small.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid aad u yar.
There is no food to eat.	Ma jirto cunto la cuno.
No one could say what happened.	Qofna ma sheegi karin waxa dhacay.
Maybe she is here.	Ma laga yaabaa inay halkan joogto.
I don't think it's too bad.	Uma maleynayo inay aad u xun tahay.
Big and small.	Mid weyn iyo mid yar.
There may be a new one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in mid cusub uu jiro.
Not much time.	Ma aha waqti badan.
Everything is fine.	Wax walba waa fiican yihiin.
It can be done	Waa la samayn karaa
I don't like lies	been ma jecli
Let me work on it.	Aan ka shaqeeyo.
In fact, this is not true.	Dhab ahaantii, tani run maaha.
Much of that.	In badan oo taas ah.
But it is really that.	Laakiin dhab ahaan waa taas.
I thought he would go.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu tagi doono.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma hayo.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
I know that, now.	Waan ogahay taas, hadda.
He left to find a job elsewhere.	Wuu ka tagay si uu shaqo uga helo meel kale.
Very small.	Mid aad u yar.
And so on.	Iyo wixii la mid ah inta kale.
That would do.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad uga qurux badan tahay.
But it was a lot of fun.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax badan oo xiiso leh.
She did not want him to leave.	Ma ay rabin inuu tago.
But it needs to be no more.	Laakiin waxay u baahan tahay si aanay mar dambe noqon.
I wanted to see.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko.
No one does that.	Qofna taas ma sameeyo.
It may not be true for you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan run kuu ahayn.
This will be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
He is there.	Meesha ayuu joogaa.
He has no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma leh.
This is definitely not a good idea.	Tani dhab ahaantii fikrad wanaagsan maaha.
I look forward to seeing you !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan arko!.
I thought he would be fine.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu fiicnaan doono.
What happened to you? 	Maxaa kaa galay?
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
He has not yet left	Wali ma bixin
Not sure, really.	Ma hubo, runtii.
I thought we were friends.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan nahay saaxiibo.
That is what he wanted.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabay.
They will pay.	Way bixin doonaan.
Only you and I want it.	Adiga iyo adiga kaliya ayaa doona.
I really knew that.	Runtii taas waan ogaa.
Everything will do.	Wax kasta ayaa qaban doona.
There is nothing we can do.	Wax aan qaban karno ma jiraan.
And you will get it.	Oo waad heli doontaa.
There is nothing more or less.	Wax kale iyo wax ka yar ma jiraan.
Everyone seemed happy.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqday inuu faraxsan yahay.
But you will definitely get better.	Laakiin runtii waad fiicnaan doontaa.
He desperately wants to be one of us.	Wuxuu rabaa si xun inuu naga mid noqdo.
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
I love work	Waan jeclahay shaqada
But what happened, it happened.	Laakiin maxaa dhacay, waa dhacay.
It would be.	Wuu ahaan lahaa.
But it did not help.	Laakiin ma caawin.
No problem.	Dhib ma leh.
I thought they would go.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tagi doonaan.
I will fall.	Waan iska dhici doonaa.
Not a bad idea.	Maaha fikrad xun.
Not as it should be.	Ma aha sida ay tahay.
I do not see him happy.	Ma arko isaga oo faraxsan.
I saw that.	Waan arkay taas.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
He is not home yet.	Weli guriga ma uu joogin.
But that is what is happening here.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa halkan ka socda.
Everyone knows it now.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa hadda.
I didn't want to talk.	Ma rabin inaan hadlo.
Maybe I didn't think so.	Malaha sidaas uma malaynayn.
I know everything.	Wax walba waan ogahay.
So does everyone.	Sidaas oo kale qof walba.
This is the only thing she can do.	Tani waa waxa kaliya ee ay sameyn karto.
It can do better than that.	Way samayn kartaa wax ka wanaagsan taas.
He was a really good man.	Runtii nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
As of now.	Sida hadda.
You did that.	Adiga ayaa taas ka dhigay.
I wanted someone else to know.	Waxaan rabay in qof kale ogaado.
Please do not talk to me, now.	Fadlan ha ila hadlin, hadda.
I should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si fiican u ogaado.
But that can't be a bad thing.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto wax xun.
I would like	waan jeclaan lahaa
But it is him.	Laakiin waa isaga.
I don’t see anything else we can do now.	Ma arko wax kale oo aan hadda samayn karno.
Today was a great day.	Maanta waxay ahayd maalin aad u weyn.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
No one knew what could be done.	Qofna ma ogayn waxa la samayn karo.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karto.
I still can't say anything.	Weli waxba ma odhan karo.
Is that small?	Taasi ma wax yar baa?
I'm sorry about everything.	Waan ka xumahay wax walba.
But they are.	Laakiin waxay yihiin.
And this would be.	Oo tani waxay noqon lahayd.
And it can be anything.	Oo waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
This was why he was one of my favorite people.	Tani waxay ahayd sababta uu u ahaa mid ka mid ah dadka aan jeclahay.
That can help.	Taasi way ku caawin kartaa.
This is more fun	Tani waa ka xiiso badan
He didn't want to talk.	Ma uu rabin inuu hadlo.
Really amazing things.	Runtii waxyaabo yaab leh.
What do you think.	Maxaa kula tahay.
I felt a bit like that.	Waxaan dareemay xoogaa sidaas oo kale ah.
Tell me why.	Waxaad ii sheeg sababta.
Another reason is that it is not needed.	Sababta kale ayaa ah in aan loo baahnayn.
I really did.	Runtii waan sheegay.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
No one really wants anyone to know who they really are.	Qofna runtii ma rabo in qofna ogaado cidda ay dhab ahaantii yihiin.
I refused to be anything other than myself.	Waxaan diiday inaan noqdo wax aan aniga ahayn.
Really? 	Runtii?
you said.	waxaad tidhi.
I do not.	Ma samaynayo .
It's a lot of work.	Waa shaqo badan.
I actually went there.	Runtii halkaas ayaan aaday.
I want to tell you more.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan kuu sheego.
No one did.	Qofna wuu sameeyay.
He was always a little surprised.	Mar walba wuu yara yaabay.
He started a new diet.	Waxa uu bilaabay cunto cusub.
I have no one.	Qofna ma hayo.
There was not much.	Wax badan ma jirin.
Not me.	Aniga sidaas maaha.
He doesn’t have to have much.	Ma aha in uu wax badan haysto.
That she did.	In ay samaysay.
Maybe he's gone now, it would be better.	Malaha wuu tagay hadda, way fiicnaan lahayd.
They will do something with money	Waxay wax ku samayn doonaan lacag
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
You know you belong to me.	Waad ogtahay inaad aniga ila leedahay.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Waxaan rabaa inaad sameyso waxaad rabto inaad sameyso.
Good job, if you can get it.	Shaqo wanaagsan, haddii aad heli karto.
I came back	waan soo noqday
I don't know where she is now.	Ma garanayo meel ay hadda joogto.
I wondered how it was done.	Waxaan la yaabay sida loo sameeyo.
It will be a good day.	Waxay noqon doontaa maalin wanaagsan.
He loves you so much.	Aad buu kuu jecel yahay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
So far, very familiar.	Ilaa hadda, aad loo yaqaan.
They are not free now.	Hadda ma ay lacag la'aan yihiin.
Probably not.	Malaha ma dhici karto.
He loves us very much.	Aad buu noo jecel yahay.
You may not be able to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan awoodin.
He should know.	Waa inuu ogaado.
It was a clear day.	Waxay ahayd maalin cad.
I wish we had more time.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan waqti badan heli lahayn.
I left.	waan ka tagay.
I do a lot.	aad ayaan u sameeyaa.
You can do the same.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax la mid ah.
I still don't have it.	Wali ma hayo.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
I don't know where else.	Meel aan ahayn ma garanayo.
I hold on tight	si adag ayaan u hayaa
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
It is not an opportunity, he was told.	Fursad ma aha, ayaa loo sheegay.
I knew it was true.	Run baan u ogaa.
But they will see.	Laakiin way arki doonaan.
He wanted to know what it was.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado waxay tahay.
You have to do it once.	Waa inaad hal mar samayso.
I had to do what was best for him.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo waxa isaga u wanaagsan.
I can take time, now.	Waqti ayaan qaadan karaa, hadda.
I didn't find anything.	waxba maan helin.
Now he decided it was enough.	Hadda wuxuu go'aansaday inuu ku filan yahay.
I hope you are well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad si fiican u wanaagsan tahay.
If only there was something better.	Haddii kaliya ay jiraan wax ka wanaagsan.
He did not know.	Ma uu garanayn.
If so, you may have to.	Haddii ay jirto, waxaa laga yaabaa inaad leedahay.
That didn't help much.	Taasi wax badan ma caawin.
You will do this first.	Waxaad marka hore samayn doontaa tan.
I will do it	waan samayn doonaa
Here is the same.	Halkan isku mid.
I am really happy to see you.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
I have not seen	Maan arag
You know they can't.	Waad ogtahay inaysan awoodin.
Now, it’s me.	Hadda, waa aniga.
I hope you like the new job.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay shaqada cusub.
That did.	Taasi waxay samaysay.
He was told he was in trouble.	Waxaa loo sheegay in uu dhib ku jiro.
Now nothing more.	Hadda wax ka badan maaha.
It had to be what it was meant to be.	Waxay ahayd inuu noqdo wixii la rabay inuu noqdo.
Most, even, he thought.	Inta badan, xitaa, ayuu u maleeyay.
The bigger it was the better.	Ka weyn ayaa ahaan jiray mid ka sii wanaagsan.
That is true enough.	Taasi waa run ku filan.
No one is here.	Qofna halkan ma jiro.
As you said.	Sida aad sheegtay.
She was ready.	Way diyaar ahayd.
He was a beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan buu ahaa.
Not true	Run maaha
Until he is not.	Ilaa uusan ahayn.
I couldn’t even get that.	Xitaa taas ma aan heli karin.
I want you to know that it is not you.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato inaysan adiga ahayn.
Like me.	Aniga oo kale.
But he did it well.	Laakiin si fiican buu u sameeyay.
But, really, everything had.	Laakiin, run ahaantii, wax kasta ayaa lahaa.
I am really happy about that.	Runtii taas aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I wanted to.	Waan na rabay.
Not sure what is good.	Ma hubo waxa wanaagsan.
Everything, and nothing.	Wax walba, iyo waxba.
It can be done quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaa loo samayn karaa.
Everyone is happy.	Qof kastaa wuu ku faraxsan yahay.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
That is, not now.	Taasi waa, hadda maaha.
But not people.	Laakiin maaha dadka.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
Don't tell me all at once.	Ha ii sheegin dhammaan hal mar.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
But he would come back.	Laakiin wuu soo noqon lahaa.
Definitely a lot.	Dhab ahaantii wax badan.
It does not have to be.	Ma aha inuu noqdo.
We also live here.	Waxaan sidoo kale ku nool nahay halkan.
But more.	Laakiin in ka badan.
For me, nothing is so great.	Aniga ahaan wax sidaas u weyn maaha.
John is a good friend.	John waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
It was nothing to him.	Waxba uma ahayn isaga.
I don't know for sure.	Ma garanayo hubaal.
This is to be seen.	Tani waa in la arko.
I won't talk to you much.	In badan kula hadli maayo.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Ma rabo inuu ila hadlo.
I don't eat that.	Taas ma cuno.
Both are true.	Labaduba waa run.
Very good, very good.	Aad u fiican, aad u fiican.
I'm sure he'll do it with you.	Waan hubaa inuu kula samaynayo.
I'm glad he's gone.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu baxay.
They never came back.	Mar dambe kuma ay soo noqon.
I did the right thing.	Waxaan sameeyay wax sax ah.
It will be like.	Waxay noqon doontaa sida.
But we do not.	Laakiin ma samayno.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.
.	.
I would not have	Maan haysan lahaa
Not yet available.	Wali lama hayo.
I can't say where, exactly.	Ma sheegi karo meel, sax ah.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
He may not even want to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan xitaa rabin.
I have no idea how long that is true.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inta ay taasi run tahay.
It is enough for me.	Way igu filan tahay aniga.
I don't feel anything.	Waxba ma dareemayo.
He is always there.	Mar walba wuu joogaa.
You will see this.	Waxaad ku arki doontaa tan.
To help others.	Si loo caawiyo dadka kale.
I think you can do it	Waxaan filayaa inaad samayn karto
What harm can it do?	Maxaa dhib ah oo ay sameyn kartaa?
He was robbed.	Waa la dhacay.
They may not be present.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan joogin.
It's time to go to work.	Waa markii aad shaqada aadi lahayd.
I haven't had time to do anything for a long time.	Ma aan helin wakhti aan wax ku samayno muddo dheer.
I will love it	waan jeclaan doonaa
It was a great place.	Waxay ahayd meel aad u fiican.
I'm sorry to say they are true.	Waan ka xumahay inaan sheego inay run yihiin.
I will not stop you.	Ku joojin maayo.
He was so bad.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xun.
I can't tomorrow.	Ma awoodo berrito.
you belong to him.	isaga ayaad leedahay.
Please, just do not.	Fadlan, kaliya ha samayn.
Only, it was not.	Kaliya, ma ahayn.
I will not go	Ma tagi doono
I knew that now.	Taas hadda waan ogaa.
I will find him.	waan heli doonaa isaga.
How does he do this?	Sidee buu tan u sameeyaa?
I looked good	si fiican ayaan u eegay
It just won't do.	Kaliya ma yeeli doonto.
This was difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid adag.
I am here with you	halkaan ayaan kula joogaa
But he still had not returned.	Laakiin weli wuu u soo noqon waayay.
That also doesn’t say much.	Taasi sidoo kale wax badan ma odhan.
I don't like people.	Ma jecli dadka.
I can tell	Waan sheegi karaa
While there.	Inta ay jirto.
Only if you do nothing about it.	Kaliya haddii aadan waxba ka qaban.
It was impossible.	Waxay ahayd wax aan dhici karin.
I know her well.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
More to say.	Wax badan in la sheego.
One is to see things as they are.	Mid waa in wax loo arko sida ay yihiin.
I have never been to a man.	Weligay nin uma iman.
A man appeared at the door.	Nin baa albaabka ka soo muuqday.
I am very happy to be here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo.
The new one.	Kan cusub.
That he really loves.	In uu runtii jecel yahay.
I am here for you	waan kuu joogaa
But they did not know that.	Laakiin taas ma ay ogayn.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
It would be nice if you could help me.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii aad i caawin lahayd.
What will happen to you?	Maxaa kugu dhici doona?
Stop as much, stop as much as you need.	Jooji wax badan, jooji inta aad u baahan tahay.
He went out to help.	Wuxuu u baxay si uu u caawiyo.
Not so with me.	Aniga sidaas maaha.
Everyone would be somewhere else.	Qof walba meel kale ayuu u ahaan lahaa.
Idont want.	Ma doonayo.
It is again.	Waa mar kale.
One came out of the other.	Mid baa ka soo baxay inta kale.
I was with the former.	Waxaan la joogay kii hore.
He does not want to be known, he said.	Ma rabto in lagu ogaado, ayuu yidhi.
No one can see me.	Qofna ima arki karo.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
Until they are what you are.	Ilaa ay yihiin waxa aad tahay.
You should not do it, but you can not help.	Waa inaadan samayn, laakiin ma caawin kartid.
Everyone was there.	Qof kastaa wuu joogay.
They love him there.	Waxay ku jecel yihiin isaga halkaas.
He didn't want to talk.	Ma uu rabin inuu hadlo.
And so he.	Oo sidaas ayuu.
I do not like to lie.	Ma jecli inaan been sheego.
That was, he saw it now.	Taasi waxay ahayd, hadda wuu arkay.
I need you to know something.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad wax ogaato.
We would be.	Waxaan noqon lahayn.
You do not have to	Uma baahnid
But he came back.	Laakiin wuu soo noqday.
But now, he wanted more.	Laakiin hadda, wax badan ayuu rabay.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
It is done.	Waxaa loo sameeyaa.
That was awful !.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun!.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
People will tell me they are sorry.	Dadka ii sheegi doona inay ka xun yihiin.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa mid adag.
He looked elsewhere.	Meel kale ayuu u muuqday.
No one said.	Qofna ma odhan.
I didn't have time for homework.	Waqti uma helin shaqada guriga.
I was surprised to find it there.	Waxaan la yaabay inaan halkaas ka helay.
She is as happy as she can be.	Way ku faraxsan tahay sida ay noqon karto.
But they had nothing to do.	Laakiin ma ay lahayn wax soo socda.
That was very difficult.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
I have no idea what she has.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay leedahay.
You are selfish.	Waxaad tahay qof iska jecel.
it does nothing.	waxba ma sameeyo.
Really, really smart.	Runtii, runtii caqli badan.
I hurried back.	Degdeg ayaan dib ugu noqday.
Surely you have done this before.	Hubaal inaad tan hore u samaysay.
It would be nice to see that.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in la arko taas.
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
But everything is nothing.	Laakiin wax walba waa wax aan waxba ahayn.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I was there	halkaas ayaan joogay
It would not do	Ma yeeli lahayn
That is true.	Taasi waa runtii.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
They did not need it.	Uma ay baahnayn.
I will only be here for one year.	Waxaan halkaan joogi doonaa kaliya hal sano.
After all, it wasn’t as bad as it looked.	Ka dib oo dhan, ma ahayn mid aad u xun sida ay u egtahay.
Ah but it is good.	Ah laakiin waa fiican.
This will take a lot of work.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa shaqo badan.
I think the job is good for him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in shaqada isaga u fiican.
It's good that she didn't see me.	Waa wax wanaagsan inay i arki wayday.
I want to know who did this.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda tan samaysay.
It's as good as it gets.	Way u fiican tahay sida ay tahay.
She realized she could not do that.	Way ogaatay inaysan taas samayn karin.
I'll do it here.	Waxaan ku qaban doonaa halkan.
It should not have been so.	Ma ahayn in sidaas la sameeyo.
It will not be interesting.	Wax xiiso leh ma noqon doonto.
How could we not be friends.	Sidee laga yaabaa inaan saaxiibo noqon lahayn.
I refused to return.	Waan diiday inaan noqdo.
I know you need a job.	Waan ogahay inaad shaqo u baahan tahay.
It needs to be known.	Waxaa loo baahan yahay in la ogaado.
But he did not say.	Laakiin ma uu odhan.
That would be the worst thing we could do.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd waxa ugu xun ee aan sameyn karno.
For a long time, I did not see it.	Waqti dheer, ma arag.
he knows you.	wuu ku garanayaa.
I had never been there before.	Weligay ma aanan joogin halkaas ka hor.
I can't say anything else.	Wax kale uma sheegi karo.
It can be a big job for him.	Waxay u noqon kartaa shaqo weyn isaga.
Befriend him.	La saaxiib isaga.
There is nothing you can do.	Wax aad qaban karto ma jirto.
Definitely enough, he was.	Hubaal ku filan, wuxuu ahaa.
It would never happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici lahayd.
I wish he could.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu awoodo.
I really know this now.	Run ahaantii hadda waan ogahay tan.
Good day!	Maalin wanaagsan!
More time.	Waqti badan.
He saw.	Wuu arkay.
He can see very well.	Aad ayuu wax u arki karaa.
Everyone loves it.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay.
I can't see anything.	Waxba ma arki karo.
I need you to do something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad wax sameyso
What a man.	Waa maxay nin.
It was to be found.	Waxay ahayd in la helo.
There is so much to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan in la sameeyo.
I need some time.	Waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa waqti ah.
There is no one like you.	Ma jiro mid adiga oo kale ah.
I didn’t want to tell him how good it was for him.	Ma aanan rabin in aan u sheego sida ay ugu wanaagsan tahay isaga.
there is	waxaa jira
I did not want anyone to see me.	Ma rabin in qofna i arko.
I am with you	waan kula joogaa
Now you can talk to him about what you need.	Hadda waxaad kala hadli kartaa isaga waxaad u baahan tahay.
Apparently he wanted to get out of there.	Waxa cad in uu rabay in uu halkaas ka baxo.
I could not figure out why.	Waan awoodi waayay inaan ogaado sababta.
He did not want to part with her.	Ma uu rabin in uu kala tago.
That was true, for sure.	Taasi run bay ahayd, hubaal.
Maybe, but not soon.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, laakiin ma aha waqti dhow.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
That was one.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid.
You do not need any of us.	Uma baahnid mid naga mid ah.
That was clear enough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid cad oo ku filan.
And it is not over yet.	Oo weli ma ay dhammaan.
And it really is, much better.	Oo runtii waa, inta ka sii wanaagsan.
Like anything school.	Sida wax dugsiga.
But there was something better.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka sii fiican.
You will find us.	Waad naga heli doontaa.
For me, it’s something else.	Aniga ahaan, waa wax kale.
I just don’t know what to get.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxaan helo.
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
This should not take long.	Tani waa inaysan qaadan waqti dheer.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
I have people.	Waxaan leeyahay dadka.
I know what that looks like.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u egtahay.
had beautiful things.	lahaa waxyaabo qurux badan.
I didn’t think anyone else was living here.	Uma malaynayn in qof kale halkan ku nool yahay.
The former does not.	Kan hore ma doono.
He never did.	Mar ma uu samayn.
It would be nice if you could do that, really.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii aad taas samayn lahayd, runtii.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
And now this.	Oo hadda kan.
A little trouble.	Dhibaato yar.
But you did.	Laakiin waad samaysay.
I think the latter is better.	Waxaan filayaa in kan dambe uu ka wanaagsan yahay.
He is here	Wuu joogaa halkan
Someone will come.	Qof baa iman doona.
Well out.	Si fiican u soo baxay.
I still mostly do.	Weli inta badan waan sameeyaa.
I want to work for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kuu shaqeeyo
You can leave for a very long time.	Waxaad ka bixi kartaa muddo aad u dheer.
A lot really.	Wax badan runtii.
He gave me a job when no one else did.	Waxa uu i siiyay shaqo marka qof kale uusan sameyn.
No one.	Qofna ma aha.
But he was really the same man.	Laakiin runtii nin la mid ah buu ahaa.
At work	Shaqada
Don't think it can't happen here.	Ha u malayn in aanay halkan ka dhici karin.
Let me do it.	Aan sameeyo.
Perhaps the best has yet to come.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tan ugu wanaagsan ay weli iman.
That is the way it is with any job.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay shaqo kasta.
There was more, too.	Waxaa jiray wax ka badan, sidoo kale.
I had a good idea.	Waxaan lahaa fikrad fiican.
I knew she would do it.	Waan ogaa inay samayn doonto.
Tell them.	U sheeg.
You know you will.	Waad ogtahay inaad sameyn doonto.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
Do nothing else.	Wax kale ha samayn.
But now no problem.	Laakiin hadda dhib ma leh.
I did not go.	Maan tagin.
I really liked him.	Aad iyo aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
Not all.	Ma dhammaan.
I have nowhere to go.	Meel aan aado ma jirto.
He just thinks it's the best.	Kaliya wuxuu u maleynayaa inay tahay tan ugu fiican.
You can stop.	Waad joojin kartaa.
Which is good for me.	Taas oo aniga ila fiican.
There were things to do.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo la samayn lahaa.
There is no certainty.	Wax la hubo ma jiro.
No one can do it.	Qofna kuma samayn karo.
The main thing for him was that he really wanted to learn.	Waxa ugu weyn isaga waa inuu runtii rabay inuu wax barto.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
What happened tonight.	Maxaa dhacay caawa.
Just tell her how it is.	Kaliya u sheeg sida ay tahay.
That is it.	Taasi waa taas.
But he knew very little about it.	Laakiin wax yar ayuu ka ogaa.
But that is not how to get there.	Laakiin maaha sida loo tago halkaas.
Not much.	Ma aha wax badan.
I think this is what follows.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay waxa soo socda.
I would prefer this over everything.	Waxaan ka jeclaan lahaa tan wax kasta.
Everything that would have happened would have happened here.	Wax kasta oo dhici lahaa ayaa halkan ka dhici lahaa.
It will be fine.	Way ku fiicnaan doontaa.
And there was none.	Oo ma jirin.
But obviously, this is not true.	Laakiin sida iska cad, run maaha.
I really hope it works well.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inuu si fiican u shaqeeyo.
I saw.	Waan arkay.
That is why it still works.	Taasi waa sababta uu weli u shaqeeyo.
Lots of cars.	Baabuur badan.
He wanted me to stay.	Wuxuu rabay inaan joogo.
Lots of interesting things to see.	Waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh oo la arko.
I am happy today.	Waan faraxsanahay maanta.
I think this is the reason.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay sababta.
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
That was a good day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin fiican.
It is a good idea if it is one you like.	Waa fikrad fiican haddii ay tahay mid aad jeceshahay.
I was here	halkaan ayaan joogay
We are best friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo isku fiican.
This is now me and you.	Tani hadda waa aniga iyo adiga.
But enough is enough.	Laakiin ku filan ayaa ku filan.
But there was something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jiray.
That's enough for you	Waxa kugu filan
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
This is very small.	Tani waa mid aad u yar.
Only one is available.	Hal kaliya ayaa la heli karaa.
Someone was always in the room with you.	Qof ayaa had iyo jeer qolka kula jiray.
Lots more here.	Wax badan oo halkan ah.
I had no luck there.	Wax nasiib ah uma helin halkaas.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I was not at first.	Maan ahayn marka hore.
I have never done such a big thing before.	Weligay mid sidaas u weyn ka hor ma samayn.
They are too big.	Aad bay u weyn yihiin.
But she refused.	Laakiin been bay diiday.
It would take time.	Waxay qaadan lahayd wakhti.
Take it, take it, take it!	Qaado, qaado, qaado!
I do not know why, exactly.	Ma garanayo sababta, dhab ahaan.
Once he was someone else.	Mar wuxuu ahaa qof kale.
Also a bit.	Sidoo kale xoogaa.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I just didn’t know exactly what she was doing.	Kaliya maan garanayn si sax ah waxay samaynayso.
How that will happen.	Sida ay taasi dhici doonto.
He refused to talk to us.	Wuu diiday inuu nala hadlo.
I do not know where he is.	Ma garanayo meel uu joogo.
Not too big.	Aad uma weyn.
I'm sorry, but.	Waan ka xumahay, laakiin.
He should have come back now.	Waxay ahayd inuu hadda soo noqdo.
She missed that.	Way wayday taas.
Runtii.	Runtii.
There is nothing harder than that.	Ma jiro wax ka adag taas.
He is present once and everywhere.	Hal mar ayuu joogaa iyo meel walba.
Another great man.	Nin weyn oo kale.
When he is good, he is really good.	Marka uu wanaagsan yahay, runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I know it's a lie.	Waan ogahay inay been tahay.
I will be ready.	Waxaan noqon doonaa diyaar.
They are still friends.	Weli waa saaxiibo.
You are right.	Si sax ah ayaad u sheegtay.
No one said anything.	Qofna wax uu sheego ma jirin.
I know he knew.	Waan ogahay inuu ogaa.
I didn't want to tell him.	Maan rabin inaan u sheego.
Who is not supposed to stay here until late.	Yaa aan loo malaynayn inuu halkan joogo ilaa goor dambe.
I will be there shortly.	Wax yar ka dib ayaan halkaas joogi doonaa.
I know this very well.	Aad ayaan ugu ogahay taas.
If you can help.	Haddii aad caawin karto.
Well done	Si fiican u socda
He who knows does not speak.	Kii yaqaan ma hadlo.
That is a real problem right now.	Taasi waa dhibaato dhab ah hadda.
There was to be more.	Waxay ahayd in wax badan la helo.
Everyone wants to know something.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu wax ka ogaado.
It could not be done.	Waa la qaban waayay.
We do not have to do this.	Ma aha inaan samayno tan.
So far, he says, too.	Ilaa hadda, wuxuu leeyahay, sidoo kale.
I can take it	waan qaadan karaa
I am not one of them.	Ma aha wax aan ka mid ahay.
Let me know more about that.	Aan wax badan ka ogaado taas.
She will find a new person.	Waxay heli doontaa qof cusub.
And not well.	Oo aan si fiican.
Not you, obviously.	Ma aha adiga, iska cad.
Maybe you will.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad noqon doonto.
This is nothing new.	Tani ma aha wax cusub.
I did not think so.	Ma malaynayn.
Love it, I'm really sorry.	Jeclahay, runtii waan ka xumahay.
It looks like you want more.	Waxay u egtahay inaad rabto wax badan.
All he had to do was.	Waxa kaliya ee uu samayn lahaa ayaa ahaa.
And in trouble.	Oo dhib ku jira.
This is a very interesting idea.	Tani waa fikrad aad u xiiso badan.
I have never seen him.	Weligay ma arag isaga.
It's true.	Waa run.
Same idea, really.	Fikrad la mid ah, runtii.
I felt	Waxaan dareemay
He really is.	Runtii wuu yahay.
I did not say that but it was definitely true.	Taas ma odhan laakiin waxay ahayd hubaal inay run tahay.
But for others.	Laakiin dadka kale.
What do you think we can do?	Maxaad u malaynaysaa inaan sameyn karno?
I thought you would like it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeclaan lahayd.
Unable to eat.	Aan awoodin in uu cunto cuno.
There is nothing there.	Waxba meesha ma jiraan.
As you were.	Sida aad ahayd.
If you would like something here, please let me know	Haddii aad halkan wax jeceshahay, fadlan ii soo sheeg
She was right.	Sax bay ahayd.
I wanted something better for him.	Waxaan rabay isaga wax ka wanaagsan.
I'll talk to you later	dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa
It should look very good.	Waa inuu u muuqdaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
It is difficult to ignore that.	Way adag tahay in laga tago taas.
You are definitely lucky.	Waxaa hubaal ah inaad nasiib leedahay.
Maybe it was new.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd mid cusub.
To do as much as you like.	Inaad sameyso wax badan oo aad jeceshahay.
No one could see it.	Qofna ma arki karin.
You will stay still.	Waad joogi doontaa weli.
You would like to greatly appreciate it.	Waxaad jeclaan lahayd inaad si weyn u jeceshahay.
They did nothing.	Waxba uma ay samayn.
Hold on tight.	Si adag u qabo.
Just like everyone else.	Kaliya la mid ah dadka kale.
He did not understand.	Ma uu fahmin.
I know he is there.	Waan ogahay inuu halkaas ku jiro.
That 's amazing, isn't it?	Taasi waa wax la yaab leh, miyaanay ahayn?
I really wasn't.	Runtii ma aanan ahayn.
you were right	sax baad ahayd
He should still be here.	Waa inuu weli halkan joogo.
I will not return.	soo noqon maayo.
But only so far.	Laakiin kaliya ilaa hadda.
He broke up.	Wuu kala tagay.
I will take it	waan qaadan doonaa
Someone was there.	Qof baa meesha joogay.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa mid adag.
He wanted to keep us.	Wuxuu rabay inuu na haysto.
She should have known more.	Waxay ahayd inay wax badan ka ogaato.
You can help me here.	Waxaad iga caawin kartaa halkan.
No one talked much.	Qofna wax badan kama hadlin.
No one else saw it.	Qof kale ma uu arag.
That is.	Taas oo ah.
He did not go.	Ma uusan tagin.
A lot has happened today.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa maanta dhacay.
I can really see that.	Runtii taas waan arki karaa.
Maybe that's why.	Malaha taasi waa sababta.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxa dhici doona.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
You have good friends here.	Waxaad halkan ku leedahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Please, do not stop now.	Fadlan, hadda ha joojin.
I left everything to chance.	Wax walba fursad ayaan uga tagay.
It was not too late.	Ma ahayn goor dambe.
It is still true today.	Wali waa dhab maanta.
I couldn't do it	Waan qaban waayay
I picked it up.	Waan soo qaaday.
That is why he wants to do it.	Taasi waa sababta uu u doonayo inuu sameeyo.
That is not true now.	Taasi hadda run maaha.
He said he heard something.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu wax maqlay.
He is still a man.	Weli waa nin.
Now, that was a lot of truth.	Hadda, taasi waxay ahayd wax badan oo run ah.
I took it.	Waan qaaday.
There is not enough.	Ma jiraan wax ku filan.
You did this, he said.	Waxaad samaysay tan, ayuu yidhi.
I looked back here.	Waxaan dib u eegay halkan.
That may not be true!	Taasi run ma noqon karto!
A little time.	Waqti yar.
He made it.	Wuu ka dhigay.
But it is a big lie.	Laakiin waa been weyn.
Always had.	Had iyo jeer lahaa.
He is very good at what he does.	Aad ayuu ugu fiican yahay waxa uu sameeyo.
I want to work on it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka shaqeeyo.
But I wouldn’t say, I can’t say.	Laakiin ma odhan lahaa, ma odhan karo.
It is the same for everyone.	Waa isku mid qof walba.
he was not ready.	diyaar uma ahayn.
You can see it here.	Waxaad ka arki kartaa halkan.
But I will.	Laakiin waan sameyn doonaa.
He was not a happy man.	Ma ahayn nin faraxsan.
Need now.	Baahan hadda.
It is the best place to do it.	Waa meesha ugu fiican ee lagu sameeyo.
Something happened early tonight, they don't believe me.	Wax baa dhacay goor hore oo caawa ah, ima ay rumaysan yihiin.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi sidaas maaha.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
There is.	Waxaa jira.
I think that was me.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi aniga ahayd.
That's what he does.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyo.
This can be very difficult.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
Ah, him.	Ah, isaga.
There was nothing to do.	Ma jirin wax la sameeyo.
There was the other.	Waxaa jiray kan kale.
I went tonight.	Caawa ayaan tagay.
That doesn't matter.	Taasi waxba maaha.
I went and did.	waan tagay oo sameeyay.
He was hit by a car.	Waxaa ku dhacay baabuur.
And good food.	Iyo cunto wanaagsan.
He was before.	Hore ayuu ahaa.
I'm not doing anything wrong.	Wax xun ma samaynayo.
He saw her as happy at best.	Waxa uu u arkay in ay ku faraxsan tahay sida ugu fiican.
The same is true of others.	Sidoo kale dadka kale waa sidaas oo kale.
And there is nothing to eat.	Oo ma jiraan wax la cuno.
Near there, now.	Ku dhow halkaas, hadda.
I knew you would come.	Waan ogaa inaad iman doonto.
Certainly there is.	Hubaal inuu jiro.
I'm sure I need it.	Waxaan hubaa inaan u baahanahay.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
He did everything.	Wax walba wuu sameeyay.
He looked good.	Si fiican buu u eegay.
Not many, but few.	Ma badna, laakiin dhowr.
That was a good time.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti fiican.
If not, it will be.	Haddii aysan jirin, way ahaan doontaa.
I know what he wants and what he needs.	Waan ogahay waxa uu rabo iyo waxa uu u baahan yahay.
No one really talked.	Runtii qofna kama hadlin.
But I will not stay there.	Laakiin halkaas kuma sii joogi doono.
But he says.	Laakiin wuu leeyahay.
Three years have passed.	Saddex sano ayaa la sameeyay.
I want you to be here with me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan ila joogto.
No one wants it.	Qofna ma doonayo.
I did not know how bad it was.	Ma garanayn sida uu u xun yahay.
He was not present.	Ma joogin.
She certainly could not see me.	Hubaal way i arki wayday.
I don't think it will take long.	U malayn maayo inay wakhti dheer qaadan doonto.
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
There is nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la sameeyo ma jiraan.
Don't they need more money for more food?	Miyaanay u baahnayn lacag badan cunto badan?.
She looks very good to him.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican isaga.
Good food, too.	Cunto wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
Now, someone had.	Hadda, qof baa lahaa.
This and more.	Tani iyo wax ka badan.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
I am nothing now.	Hadda waxba ma ihi.
And how to get it.	Iyo sida loo helo.
I will discuss the latter.	Tan dambe ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
He knew what was to come.	Wuu ogaa waxa iman doona.
Whatever it is, it will get better.	Wax kasta oo ay tahay, way fiicnaan doontaa.
But it is beautiful.	Laakiin way qurux badan tahay.
He must have something interesting.	Waa inuu leeyahay wax xiiso leh.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan in la sameeyo.
Which is not a good thing.	Taas oo aan ahayn wax wanaagsan.
She had to tell him.	Waxay ahayd inuu u sheego.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
Soon, it will be.	Dhawaan, waxay noqon doontaa.
It's a problem.	Waa dhibaato.
you did not see anything.	waxba ma aadan arag.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
I thought he was very lucky.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu aad u nasiib badan yahay.
I tried.	Waan isku dayay.
And 'a lot' of very interesting that.	Iyo 'wax badan' oo aad u xiiso badan taas.
It was as she said.	Waxay ahayd sidii ay tidhi.
Good opportunity.	Fursad wanaagsan.
No one likes someone who is good at everything.	Qofna ma jecla qofka wax walba ku wanaagsan.
Here again, it is the same idea.	Halkan mar kale, waa fikrad isku mid ah.
I also don’t think you will need it.	Sidoo kale uma maleynayo inaad u baahan doonto.
I can do that better than he can.	Taas waan samayn karaa si ka fiican inta uu awoodo .
He is not a good man.	Ma aha nin wanaagsan.
I suspect no one wants to.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in qofna uu doono.
I heard what you did.	Waxaan maqlay waxaad samaysay.
They love it so much.	Aad bay u jecel yihiin.
Everything is ready.	Wax walba waa diyaar.
Like a man.	Sida nin.
It was just one.	Waxay ahayd hal kaliya.
Nothing stopped.	Waxba ma joojin.
It was just beautiful.	Waxay ahayd kaliya qurux.
Take another.	Mid kale qaado.
Here is someone who will help you.	Waa kan qof ku caawin doona.
He has already done this.	Mar hore ayuu tan sameeyay.
They do not do much.	Aad u badan ma sameeyaan.
Like, it’s really hard.	Sida, runtii waa mid adag.
But there is still something else.	Laakiin weli wax kale ayaa jira.
Maybe she still does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli sameyso.
But he could not see anything.	Laakiin waxba ma uu arki karin.
Said a man.	Nin baa yidhi.
I want that now.	Taas hadda ayaan rabaa.
I don't think anything else.	Wax kale uma malaynayo.
He would stay now.	Hadda wuu joogi lahaa.
Everything he did is right.	Waxa uu sameeyay oo dhan waa sax.
After everyone saw it all.	Ka dib markii qof kastaa arkay dhammaan.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa waxa aad u adag.
Like, really hard.	Sida, runtii adag.
I will pay for everything.	Waxaan bixin doonaa wax kasta.
This was not him.	Tani ma ahayn isaga.
He always does.	Mar kasta wuu sameeyaa.
I just didn’t understand.	Kaliya ma fahmin.
No one came out.	Qofna uma soo bixin.
What he did he could not believe.	Waxa uu sameeyay wuu rumaysan waayay.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
Do not tell anyone what is really going on.	Cidna ha u sheegin waxa run ahaantii socda.
A little bit.	Xoogaa yar.
I know you can't help yourself.	Waan ogahay inaadan is caawin karin.
Everyone is very happy to work with.	Qof kastaa aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay inuu la shaqeeyo.
Three times more.	Saddex jeer ayaa ka badan.
Maybe you are the same.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad isku mid tahay.
I am so glad to see you!	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko!
A man came in.	Nin baa soo galay.
And here's a little, you know.	Oo halkan yar, waad ogtahay.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
He came.	Wuu yimid.
It may be a little too much for that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xoogaa aad u yar ka yar tahay taas.
This is for you for sure.	Tani waa adiga oo la hubaa.
It was a little white and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid yar oo cad oo qurux badan.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
We have not discussed it yet.	Ilaa hadda ma wada hadlin.
It is true.	Way run tahay.
And you know, you're the same.	Oo waxaad ogaatay, inaad isku mid tahay.
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
I really like him.	Runtii waan jeclahay isaga.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Malaha waa wax wanaagsan.
I bought another.	Mid kale ayaan iibsaday.
He fell behind.	Dib buu u dhacay.
There is not much you can do about it.	Wax badan oo aad ka qaban karto ma jiraan.
One is new.	Mid waa cusub.
But even here.	Laakiin xitaa halkan.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
No one can see you here	Qofna kuma arki karo halkan
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I really enjoyed that.	Aad ayaan uga helay taas.
It's smart, it's hard to know what is true.	Way caqli badan tahay, way adag tahay in la ogaado waxa run ah.
It looks like money.	Waxay u egtahay lacag.
I did well	si fiican ayaan sameeyay
As perhaps.	Sida laga yaabo.
This is a long time ago.	Tani waa waqti dheer ka hor.
I will not say.	Ma sheegi doono.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
I will do that for you	Taas ayaan kuu samayn doonaa
Something happened to him.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
Very, very big.	Aad iyo aad u weyn.
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
He knew a lot.	Wax badan buu ogaa.
I have to talk to him.	Waa inaan la hadlo isaga.
What could be seen was nothing more.	Waxa la arki lahaa ma ahayn wax kale.
He was refused to do so.	Waa la diiday in uu sidaas oo kale sameeyo.
But you can't take that.	Laakiin taas ma qaadan kartid.
He can speak, but he does not speak.	Wuu hadli karaa, laakiin ma hadlo.
And now it is again.	Oo hadda waa mar kale.
We had to do the same.	Waxay ahayd inaan sidaas oo kale samayno.
I never did that.	Weligay taas ma samayn.
It was a good thing, he thought.	Waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan, ayuu u maleeyay.
He does not want to leave.	Ma rabo inuu baxo.
I can speak	waan ku hadli karaa
He refused to come.	Wuu diiday inuu yimaado.
It's hard for me.	Way igu adag tahay.
I can't do anything about this.	Waxba kama samayn karo tan.
In fact, it will not happen.	Dhab ahaantii, ma dhici doonto.
I did it again.	Mar kale ayaan sameeyay.
It is so beautiful there.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay halkaas.
That is the most common.	Taasi waa tan ugu badan.
I really like everything.	Runtii wax walba waan jeclahay.
And with someone.	Oo la galay qof .
Just as we are.	Kaliya sida aan nahay.
Maybe that's right	Malaha waa sax
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
Now, here it is.	Hadda, waa kan.
I hope it is true.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay run tahay.
That is why he was here.	Taasi waa sababta uu halkan u joogay.
I did it clearly.	Waxaan sameeyay si cad.
A lot is going on here.	Wax badan ayaa halkan ka socda.
There was nowhere else.	Ma jirin meel kale.
But it can be very difficult.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
It is not too late.	Ma aha goor dambe.
It is a great opportunity.	Waa fursad weyn.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
Anyone can still say what they want.	Qof kasta weli wuu sheegi karaa wuxuu doono.
Which he was for sure.	Taas oo uu hubaal ahaa .
I wonder if we have the same thing.	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aan wax isku mid nahay.
This is a small place.	Tani waa meel yar.
Not often.	Inta badan ma aha.
He is still there.	Weli wuu joogaa.
But there was so much.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax aad u badan.
Surprisingly, you know.	Waa yaab, waad ogtahay.
I do not want to do anything about it.	Ma doonayo inaan wax ka sameeyo.
You would think.	Waxaad u malayn lahayd.
It's good for that.	Way u fiican tahay sidaas.
But this is also not the case.	Laakiin tani sidoo kale sidaas maaha.
But something still happened to him.	Laakiin weli wax baa isaga ku soo dhacay.
I found one here	Mid baan halkan ku helay
He had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma lahayn.
No problems were found	Wax dhibaato ah lama arag
There is nothing better.	Wax ka fiican ma jiro.
There was no way to do it.	Ma jirin si loo sameeyo.
This has not been seen.	Tan lama arag.
This is what we do.	Tani waa waxa aan samayno.
Great one.	Mid weyn.
But it is the best thing we can do.	Laakiin waa waxa ugu fiican ee aan sameyn karno.
Too many cars.	Baabuur aad u badan.
This is what happened to others.	Tani waa waxa ku dhacay dadka kale.
Indeed, it is.	Runtii, waa.
Everyone looked.	Qof kastaa wuu eegay.
But there is.	Laakiin waxaa jira.
He felt better today.	Waxa uu dareemay maanta in uu fiican yahay.
You were not given a chance.	Wax fursad ah ma aadan siin.
Not much to do, but something.	Ma aha wax badan in la sameeyo, laakiin wax.
What a fun day!	Waa maxay maalin xiiso leh!
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
I happened to be known.	Waxaan u dhacay in la i ogaado.
You did it once.	Mar ayaad samaysay.
I liked her being there.	Waxaan ka helay inay halkaas joogto.
And more than once.	Iyo in ka badan hal mar.
But I can't.	Laakiin ma awoodo.
Like that he was a much younger man.	Sida in uu ahaa nin aad uga yar.
To say the right thing.	In la sheego wax sax ah.
That was quick.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
I do not like	Ma jecli
Now you can do that.	Hadda waad samayn kartaa taas.
Most are laid out.	Inta badan waa la dhigay.
He is happy to be there.	Wuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu halkaas joogo.
I have things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan sameeyo.
But he saw nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma uu arag.
I told you how it is.	Waan kuu sheegay sida ay tahay.
It should not be found.	Waa inaan la helin.
I want to tell them what will happen.	Waxaan rabaa inaan u sheego waxa dhici doona.
Now like the other one.	Hadda sida kan kale.
Now you can go back to work.	Hadda waxaad ku noqon kartaa shaqada.
I have always said so.	Weligay sidaas ayaan odhan jiray.
He just didn’t take it.	Kaliya ma uu qaadan.
They are still a new idea to me.	Wali waxay ii yihiin fikrad cusub.
He did not want to do anything.	Wax uu ku sameeyo ma uu doonayn.
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
It's hard.	Way adag tahay.
That is a lot of work.	Taasi waa shaqo badan.
Very good, you can come if you want.	Aad u fiican, waad iman kartaa haddii aad rabto.
Very early on, but it had to be done.	Aad goor hore tani, laakiin waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
I can't even afford it.	Xitaa ma awoodo.
That will tell you a lot.	Taasi waxay kuu sheegi doontaa wax badan.
I could not say anything.	Waxba ma odhan karin.
I think so.	Sidaas ayaan u maleynayaa .
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
I will never do anything else.	Weligay wax kale ma samayn doono.
But he did it alive.	Laakiin nool wuu sameeyay.
You did it now.	Waxaad samaysay hadda.
I would tell him everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegi lahaa.
He said he was not.	Wuxuu sheegay inuusan ahayn.
But not here, and not now.	Laakiin halkan maaha, iyo hadda maaha.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
If someone can help him, she can definitely.	Haddii qof uu caawin karo isaga, hubaal way awoodi kartaa.
There were other things.	Waxyaabo kale ayaa jiray.
I have that.	taas ayaan hayaa.
He is very smart.	Aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay.
It is there	Waa halkaas
, '.	,'.
It's just.	Waxa kaliya.
I do not understand this.	Ma fahmin tan.
You can see a lot of new stuff now.	Waxaad arki kartaa wax badan oo cusub hadda.
One by one.	Mid mid.
He had no idea this was bad.	Wax fikrad ah kama uusan lahayn inay tani xun tahay.
Not much was said.	Wax badan lama sheegin.
I think she will be back tonight.	Waxaan filayaa inay caawa soo noqon doonto.
I was not at home	Maan joogin guriga
It is me.	Waa aniga.
But it is still there.	Laakiin weli waa la joogaa.
Something similar, really.	Wax la mid ah, runtii.
Something happened.	Wax baa ka dhacay.
You can get it if you want.	Waad heli kartaa haddii aad rabto.
Take as much as you like.	Qaado inta aad jeceshahay.
It's hard to see.	Way adag tahay in la arko.
You are very good anyway.	Aad baad u fiican si kasta.
I don't want it here	halkan kuma rabo
I don't think I can do this.	Uma eka in aan tan samayn karo.
She could do this, she should have done this.	Way samayn kartaa tan, waxay ahayd inay tan samayso.
Now they are friends.	Hadda waa saaxiibo.
That is a bad idea for me.	Taasi aniga waa fikrad xun.
Great idea.	Fikrad weyn.
No big surprise.	La yaab weyn ma leh.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
Take everything you need from me.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay iga qaado.
It has been so far.	Waxay ahayd sidaas ilaa hadda.
I’m sure I really enjoyed it.	Waxaan hubaa in aan aad uga helay.
But there is so much more to do now.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax aad uga badan inuu hadda sameeyo.
This is to be expected.	Tani waa in la filayaa.
Maybe that's it.	Malaha taasi waa.
Would you please do this for me?	Fadlan kan ma ii qaban doontaa?
They will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doonaan.
I do not know exactly how much I will see.	Si sax ah uma garanayo inta aan arki doono.
I refused to do it again.	Waan diiday inaan mar kale sameeyo.
But this is not the case now.	Laakiin tani hadda sidaas maaha.
Everyone was heard.	Qof kastaa waa la maqlay.
Not for a while now.	Ma aha in muddo ah hadda.
You don't need anything!	Waxba uma baahnid!
he knows you.	wuu ku garanayaa.
I am a man from another time.	Waxaan ahay nin waqti kale ka yimid.
I really was.	Runtii waan ahaa.
That's what they had to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
I know it's him.	Waan ogahay inuu isaga yahay.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
I really don't want to know this.	Runtii ma rabo inaan ogaado tan.
It was not an idea he could get.	Ma ahayn fikrad uu heli karo.
I hope you do the same.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso.
I was already there.	Hore ayaan u joogay.
He is not really here	Runtii halkan ma joogo
And keep going.	Oo dib u sii socda.
He was ready for that.	Taas ayuu diyaar u ahaa.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
It's a lot.	Waa wax badan.
It is an old day.	Waa maalin hore.
I don’t want to see this, ever.	Ma rabo inaan tan arko, weligay.
I knew he was out.	Waan ogaa inuu soo baxay.
Always correct three.	Had iyo jeer sax saddex.
I don't want to be.	Ma rabo inaan noqdo.
I can't stay home today.	Ma awoodo inaan maanta guriga joogo.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karaa
You can find him.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa isaga.
Need a place soon	Meel u baahan dhawaan
Still, everyone knows.	Weli, qof kastaa wuu ogyahay.
It is now available	Hadda waa la heli karaa
There really is no way it can be.	Runtii ma jirto si ay u noqon karto.
Not when it would come so far.	Ma aha markii ay iman lahayd ilaa hadda.
That was a thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax.
It could be nothing but beautiful there.	Wax kale ma noqon karo waxaan ka ahayn mid qurux badan halkaas.
He had to do it.	Waxa uu ahaa in uu sameeyo.
It will be great for us in the long run.	Waxay noo noqon doontaa wax weyn waqti dheer oo dheer.
just like you, beautiful.	adiga oo kale, mid qurux badan.
Sometimes he would do it.	Mar mar wuu qaban jiray.
Friend here is new to me.	Saaxiib halkan waa iga sii cusub.
What else could it be.	Maxaa kale oo ay noqon kartaa.
Now.	Hadda.
At its best.	Sida ugu fiican ee.
He will not be able to help.	Ma awoodi doono inuu caawiyo.
There is nothing he would like more.	Wax uu ka jeclaan lahaa ma jiro.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah ma leh.
No one said.	Cidna ma odhan.
Now he knew that.	Hadda wuu ogaa taas.
As if it weren’t a big deal.	Sida haddii aysan ahayn wax weyn.
You are something to be seen.	Waxaad tahay wax la arko.
Everything is fine here, but not very happy.	Wax walba waa ku fiican yihiin halkan, laakiin ma aha mid aad u faraxsan.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
They are good at that.	Way ku fiican yihiin taas.
But it is not as surprising as this.	Laakiin maaha sida tan oo kale la yaab leh.
And ready for you.	Oo kuu diyaar ah.
He became a good friend.	Wuxuu noqday saaxiib wanaagsan.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
You did that.	Waad samaysay taas.
I know everyone is busy.	Waan ogahay in qof kastaa mashquul yahay.
I think that's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run tahay.
More than others.	In ka badan dadka kale.
I did not say.	Ma aan sheegin.
Did he do the right thing? 	Miyuu sameeyay wax sax ah?
Maybe something similar happened here.	Malaha wax la mid ah ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
I'm sure it will happen.	Waan hubaa inay dhici doonto.
No one does, really.	Qofna ma sameeyo, runtii.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
A little is enough.	Wax yar ayaa ku filan.
But you have to be lucky.	Laakiin waa inaad nasiib leedahay.
To do that.	Si taas loo sameeyo.
I will not take it anymore.	Mar dambe ma qaadan doono.
Just too long	Kaliya aad u dheer
We are one of them.	Waxaan ka mid nahay.
He is still very good.	Waxa uu yahay weli waa mid aad u fiican.
Not much, but a few.	Ma aha wax badan, laakiin dhowr.
But this is also not true.	Laakiin tani sidoo kale sax maaha.
Maybe so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas tahay.
I will talk about this soon.	Dhawaan ayaan ka hadli doonaa arrintan.
I can do something for you	wax baan kuu qaban karaa
I saw.	Waan arkay.
I know this is true.	Waan ogahay in tani run tahay.
A few other things we have to do now.	Waxyaabo kale oo yar oo ay tahay inaan hadda samayno.
They both do beautiful things.	Labaduba waxay sameeyaan waxyaabo qurux badan.
I was the same.	Waxaan ahaa isku mid.
This is right for him.	Tani waa sax isaga.
This is amazing.	Tani waa waxyaabo yaab leh.
Very little has been said.	Wax aad u yar baa la yidhi.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
In fact, they are.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay yihiin.
It's not too late, you know.	Ma aha goor dambe, waad ogtahay.
That won't help me, much.	Taasi ima caawin doonto, badan.
He was not a friend.	Ma ahayn saaxiib.
I really do.	runtii waan sameeyaa.
I’ve seen a lot too.	Wax badan ayaan arkay sidoo kale.
That is all true.	Taasi waa run oo dhan.
You will leave here.	Waxaad ka bixi doontaa halkan.
I don't like it here	Ma jecli halkan
Surprised, nothing.	La yaabay, waxba.
It's hard to see.	Way adag tahay in la arko.
I say, too.	Waxaan leeyahay, sidoo kale.
I saw a man who really bought one.	Waxaan arkay nin runtii iibsaday mid.
I am happy for her to be with me.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay ila joogto.
It may not be you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan adiga ahayn.
That's right, that's right.	Waa sax, waa sax.
Please do not take anything from here.	Fadlan halkan waxba ha ka qaadan.
He is here now	Hadda wuu joogaa halkan
Not every day.	Ma aha maalin kasta.
Just tell me.	Kaliya ii sheeg.
They just didn’t tell me.	Kaliya ima ay sheegin.
You are as good as you are.	Waad ku fiican tahay sida aad tahay.
I will help you tomorrow	waan ku caawin doonaa berri
There is nothing to hold on to.	Ma jiraan wax la haysto.
They are very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
So far, so good.	Ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
It is entered.	Waa la galay.
You told me.	Waad ii sheegtay.
Is there anything else? 	Wax kale ma jiraan?
There was something.	Wax baa jiray.
It can be even worse.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad uga xun.
That really is not the case.	Runtii taas maaha.
This is how he wants to do it.	Tani waa sida uu rabo inuu ku sameeyo.
Do you love me? 	Ma i jeceshahay?
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
I don't know what will happen.	Ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
I wanted to do it.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo.
I just say '.	Waxaan kaliya ku leeyahay '.
You need someone like me.	Waxaad u baahan tahay qof aniga oo kale ah.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
No wonder he didn't tell me.	La yaab ma aha in uu ii sheegi waayay.
Interesting, and not surprising.	Xiiso leh, oo aan la yaab lahayn.
I will get it soon.	Waxaan heli doonaa dhawaan.
That is less true now.	Taasi run bay ka yar tahay hadda.
It really didn't matter.	Runtii dhib ma lahayn.
First, that is not true.	Marka hore, taasi run maaha.
If this is true, keep busy	Haddii tani run tahay, mashquul
You may tell me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ii sheegto.
It would be close by.	Waxay ahaan lahayd meel u dhow.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
We are.	Waxaan nahay.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
Just take it.	Kaliya qaado.
It was very good.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
It should not be.	Waa in aanay noqon.
This will not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon doonto.
There was no time.	Wax waqti ah ma jirin.
She still does.	Weli way samaysay.
I have good friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Good	Fiican
But maybe that's just me.	Laakiin malaha taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
Not if you really like what you are doing.	Ma aha haddii aad si dhab ah u jeceshahay waxaad samaynayso.
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
But a little more.	Laakiin wax yar oo kale.
It's a very bad idea.	Waa fikrad aad u xun.
I know right.	Waan ogahay sax.
Tom will do that tomorrow.	Tom wuxuu samayn doonaa taas berrito.
This has been done very well.	Tani si aad u wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
I have to say something.	Waa inaan rabaa inaan wax sheego.
A little while ago.	Wax yar ka hor.
I do it to get it.	Waxaan u sameeyaa si aan u helo.
I am very sorry	aad baan uga xumahay
But this is something new.	Laakiin tani waa wax cusub.
Less is more here.	In ka yar ayaa halkan ka badan.
They live here.	Waxay ku nool yihiin halkan.
It takes a lot of work to do that.	Waxay u baahan tahay shaqo badan si taas loo sameeyo.
I said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
They will no longer be accurate, either.	Mar dambe sax ma noqon doonaan, sidoo kale.
He decided.	Wuu go'aansaday.
It happened a lot.	Aad buu u dhacay.
That is what is required.	Taasi waa waxa la rabo.
She had to lie.	Waxay ahayd inay been sheegto.
So there was a lot of this.	Marka waxaa jiray wax badan oo tan ah.
I really want to do this.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan tan sameeyo.
You just can't do it.	Kaliya ma sameyn kartid.
He really liked it.	Aad ayuu uga helay.
A little.	In yar.
Maybe he too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale.
They did not have it.	Ma ay haysan.
Tell me one.	Mid ii sheeg.
We'll see if he sees you or not.	Waan arki doonaa inuu ku arki doono iyo in kale.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
I wish you didn't say that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaadan sidaas odhan.
And so it was done.	Oo sidaas oo kale ayaa loo sameeyay.
I think it's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
There has always been a lot.	Had iyo jeer wax badan ayaa jiray.
This is very popular.	Tan aad u jecel.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
It's been a while since I've been in it.	Muddo ayaa laga joogaa markii aan ku jiray.
I don't feel the same.	Ma dareemayo inay la mid tahay kan kale.
So far it doesn't look like that.	Ilaa hadda uma eka sidaas.
Certainly not	Waa hubaal inaadan haysan
They are, really.	Waxay yihiin, runtii.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan ayaa dhacay.
It should not be.	Waa inuusan noqon.
This was not what he was supposed to be.	Tani ma ahayn kii la rabay inuu noqdo.
He made me.	Wuu iga dhigay.
She was with him.	Waa la jiray isaga.
In fact, they did not know.	Dhab ahaantii, ma ay garanayn.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
I did not have time for that.	Waqti uma helin taas.
Not until tomorrow.	Ma aha ilaa berri.
I think it is a given.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax la siiyay.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
This is a bad idea.	Tani waa fikrad xun.
I went out and bought it.	Waan baxay oo iibsaday.
You	Adiga
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
But there was more.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
She should not have done it.	Ma ahayn inay samayso.
I decided.	aniga ayaa go'aansaday.
But it was nothing new.	Laakiin ma ahayn wax cusub.
I know she did.	Waan ogahay inay samaysay.
I need to find myself.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan is helo.
It was done some time ago.	Waxa la sameeyay wakhti ka hor.
I have nothing to say to him.	Ma haysto wax uu u sheego.
Not now.	Ma jiro hadda.
That is what he tried to do.	Taasi waa waxa uu isku dayay inuu sameeyo.
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqada aado
That is definitely not the case.	Taasi hubaal maaha.
Even more so now and before.	Xitaa ka sii badan hadda iyo ka hor.
Don't you think we can help?	Miyaadan u malaynayn inaan caawin karno?
You are so lucky to have so many friends.	Aad baad u nasiib badan tahay inaad saaxiibo badan leedahay.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
I just asked you what you want.	Kaliya waxaan ku waydiiyay waxaad rabto.
He looked at me.	I eegay.
It requires hard work.	Waxay u baahan tahay shaqo adag.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
I need someone like that.	Waxaan u baahanahay qof sidaas oo kale ah.
Free for me.	Lacag la'aan aniga.
He does not have to talk to you every day.	Ma aha inuu maalin walba kula hadlo.
And very still.	Oo aad u weli.
Me.	Aniga.
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
But it was the same.	Laakiin waxay ahayd isku mid.

There was not much new.	Wax badan oo cusub ma jirin.
Work, work.	Shaqo, shaqo.
But doing more.	Laakiin wax badan samaynta.
He could do nothing.	Waxba kama uu qaban karin.
We would get a lot of money back.	Waxaan dib u heli lahayn lacag badan.
Not everyone can get everything they want.	Qof kastaa ma heli karo wax kasta oo uu rabo.
I don't know how he knows, but he does.	Ma garanayo sida uu u yaqaan, laakiin wuu ogyahay.
And here it is amazing.	Oo halkan waa yaab.
I was really surprised by this.	Runtii tan ayaan la yaabay.
More than ever.	In ka badan sidii hore.
It was a good thing.	Wax wanaagsan bay ahayd.
It can be seen up.	Waa la arki karaa ilaa.
He was not even a man.	Xitaa nin ma ahayn.
I am happy.	Aniga oo faraxsan.
I know how they do that.	Waan ogahay sida ay taas u sameeyaan.
It’s not just what I am.	Kaliya maaha wax aan ahay.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
You will be close by.	Waxaad joogi doontaa meel u dhow.
But he may not have it.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan haysan.
It was a long and difficult job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo dheer oo dhib badan.
It does not return to him.	Kama noqdo isaga.
I didn't have to tell him.	Ma ahayn inaan u sheego.
Only, that is what is needed.	Kaliya, taasi waa waxa loo baahan yahay.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
If you need anything else, we will let you know.	Haddii aad u baahan tahay wax kale, waanu kuu sheegi doonaa.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Good things, clear things.	Waxyaabo fiican, wax cad.
It was a bad thing to do.	Waxay ahayd wax xun in la sameeyo.
He was great.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u weyn.
I can't see that.	Taas ma arki karo.
But there is something else as well.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax kale sidoo kale.
So does everyone.	Sidaas oo kale qof walba.
I'll tell you how.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa sida.
But he can talk.	Laakiin wuu hadli karaa.
Everyone loves him.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay isaga.
But there is a time and place for everything.	Laakiin waxaa jira waqti iyo meel wax walba.
I think this is true.	Waxay ila tahay inay tani sax tahay.
I need to learn more.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax ka sii barto.
In the same way.	Si la mid ah.
This is all.	Tani waa dhan .
He also had a bit of him, too.	Waxa kale oo uu lahaa xoogaa isaga, sidoo kale.
It will never be difficult.	Weligay ma noqon doono mid adag.
Maybe he doesn't like me.	Malaha waa qof aan i jeclayn.
This is, really, what she wants.	Tani waa, dhab ahaantii, waxa ay rabto.
I think.	Waxaan qabaa.
I love work	Waan jeclahay shaqada
As a younger man, he never understood that.	Sida nin ka yar, waligiis ma uu fahmin taas.
Who will come out on top?	Yaa ku soo bixi doona?.
He was unable to say what it was.	Wuu awoodi waayay inuu sheego waxa ay tahay.
Still better, you can always do it yourself.	Weli waxaa ka sii wanaagsan, mar walba waad samayn kartaa adiga.
He says.	Waxa uu leeyahay.
He can stop at any time.	Wakhti kasta oo uu doono wuu joojin karaa.
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
I do not understand why.	Ma fahmin sababta oo ah sababta.
I can't see	ma arki karo
She actually said it more than once.	Waxay dhab ahaantii tidhi in ka badan hal mar.
Something clear.	Wax cad.
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
He would be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
You did well.	Si fiican ayaad u samaysay.
To help people.	Si dadka loo caawiyo.
Really very difficult.	Runtii aad u dhib badan.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
One is time.	Mid ka mid ah waa waqti.
Very close too.	Aad u dhow sidoo kale.
That is.	Taasi waa.
It would be interesting.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
He will help me find out.	Wuxuu iga caawin doonaa inaan wax ogaado.
Everyone felt it.	Qof kastaa wuu dareemay.
But it will come.	Laakiin way iman doontaa.
No one was here.	Qofna halkaan ma joogin.
You are very lucky.	Aad baad u nasiib badan tahay.
Someone who doesn't want him here.	Qof aan isaga rabin halkan.
That may be the case.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay sidaas oo kale tahay.
If not, you can.	Haddii aysan jirin, waad sameyn kartaa.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
You must not do this.	Waa inaadan samayn tan.
I don't want to.	Ma rabto.
I looked at it hard	Aad baan u eegay
Also,	Sidoo kale,
I never thought it was so bad.	Weligay uma malaynayn inay sidaas u xun tahay.
I heard he was very good.	Waxaan maqlay inuu aad u wanaagsan yahay.
It would be nice to do that.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaad taas sameyso.
He was tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag.
He said he would like that.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu jeclaan lahaa taas.
It's true, it's true.	Waa run, waa run.
This would be.	Tani waxay ahaan lahayd.
Otherwise, he was very good.	Haddii kale, wuxuu ahaa mid aad u fiican.
I felt.	Waxaan dareemay .
If only you could do it.	Haddii aad kaliya samayn karto.
I have food for you	Cunto ayaan kuu hayaa
Now let me go back.	Hadda aan ku noqdo.
I will say it again.	Mar kale ayaan odhan doonaa.
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan ku caawiyo
Ignorance	Caqli la'aan
He would do anything.	Wax walba wuu samayn lahaa.
It doesn't work everywhere.	Meel walba kuma shaqeeyo.
So far no interest.	Ilaa hadda xiiso ma leh.
She could not believe what was happening.	Way rumaysan wayday waxa socda.
But he may not stay long.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan waqti badan joogin.
They are almost identical.	Waxay ku dhow yihiin isku mid.
She had him.	Way lahayd isaga.
I have a place to go.	Waxaan leeyahay meel aan aadi karno.
I know there are a lot of them.	Waan ogahay inay wax badan ka jiraan.
It really should.	Runtii waa inay.
But it won't let him know.	Laakiin ma yeeli doonto in uu ogaado.
But not often.	Laakiin maaha inta badan.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
At first he did not know where he was and why.	Markii hore ma uu garanayn meesha uu joogo iyo sababta.
I think it will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
I wanted to go home	Waxaan rabay inaan aado guriga
But there was more.	Laakiin waxaa jiray in ka badan.
He really liked it.	Aad ayuu uga helay.
As everyone else did.	Sida qof walba sameeyay.
If you don't like it, fine.	Haddii aadan jeclayn, fiican.
He didn't want to do anything to me.	Wax uu igu sameeyo ma uu rabin.
He can go anywhere he wants.	Meesha uu doono ayuu aadi karaa.
I knew this was it.	Waan ogaa in tani ay tahay.
I want to be clear.	Waxaan rabaa inaan si cad u hadlo.
He was now a man.	Hadda nin buu ahaa.
I did it once.	hal mar ayaan sameeyay.
Was it so.	Ma sidaas bay ahayd.
It is a great opportunity.	Waa fursad weyn.
Everything you need.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
A lot would be fine.	Wax badan ayaa fiicnaan lahayd.
But more can be seen here.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa halkan lagu arki karaa.
will be	noqon doona
That's an amazing idea, a new idea.	Taasi waa fikrad yaab leh, fikrad cusub.
Obviously this is not the case.	Sida cad tani maaha wax la mid ah.
That was really true for me.	Runtii taasi run bay ii ahayd.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
That way you can help.	Sidaas ayaad ku caawin kartaa.
But it is there.	Laakiin waa halkaas.
Where it is now.	Halka ay hadda joogto.
I don't have to talk to you.	Ma aha inaan kula hadlo.
Three too many.	Saddex aad u badan.
He can stand in front of anyone.	Wuxuu hor joogi karaa qof kasta.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn kartid.
I don't want this.	Ma doonayo kan.
She could not find it.	Way heli wayday.
It is even bigger than that.	Xitaa way ka weyn tahay taas.
That is because it has.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah waxay leedahay.
Not much to say.	Wax badan oo la sheego maaha.
I have to go	Waa inaan tago
This is one.	Tani waa mid.
It is here again.	Mar dambe waa halkan.
It was like everything else.	Waxay ahayd sida wax kasta oo kale.
I will be with you	waan kula joogi doonaa
I do not know who.	Ma garanayo cidda.
They are more than three to one.	Waxay ka badan yihiin saddex ilaa hal.
He said it was not.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay ahayn.
Most will be lucky.	Inta badan waxay noqon doonaan nasiib.
There was something familiar.	Wax la yaqaan ayaa ka jiray.
And that this can happen several times.	Iyo in tani ay dhici karto dhowr jeer.
I got money like that.	Waxaan helay lacag sidaas oo kale ah.
He knew what to do.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu samayn lahaa.
He would get a good day's work that.	Waxa uu heli lahaa shaqo maalin wanaagsan in.
he could not stop.	wuu joojin waayay.
Now, he thought.	Hadda, wuxuu u maleeyay.
I looked	Waan eegay
The time has not come.	Muddo ma iman.
It was a great meal.	Waxay ahayd cunto aad u fiican.
He found me	Wuu i helay
I expect him to come here soon.	Waxaan filayaa inuu halkan iman doono dhawaan.
He made it clear that he did not want to.	Waxa uu si cad u sheegay in aanu rabin.
I felt it would help me.	Waxa aan dareemay in ay i caawin doonto.
But they could not see him again.	Laakiin mar dambe ma ay arki karin isaga.
It is still there.	Wali waa halkaas.
I need to get a job	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqo helo
It is very good for that.	Aad bay u fiican tahay taas.
Maybe him.	Malaha isaga .
It is one way.	Hal si ayuu u yahay.
Maybe you can help me	Malaha waad i caawin kartaa
That was the most.	Taasi waxay ahayd tan ugu badan.
This was correct.	Tani waxay ahayd mid sax ah.
It is something new.	Waa wax cusub.
No one was present.	Qofna ma joogin.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
I don't know how to help.	Ma garanayo si aan u caawiyo.
They are in trouble.	Dhib bay ku jiraan.
I didn't want anything to do with it.	Ma rabin in wax lagu sameeyo.
He still wanted to work on it.	Weli wuxuu rabay inuu ka shaqeeyo.
Do not stay in one place for too long.	Ha joogin hal meel muddo dheer.
I just had to say.	Kaliya waxay ahayd inaan sheego.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
I had several.	Waxaan lahaa dhowr.
I hope that is not true.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan taasi run ahayn.
Everyone has something to offer.	Qof walba wax buu u leeyahay.
I rejected that.	Taas waan diiday.
It is enough for me.	Waxaa igu filan aniga.
She would.	Way lahayd.
What happened to you was horrible.	Waxa kugu dhacay ayaa ahaa mid aad u xun.
There really isn’t much here.	Runtii halkan wax badan kama jiraan.
But he is still unlucky.	Laakiin weli nasiib ma leh.
They may not know each other.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay is garanayn.
If you want me.	Haddii aad i rabto.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
It had to be done a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo wakhti dheer ka hor.
I will be.	Aniga ayaa ahaan doona.
He was robbed.	Waa lagu dhacay.
But there is.	Laakiin waxaa jira.
Sure, this is enough.	Hubaal, tani waa ku filan tahay.
He thought he would leave.	Wuxuu mooday inuu ka bixi doono.
You will still see him.	Weli waad arki doontaa isaga.
Otherwise, it is equally good.	Haddii kale, si la mid ah waa u fiican tahay.
Not sure what it is.	Ma hubo waxay tahay.
In fact, that is enough.	Runtii, taasi waa ku filan tahay.
what did you say	maxaad tidhi
That is good.	Taasi way fiican tahay.
It should not surprise him.	La yaab kuma noqon karto isaga.
I have seen enough.	Wax igu filan baan arkay.
I think this sounds a little off !.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay u egtahay mid yar!.
That really does matter.	Taasi run ahaantii waxba maaha.
I will definitely help.	Hubaal waan ku caawin doonaa.
I wonder if this is good.	Waxaan la yaabanahay in tani ay wanaagsan tahay.
What is it?.	Waa maxay?.
There is nothing to be desired here.	Ma jiraan wax la doonayo halkan.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
She was very smart.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u caqli badan.
It's very good.	Waa wax aad u wanaagsan.
She did not have time.	Muddo ma aysan haysan.
I'm sure that was correct.	Waan hubaa inay taasi sax ahayd.
He found me now.	Wuu i helay hadda.
Only.	Kaliya.
I thought you should know.	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad ogaato.
I do not really have much more to say.	Wax badan oo kale oo aan sheego ma hayo runtii.
Not much more than that.	Ma aha wax aad uga badan taas.
Once is enough.	Mar baa ku filan.
I don't do much.	Wax badan ma sameeyo.
He is with me.	Wuu ila joogaa.
It's a big problem right now.	Waa dhibaato weyn hadda.
He was a happy man.	Nin faraxsan buu ahaa.
I will be there to help you if you need me.	Waxaan u joogi doonaa inaan ku caawiyo haddii aad ii baahan tahay.
What would happen?	Maxaa dhici lahaa?
You have a lot.	Wax badan baad leedahay.
It would certainly happen.	Hubaal way dhici lahayd.
I do not want to stay here.	Ma doonayo inaan halkaan sii joogo.
And if you do.	Oo haddii aad sameyso.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
Not here.	Ma aha halkan.
Early work is best.	Shaqada hore ayaa ugu fiican.
Great guy really.	Nin weyn runtii.
No one is loved, no one is loved.	Ma jiro qof la jecel yahay, ma jiro qof la jecel yahay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I wanted something better	Waxaan rabay wax ka fiican
He was not a great man.	Ma ahayn nin weyn.
I know him very well.	Aad baan u garanayaa isaga.
Still something, something.	Weli wax, wax.
But he will speak soon.	Laakiin dhawaan wuu hadli doonaa.
Stop! 	Jooji!
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
I was the one who came to the people.	Anigu waxaan ahaa kii dadka u soo galay.
I think a lot.	Aniga waxay ila tahay wax aad u badan.
And if none are available.	Iyo haddii aysan jirin mid la heli karo.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
I can't find it	Ma awoodo inaan helo
Both are correct.	Labaduba waa sax.
He loves it.	Wuu jecel yahay.
But a little may help.	Laakiin wax yar ayaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawiso.
Now, there is no work going on.	Hadda, wax shaqo ah oo ka socda ma jirto.
All very clear.	Dhammaan aad u cad.
But you know it was.	Laakiin waad ogtahay inay ahayd.
I will go soon.	Waxaan aadi doonaa mar dhow.
I can see it again	Mar kale ayaan arki karaa
it was amazing.	yaab bay ahayd.
And among other things, he wanted to tell me.	Iyo waxyaabo kale, waxa uu rabay inuu ii sheego.
I can't stay.	Ma joogi karo.
I had a hard time talking to him.	Dhib ayaan u helay fursad aan kula hadlo.
I don't know if we can do more.	Ma garanayo in aan wax badan qaban karno iyo in kale.
I don't think you can just go.	Uma maleynayo in aad tagi karto oo kaliya.
Everything that existed.	Wax kasta oo jiray.
I think you will love him very much.	Waxaan filayaa in aad isaga aad u jeclaan doonto.
To do everything you can on your own.	Inaad samayso wax kasta oo aad keligaa samayn karto.
I really need you	Runtii waan kuu baahanahay
I saw.	waan arkay.
He knew what would happen.	Wuu ogaa waxa dhici lahaa.
Many of us are not.	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaan ahayn.
I had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah maan lahayn.
And no one.	Oo qofna.
I really need it.	Runtii waan u baahanahay.
She is lucky.	Way nasiib badan tahay.
So long.	Waqti sidaas u dheer.
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
Now I got it	Hadda waan helay
She clearly did.	Waxay si cad u samaysay.
Someone will pay for this.	Qof ayaa bixin doona tan.
This is a huge problem.	Tani waa dhibaato aad u weyn.
Maybe that's right	Malaha waa sax
It didn't turn out well.	Si fiican uma ay noqon.
Everything in it is true and false.	Wax kasta oo ku jira waa run iyo been.
This is why.	Tani waa sababta.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
Now there.	Hadda waxaa jira.
Really, it was awful.	Runtii, waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
But if we do, it may say more to those we don't like.	Laakiin haddii aan samayno, waxa laga yaabaa inay wax badan u sheegto cidda aan jeclayn.
It was good.	Wax fiican bay ahayd.
I wanted to talk to him, and talk to him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo, oo aan la hadlo.
you did not come.	ma aadan iman.
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor.
That is not a good thing.	Taasi wax wanaagsan maaha.
I never feel that way.	Weligay taas ma dareemayo.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
I seemed surprised.	Waxaan u muuqday inaan la yaabay.
I think you might find it interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad xiiso u heli karto.
Not like you.	Adiga oo kale maaha.
They could not do anything else.	Wax kale ma ay samayn karin.
Everything is new and very complex.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin oo aad bay u adag yihiin.
That will happen.	Taasi way dhici doontaa.
It just can't be me.	Aniga kaliya ma noqon karto.
Lots of money and lots of money.	Lacag badan iyo lacag badan.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
He is not a tall man.	Nin dheer maaha.
He is one of us.	Waa mid naga mid ah.
It will be good, you will see.	Way fiicnaan doontaa, waad arki doontaa.
I still didn't think so.	Weli taas uma malaynayn.
More than a man needs, for sure.	In ka badan nin u baahan yahay, hubaal.
I'm afraid it will never come out.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inuusan waligiis ka soo bixin.
I am not now	Hadda ma ihi
They are always there.	Had iyo jeer waa jiraan.
That's right, once.	Waa sax, hal mar.
Anyone can be.	Qof kastaa wuu noqon karaa.
You can't be.	Ma noqon kartid .
Is it done there.	Ma halkaas ayaa la sameeyay.
He wanted to stay.	Wuxuu rabay inuu joogo.
You are very smart.	Aad baad u caqli badan tahay.
He looked back.	Dib ayuu u eegay.
I was amazed at how popular it was.	Waxaan la yaabay sida loo jecel yahay.
I will definitely be here again.	Waa hubaal inaan halkan mar kale joogi doono.
I can't stay	Ma joogi karo
That.	Taasi.
I will see you	waan ku arki doonaa
Let's do this.	Aan samayno tan.
Otherwise I have one other idea.	Haddii kale hal fikrad kale ayaan hayaa.
he was not ready.	diyaar uma ahayn.
Good for everyone.	U fiican qof walba.
One day, for sure.	Hal maalin, hubaal.
Something for everyone.	Wax qof walba ah.
I, in fact, am not here and there.	Anigu, dhab ahaantii, ma joogo halkan iyo halkaas.
Do not do this.	Ha samayn tan.
He is a real person.	Waa qof dhab ah.
I don’t think food.	Uma maleynayo cunto.
This was amazing.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la yaab leh.
I started working	Waxaan bilaabay inaan shaqeeyo
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
The main room is large.	Qolka ugu weyn waa weyn yahay.
You need to help me.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad i caawiso.
She was a person.	Waxay ahayd qof.
In the same way.	Sidaas oo kale.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
But that is certainly not the case.	Laakiin hubaal taasi maaha.
It will not be.	Ma ahaan doono.
Anything small.	Wax kasta oo yar.
I will be first.	Waxaan ahaan doonaa marka hore.
Everyone said.	Qof kastaa wuu yidhi.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
A little came out.	Wax yar baa ka soo baxay.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Waan hubaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
I may not spend much time there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan waqti badan ku qaadan meesha.
He had to work on that.	Waxay ahayd inuu taas ka shaqeeyo.
Sure, he can still do it.	Hubaal, weli wuu samayn karaa.
They are other people.	Waa dadka kale.
They like to do it.	Waxay jecel yihiin inay sameeyaan.
I think it is right here.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay sax tahay halkan.
I love everything	wax walba waan jeclahay
This will take time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
He would love that, he said.	Wuu jeclaan lahaa taas, ayuu yidhi.
I didn't have much.	Wax badan ma haysan.
I refused	waan diiday
Not just today.	Kaliya maaha maanta.
They are many now.	Way badan yihiin hadda.
Tell me that again.	Mar kale taas ii sheeg.
Still, there is a lot to do.	Weli, waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo.
A little surprising.	Wax yar oo la yaab leh.
I can't stay	Ma joogi karo
Not right.	Sax maaha.
More is yet to come.	Wax badan ayaa weli soo socda.
I wanted to know everything.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ogaado.
Not sure where to leave here.	Ma hubo meesha laga tago halkan.
Everyone knows you are.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay inaad tahay.
This was not the case.	Tani ma ahayn sidaas oo kale.
How will you come?	Sidee ku iman doontaa?
I would really like to see it.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko.
He went back to the door.	Albaabka ayuu dib ugu noqday.
She was a very good man.	Waxay ahayd nin aad u wanaagsan.
You can see a lot.	Wax badan ayaad arki kartaa.
I will believe it	waan rumaysan doonaa
See you at school tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ku arki doonaa dugsiga.
I would be back	waan soo noqon lahaa
He seems to be where he is now.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa in uu yahay meesha uu hadda joogo.
A lot of things happened.	Waxyaabo badan oo dhacay.
I told him that.	Taas ayaan u sheegay.
Unbelievable work	Shaqo aan la rumaysan karin
I think it's really interesting.	Waxaan filayaa inay runtii aad u xiiso badan tahay.
That's right, he said.	Taasi waa sax, oo leh.
I have one now.	Mid baan leeyahay hadda.
That is not who he is.	Taasi maaha qofka uu yahay.
I told another.	Mid kale ayaan u sheegay.
I will be	waan ahaan doonaa
I need to know something else.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado wax kale.
Now he knows better.	Hadda si fiican ayuu u garanayaa.
I get nothing.	Waxba ma helo.
I have never seen this before.	Weligay tan hore uma arag.
Beautifully large.	Si qurux badan oo weyn.
I have never seen one before.	Weligay mid hore uma arag.
Exit.	La baxay.
He knew nothing of that.	Taas waxba kama uu ogayn.
That is not the case.	Taasi sidaas maaha.
They are not included.	Aniga kuma jiraan.
It was the best, so far.	Waxay ahayd tan ugu fiican, ilaa hadda.
Anyone can see it.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa.
She needs to know if he feels that way.	Waxay u baahan tahay inay ogaato haddii uu dareemayo sidaas oo kale.
Lots of fun.	Wax badan oo xiiso leh.
Trouble is for sure.	Dhib waa hubaal.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
I want it to be solid.	Waxaan rabaa inuu noqdo mid adag.
You can do the same.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax la mid ah.
I can do anything	Wax walba waan ku samayn karaa
I made one.	Mid baan sameeyay.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
One is coming.	Mid baa soo socda.
Too bad, for me anyway.	Aad u xun, aniga si kasta.
But no one would.	Laakiin qofna ma samayn lahaa.
Really, I'm really excited about him.	Runtii, runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga.
It is not in a good place.	Meel fiican ma joogo.
I would do the same.	Anigu sidaas oo kale ayaan samayn lahaa.
He was a happy person.	Wuxuu ahaa qof faraxsan.
I do not speak.	Ma hadlo.
There was something wrong with me.	Wax baa jiray aniga.
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
He did not want that.	Ma uusan rabin taas.
Everyone is right.	Qof walba waa sax.
He was not very successful.	Aad uma uu guulaysan.
And how much it is.	Iyo inta ay tahay.
Maybe that's all you need to know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
He was really here.	Runtii halkaan buu joogay.
If she is here, fine.	Haddii ay halkan joogto, fiican.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
She may be busy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay mashquul tahay.
Maybe a lot has been said.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax badan loo sheegay.
The reason for this is unknown.	Sababta arrintan lama garanayo.
It felt like time to do it.	Waxa la dareemay wakhti la samayn lahaa.
He did not understand what was going on.	Ma uu fahmin waxa socda.
But there is more to it than that.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan taas.
Although it is not accurate.	In kasta oo aanay ahayn mid sax ah.
No one knows who did it and why.	Qofna ma garanayo cidda samaysay iyo sababta.
He saw it today.	Maanta wuu arkay.
You can do anything.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta.
Less is really more.	In ka yar runtii waa badan tahay.
I will need more than anything.	Waxaan u baahan doonaa wax ka badan wax walba.
I must have been very young.	Waa inaan ahaa mid aad u yar.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
No other problems were seen	Wax dhibaato kale ah lama arag
There may be something.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax jiraan.
He did not find it here.	Halkan kama uu helin.
He decided to buy it.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu iibsado.
Me, me, me.	Aniga, aniga, aniga.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in badan.
It did not come from me.	Aniga igama iman.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
Less than before.	Ka yar sidii hore.
That is good for me.	Taasi waa igu fiican aniga.
You had great.	Waxaad lahayd weyn.
I did things	Waxaan sameeyay waxyaabo
He had a lot.	Wuxuu lahaa wax badan.
He did what was required.	Wuxuu sameeyay wixii la rabay.
Now he knows.	Hadda wuu garanayaa.
He did not tell anyone what he saw.	Qofna uma uu sheegin wuxuu arkay.
He said a little.	Wax yar buu yidhi.
I would love him.	Waan jeclaan lahaa isaga.
He paid nothing.	Waxba kama uu bixin.
There is nothing new to say.	Ma jiro wax cusub oo la odhan karo.
Either way it was.	Si kasta oo ay ahayd.
what is it you	waa maxay adiga?.
Surprisingly, very strange indeed.	Yaab, aad u yaab leh runtii.
He went out to see.	Wuxuu u baxay inuu soo arko.
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd mid cad.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
Please let me know if you have any ideas.	Fadlan ii soo sheeg haddii aad wax fikrad ah leedahay.
And very little.	Oo aad u yar.
Can it happen?	Ma dhici kartaa?
I know you want to.	Waan ogahay inaad rabto.
But they did not give time.	Laakiin ma ay siin waqti.
It is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
One day, no problem.	Maalin, dhib la'aan.
he was amazing.	yaab buu ahaa.
You know he will do it alone.	Waad ogtahay inuu keligiis samayn doono.
That will not happen here.	Taasi halkan kama dhici doonto.
They are the people.	Waa dadka.
Absolutely every day.	Dhab ahaantii maalin kasta.
He did not understand why.	Ma uu fahmin sababta.
I don't want to have that.	Ma doonayo inaan taas haysto.
.	.
I just want to be home again.	Waxa kaliya oo aan rabaa in aan mar kale guriga joogo.
I may tell you as well.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale kuu sheego.
I'll talk again.	Dib ayaan u hadli doonaa.
No problem.	Dhib ma leh.
We will do better.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa si ka wanaagsan.
Very close, very close.	Aad u dhow, aad u dhow.
Lack of opportunity.	Fursad la'aan.
Maybe you are really busy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad runtii mashquul tahay.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
They did nothing to me.	Waxba igama ay samayn.
You can say a lot.	Wax badan baad odhan kartaa.
I couldn't do it	Ma yeeli karin
John was hit by a car.	Yooxanaa waxaa ku dhacay baabuur.
But it was the best thing we could do.	Laakiin waxa ay ahayd waxa ugu fiican ee aan samayn karno.
It's a real job.	Waa shaqo dhab ah.
She was very happy today.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u faraxsan maanta.
Still, it is so.	Weli, waa sidaas.
We would not have had one chance at this!	Hal fursad ma heli lahayn tan!
None	Ma jiro
To my surprise, I really liked it.	Waxaa ila yaabay, runtii waan ka helay.
There was no way out.	Ma jirin meel laga baxo.
There is not much going on there.	Wax badan oo halkaas ka socda ma jiraan.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
That’s fine, it’s not fun, but it’s good.	Taasi waa fiican tahay, ma aha mid xiiso leh, laakiin waa fiican tahay.
Nothing is so difficult.	Ma jiro wax sidaas u adag.
That's a bit.	Taasi waa xoogaa.
She was, after all, very busy.	Waxay ahayd, ka dib oo dhan, aad mashquul.
And it was not a lie.	Oo been ma ahayn.
It has been so far.	Waxay ahayd ilaa hadda.
I say there is something else to learn.	Waxaan leeyahay wax kale oo la barto ayaa jira.
Certainly nothing will remain the same.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan wax sii ahaan doona sida ay tahay.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
It is still small.	Wali way yar tahay.
It was given to me.	Waa la i siiyay.
That's right.	Waa sax.
But often it is not.	Laakiin inta badan maaha.
So far, very well known.	Ilaa hadda, aad loo yaqaan.
Obviously you want something from me.	Waxaa cad in aad wax iga rabto.
I hope it helps.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
I do not know if this will be a problem.	Ma garanayo inay tani dhibaato noqon doonto.
But he was not the only one.	Laakiin ma ahayn ka kaliya.
Adequate funds were provided.	Lacag ku filan ayaa la siiyay.
No one wants it.	Nin ma rabto.
That will be a lot of work.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa shaqo badan.
It was a good place.	Waxay ahayd meel wanaagsan.
She could not find it.	Way heli weyday.
.	.
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
They are clear.	Way cad yihiin.
That is not what happened here.	Taasi maaha waxa halkan ka dhacay.
There is no problem with this.	Wax dhibaato ah kama jiraan arrintan.
That was how it was done.	Taasi waxay ahayd sida loo sameeyo.
I really am not.	Runtii sidaas ma ihi .
I can't find him here today.	Maanta waxba isaga halkan kama heli karo.
He entered.	Wuu galay.
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
That is for you to find out.	Taasi waa adiga si aad u ogaato.
You may not understand.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan fahmin.
Now you can get everything.	Hadda waxaad heli kartaa wax kasta.
I got that.	Waan helay taas.
As mentioned earlier.	Sida hore loo sheegay.
He appeared.	Wuxuu u muuqday.
But he was here.	Laakiin halkan wuu joogay.
I did not go to him.	Ma aan tagin isaga.
This is really interesting.	Tani runtii waa mid xiiso leh.
What can I do?	Maxaa samayn karaa.
He is beautiful.	Wuu qurux badan yahay.
But they will stay there.	Laakiin way joogi doonaan halkaas.
Maybe he can get it too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale heli karo.
I'm sorry, he said.	Waan ka xumahay, ayuu yidhi.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii cad.
But you can do this for me.	Laakiin tan waad ii samayn kartaa.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
He said it would not happen.	Waxa uu sheegay in aysan dhici doonin.
would be ready for that.	diyaar u noqon lahaa taas.
There was something he did not say.	Waxaa jiray wax uusan u sheegin.
It looks like a good place to be.	Waxay u egtahay meel wanaagsan oo la joogo.
Another happy person.	Qof kale oo faraxsan.
It may be very new.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u cusub tahay.
You know that.	Waad ogtahay inaad.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I'm not really sure.	Waxba ma hubo runtii.
I do not know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I'll stop there.	halkaas ayaan ku joojin doonaa.
That is the best thing we can do.	Taasi waa waxa ugu fiican ee aan sameyn karno.
I'm sorry for him.	Waan ka xumahay isaga.
It takes time.	Waqti ayuu u baahan yahay.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
Everyone else took it.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa qaatay.
I will find him.	waan heli doonaa isaga.
They love us.	Way na jecel yihiin.
No problem.	Dhib ma rabin.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
I can't believe he is doing this.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan samaynayo.
I took you here.	halkaan ayaan kugu qaaday.
This is a great day.	Tani waa maalin aad u weyn.
I know that a bit.	Waan ogahay in xoogaa.
She had to stay.	Waxay ahayd in la sii joogo.
No one is really sure.	Runtii qofna ma hubo.
I really don't know what to do.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
It is definitely bad.	Waxaa hubaal ah in ay xun tahay.
If anyone can, it is him.	Haddii qof uu awoodo, waa isaga.
I don't like him here.	Ma jecli isaga halkan.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
Something good happened.	Wax fiican baa ku dhacay.
The same is true for work.	Isla sidaas oo kale waa run shaqada.
I liked him.	Waan ka helay isaga.
That is all he needs.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee uu u baahan yahay.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
It was small but very beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid yar laakiin aad u qurux badan.
I asked her.	Waxaan ka codsaday inay.
He wanted it badly.	Si xun buu u rabay.
He will help me a lot.	Aad buu ii caawin doonaa.
The people here are very friendly.	Dadka halkan ku nool aad bay u saaxiib yihiin.
He came out.	Wuu ka soo baxay.
I liked it even better than before.	Waxaan ka helay xitaa si ka fiican kii hore.
I am a newcomer	waxaan ahay qof ku cusub
He decided he wanted me.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu i rabo.
She said she might have done it.	Waxay sheegtay in laga yaabo inay samaysay.
hold me.	igu qabo.
I do not have time for this.	Waqti uma hayo tan.
He did not say why.	Ma uusan sheegin sababta.
Can you help me help him?	Ma iga caawin kartaa inaan ka caawiyo isaga?
Otherwise, let me know.	Haddii kale, ii soo sheeg.
Previous work.	Shaqo hore.
You may have known this before and may not have known it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tan hore u ogaatay oo laga yaabo inaadan ogayn.
Not to say anything bad.	Si aan u sheegin wax xun.
He was surprised.	Wuu ka yaabay.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
It can be found here.	Waxaa laga heli karaa halkan.
I don't think so	caqli uma eka
It looks great.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid aad u fiican.
That includes me.	Taas waxaa ka mid ah aniga.
It will be a great surprise.	Waxay noqon la yaab weyn.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
You do not need	Uma baahnid
It will be the same.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid la mid ah.
That is what it is.	Waa waxa uu yahay.
Not sure what to look for.	Ma hubo waxa ugu fiican.
Strictly speaking, this is not true.	Marka si adag loo hadlo, tani sax maaha.
No one stopped me.	Qofna ima joojin.
I want to be true	Waxaan rabaa inaan run noqdo
This is a very bad time.	Tani waa waqti aad u xun.
It was not even a good day.	Xitaa maalin wanaagsan ma ahayn.
I think that's a lie.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi been tahay.
Not spoken.	Lama hadlin.
No one will stop you.	Qofna kuma joojin doono.
I don't like it very much.	Aad uma jecli.
You need to tell us something.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad wax noo sheegto.
I can talk	waan hadli karaa
No one can do better.	Qofna si ka wanaagsan uma samayn karo.
No one was ready to speak.	Qofna diyaar uma ahayn inuu hadlo.
There was not much time.	Ma jirin waqti badan.
Probably not.	Malaha ma soo bixi doonto.
Are you ready?	Diyaar ma u tahay?
Bigger than you.	Ka weyn adiga.
Everyone is there.	Mid kastaa wuu joogaa.
I was a little surprised.	Waan yara yaabay.
I'm in trouble here	dhib ayaan halkan joogaa
Everything and everyone.	Wax walba iyo qof walba.
Only one of us is still alive.	Kaliya mid naga mid ah ayaa weli nool.
No matter why you are here, just stay here.	Dhib malaha sababta aad u joogto, kaliya inaad halkan joogto.
He certainly does it for me.	Hubaal aniga ayuu igu sameeyaa.
It can be great again.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn mar kale.
He will be here shortly.	Wax yar ka dib ayuu halkan joogi doonaa.
She is even happier.	Xitaa way ku faraxsan tahay.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
Let me know.	Aan ogaado.
Take our place.	Meesha naga qabo.
He needs a bad one.	Mid xun buu u baahan yahay.
That will not do.	Taasi ma yeeli doonto.
Same here.	Isla sidaas oo kale halkan.
.	.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah igama qabo.
If you want to, you can do it.	Haddii aad rabto, waad sameyn doontaa.
I am not a close friend.	Ma ihi saaxiib dhow.
I assumed it was you.	Waxaan u qaatay inay adiga ahayd.
Found.	Soo helay.
I know you want me.	Waan ogahay inaad ila rabto.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
It was not a big deal.	Wax dhib badan ma ahayn.
But this was true.	Laakiin tani run bay ahayd.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
I really don't think so.	Runtii taas uma malaynayo.
I need a lot of bad stuff	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo xun
And as a surprise.	Iyo sida la yaab leh.
Can you help?	Ma caawin kartaa?.
I asked him how much money he wanted.	Waxa aan waydiiyay inta lacag ah ee uu rabo.
I had no idea she was so upset.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin inay aad uga xun tahay.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
It was a lie	Been bay ahayd
Now that does not exist.	Hadda taasi ma jirto.
Just give us another one.	Kaliya na sii mid kale.
What do you think of that?	Maxaad u malaynaysaa taas?
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Maybe I will.	Malaha waan yeeli doonaa.
He is ready to do it.	Wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu sameeyo.
It takes time.	Waxay u baahan tahay waqti.
But that really is not the case.	Laakiin taasi run ahaantii maaha.
Really, very interesting stuff.	Runtii, waxyaabo aad u xiiso badan.
He was a real man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin dhab ah.
No one wanted to be left out.	Qofna ma rabin in laga tago.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo, runtii.
That is what you do not understand.	Taasi waa waxa aadan fahmin.
This was a lie.	Tani waxay ahayd been.
Now he looks happy.	Hadda wuxuu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan.
I want to work with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
Now she realizes that is not the case.	Hadda way ogaatay in taasi aanay ahayn sidaas.
I need you now	hadda waan kuu baahanahay
It was unbelievable, really.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin, runtii.
This should not come as a surprise.	Tani ma noqon mid la yaab leh.
You can no longer be friends.	Mar dambe saaxiib ma noqon kartid.
I got something today.	Wax baan helay maanta.
I want you to know something.	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax ogaato.
I still haven't found it.	Wali ma helin.
Which was really nice.	Taas oo runtii ahayd mid fiican.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Way u qurux badan tahay sidii hore.
You did the right thing	Waxaad samaysay wax sax ah
This is going to be great.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
but that cannot be done.	laakiin taasi ma samayn karto.
I still want to	Wali waxaan rabaa
Both are very good.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin.
Maybe it was right.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay sax ahayd.
I don’t think they will happen.	Uma maleynayo inay dhici doonaan.
No one else.	Qof kale ma jiro.
But nothing was found.	Laakiin waxba lama helin.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
I knew he would not stay until recently.	Waan ogaa inuusan sii joogi doonin ilaa dhow.
If there is anything to be found.	Haddii ay jiraan wax la ogaado.
I thought you were alone.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad keligaa tahay.
If you can’t, that’s fine, too.	Haddii aadan awoodin, taasi waa fiican tahay, sidoo kale.
Before that there must be something.	Ka hor waa in wax jiraan.
I have to say nothing.	Waa inaan waxba odhan.
He may not get another chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan helin fursad kale.
I know you can do this.	Waan ogahay inaad tan samayn karto.
Now.	Hadda.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
I left	waan ka baxay
I thought the same thing.	Waxaan u maleeyay wax la mid ah.
That was something she could definitely do.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax hubaal ah inay samayn karto.
I am ready to talk about everything.	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan wax walba ka hadlo.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I know a lot about you.	Wax badan baan kaa ogahay.
I think there is one nearby.	Waxaan filayaa inuu jiro mid halkan u dhow.
But he refused to tell us.	Laakiin wuu diiday inuu noo sheego.
I did not know you were.	Maan garanayn inaad tahay.
There is no place like home	Meel guriga la mid ah ma jirto
You were not.	Ma aadan ahayn.
It is very difficult to talk about.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay in laga hadlo.
I did not understand this.	Ma aanan fahmin tan.
He could not tell me why.	Sababta ayuu ii sheegi waayay.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
That is a lot of money.	Taasi waa lacag aad u badan.
Like, just amazing stuff.	Sida, kaliya waxyaabo yaab leh.
There was none.	Ma jirin.
I still have it.	Wali waan hayaa.
You will see, you will see.	Waad arki doontaa, waad arki doontaa.
No one seemed to feel it.	Qofna uma eka inuu dareemay.
But he did not come.	Laakiin ma iman.
No man has ever looked like that.	Nin waligiis sidaas uma eka.
I will do that.	Waan samayn doonaa taas.
I don’t know how he did that.	Ma garanayo sida uu taas u sameeyay.
It's bad.	Way xun tahay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
You think you are very good.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad aad u fiican tahay.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I knew that would happen.	Waan ogaa in taasi dhici doonto.
You have a lot here.	Waxaad halkan wax badan.
What a place to study.	Maxaa meel wax lagu barto.
You will see it here.	Halkan ayaad ku arki doontaa.
available	laga heli karo
He left a little while ago.	Wax yar ka hor ayuu meesha ka baxay.
He asked once more.	Hal mar oo kale ayuu codsaday.
And maybe nothing.	Oo laga yaabaa in aanay waxba.
Not the best.	Ma ahan sida ugu fiican.
Something we have never seen before.	Wax aanu hore u arag.
It is difficult for him to say anything.	Way ku adag tahay inuu wax sheego.
No one did.	Qofna ma samayn.
Something happened to her.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
Indeed, this is true.	Runtii, tani waa run.
It was a very difficult job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo aad u adag.
I do not know what, but it is bad.	Ma garanayo waxa, laakiin way xun tahay.
Anyone can see it.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa.
More time.	Waqti badan.
He was at home with her.	Guriga ayuu la joogay.
I did not pay for this.	Ma aan bixin tan.
Several people said it was done with us.	Dhowr qof ayaa yiri waa nala sameeyay.
And tell me so.	Oo sidaas ii sheeg.
She said the right thing, always.	Waxay tidhi wax sax ah, had iyo jeer.
That would be.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd.
And here it is.	Oo waa kan.
How do they do it?	Sidee bay u sameeyaan?
I do not want to talk to you.	Ma rabo inaan kula hadlo.
I could not.	Waan awoodi waayay.
''	''
But I didn't need to.	Laakiin uma baahnayn.
Up to the door.	Ilaa albaabka.
And this is the best place.	Oo tani waa meesha ugu fiican.
You can do this one day.	Waad samayn kartaa taas hal maalin.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
Maybe he will tell me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ii sheego.
Maybe he is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu yahay.
Now comes a bit of a surprise.	Hadda waxaa yimid xoogaa yaab leh.
They have not yet found one.	Wali ma ay helin mid.
I would love to see him.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan arko isaga.
Not like you.	Adiga oo kale maaha.
He told us that.	Wuxuu noo sheegay taas.
As far as we can tell, everyone had a good time.	Inta aan sheegi karno, qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa waqti fiican.
It can be found here.	Waxaa laga heli karaa halkan.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
Otherwise, he would not.	Haddii kale, ma uu lahaa.
But that was not me.	Laakiin taasi aniga ma ahayn.
I would do whatever she wanted.	Waxaan samayn lahaa waxay doonto.
You need to do this.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad tan sameyso.
But this is often a lie.	Laakiin tani inta badan waa been.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
That was great for me.	Aniga taasi aad bay ii ahayd.
I have to go now, he said.	Waa inaan hadda tago, ayuu yidhi.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa ka dhacay.
I have to do it	Waa inaan sameeyaa
I wonder what you can find there.	Waa yaab waxa aad ka heli karto halkaas.
They remain in prison.	Way ku sii jiraan xabsiga.
Even more money.	Xitaa lacag badan.
He did not say that.	Taas ma uu sheegin.
He could not stop	Waa joojin waayay
it doesn't look good	si fiican uma eka
I think it's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay.
No one knew what had happened.	Qofna ma ogayn waxa dhacay.
Same as.	La mid ah sida.
I don’t know if that’s the reason for this.	Ma garanayo inay taasi tahay sababta tan.
I did not understand how to do this.	Anigu ma aan fahmin sida tan loo sameeyo.
There was nothing.	Waxba ma jirin.
But tell me.	Laakiin ii sheeg.
But it would take time.	Laakiin waxay qaadan lahayd wakhti.
She really had.	Runtii way lahayd.
I just came back from it.	Hadda ayaan ka soo noqday.
But still.	Laakiin weli.
But, this is just an idea.	Laakiin, tani waa fikrad kaliya.
Great food, very interesting.	Cunto aad u fiican, oo aad u xiiso badan.
There was an old one.	Waxaa jiray mid hore.
Live after all.	Nool ka dib dhan.
I liked what you have.	Waxaan ka helay waxaad leedahay.
You can go anywhere.	Meel kasta waad tagi kartaa.
Like work.	Sida shaqada oo kale.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Not interesting enough.	Ma aha mid xiiso leh oo ku filan.
I was everywhere.	Meesha oo dhan ayaan joogay.
Now that’s a big deal !.	Hadda taasi waa wax weyn!.
It was so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas.
What was true? 	Maxaa run ahaa?
Don't come here again.	Ha iman halkan mar dambe.
It's too bad yet.	Aad bay u xun tahay weli.
It is better than nothing.	Way ka fiican tahay waxba.
Someone else said he was.	Qof kale ayaa sheegay inuu ahaa.
He needs it.	Wuu u baahan yahay.
He did not understand that she loved him.	Ma uu fahmin inay jeceshahay isaga.
I do not understand why.	Ma fahmin sababta.
Everyone does.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
This was a bad thing.	Tani waxay ahayd wax xun.
But this was more than a few.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd in ka badan dhowr.
She is who she is.	Waa qofka ay tahay.
She loves him.	Way jeceshahay isaga.
I'm not sure what happened to me.	Ma hubo waxa igu dhacay.
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
It really did for me.	Dhab ahaantii way ii samaysay.
He said she was happy.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay ku faraxsan tahay.
He needs to talk.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu hadlo.
He didn’t do a very good job.	Ma uusan qaban shaqo aad u wanaagsan.
I was ready to go.	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan tago.
But it didn't matter why.	Laakiin dhib ma lahayn sababta.
It was a very good thing to do.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in la sameeyo.
I dont understand.	Maan fahmin.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
Here, there was only one.	Halkan, waxaa jiray hal kaliya.
Not true.	Aan run ahayn.
You would always wish there was another.	Had iyo jeer waxaad jeclaan lahayd inuu jiro mid kale.
It was true.	Waxay ahayd run.
I did the right thing	Wax sax ah ayaan sameeyay
Now she can talk.	Hadda way hadli kartaa.
Regularly for a period of time.	Si joogto ah muddo wakhti ah.
I can't be	Ma noqon karo
But he did nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma uu samayn.
I tried to tell him that.	Waxa aan isku dayay in uu sidaas ii sheego.
I have to.	Waa inaan .
She was lucky.	Nasiib bay lahayd.
He does not want to be.	Ma aha inuu doonayo inuu noqdo.
But that is not the main thing.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ugu weyn.
Everyone tried.	Qof kastaa wuu isku dayay.
Three of them.	Saddex ka mid ah.
You can still do this.	Weli waad samayn kartaa tan.
Out of prison so.	Ka baxay xabsiga sidaas.
Maybe that's true.	Malaha taasi waa run.
Good at what he does.	Ku fiican waxa uu sameeyo.
This was something new.	Tani waxay ahayd wax cusub.
I want to be new to myself	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo mid igu cusub
You could not give enough money to do it.	Ma aad siin karin lacag kugu filan oo aad ku sameyso.
Maybe it's nothing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay waxba.
He wants to talk.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu hadlo.
Just so beautiful.	Kaliya aad u qurux badan.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
But it is not there.	Laakiin meesha ma joogto.
Everyone does that.	Qof kastaa sidaas ayuu sameeyaa.
But now.	Laakiin hadda.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Someone, everyone.	Qof, qof kasta.
This is really something to do.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa wax ay tahay in la sameeyo.
Day after day before day.	Maalin ka dib maalin ka hor.
You can go back to work tomorrow.	Waxaad ku noqon kartaa shaqada berri.
Too busy to leave.	Mashquul aad u badan si uu u baxo.
That said, I didn't think it was a good job.	Taasi waxay tidhi, uma malaynayn inay tahay shaqo fiican.
I didn’t know you would be here.	Maan ogayn inaad halkan joogi doonto.
It has everything in there.	Waxay leedahay wax kasta oo ku jira halkaas.
There is not enough time.	Ma jiro waqti ku filan.
I have no hard work.	Shaqo adag ma qabo.
I'm glad you told me.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad ii sheegtay.
They will go for it.	Way u tagi doonaan.
It will not do.	Ma qaban doonto.
I just want to stay home.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan guriga joogo.
I am not the person they need.	Anigu ma ihi qofka ay u baahan yihiin.
Little did he know.	In yar baa ka ogaa.
You are right.	Run baad u sheegtay.
I still do not understand why.	Wali ma fahmin sababta.
He tried.	Wuu isku dayay.
It has to be good.	Waa inay wanaagsan tahay.
But, you know, what.	Laakiin, waad ogtahay, waa maxay.
Maybe it would be better to do it once.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay fiicnaan lahayd in hal mar la sameeyo.
Let me say more about the former.	Aan wax badan ka sheego kii hore.
That will come.	Taasi way iman doontaa.
They will see him.	Way arki doonaan isaga.
Both are very good.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin.
None.	Ma jirto.
I don't like this.	Ma jecli tan.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale ma jirto.
They did not say.	Ma ay odhan.
Here is why.	Waa kan sababta.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ku siin doonaa.
Don't get this.	Ha helin tan.
I don’t think you do.	Uma malaynayo inaad samaynayso.
You will not see me here.	Halkan ima arki doonto.
But not everyone can do that.	Laakiin qof walba taas ma samayn karo.
They will win.	Way guulaysan doonaan.
I do not understand this.	Maan fahmin tan.
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
It would be a good idea.	Waxay ahaan lahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I am very sorry.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay.
She was a happy person and a really good person.	Waxay ahayd qof faraxsan oo runtii qof wanaagsan.
To do what.	In la sameeyo waxa.
That is what she would do.	Taasi waa waxa ay samayn lahayd.
He bought it.	Wuu iibsaday.
But you didn't have him, you know.	Laakiin ma aadan lahayn isaga, waad ogtahay.
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
I am in it	waan ku jiraa
Please do not speak again.	Fadlan ha hadlin mar dambe.
I know there is more.	Waan ogahay inay jiraan wax ka badan.
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
This is probably the best.	Tani waxaa laga yaabaa inay ugu fiican tahay.
They are the same as everyone else.	Waxay la mid yihiin dadka kale.
Now he was surprised to see it again.	Hadda waxa uu la yaabay in uu mar kale arki doono.
They will help you.	Way ku caawin doonaan.
I haven't seen it in a long time!	Waqti dheer ma arag!
What's going on here? 	Maxaa halkan ka socda?
And here it is.	Oo waa kan hadda.
I think that is still true, for me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi wali run tahay, aniga.
Good so far.	Fiican ilaa hadda.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
He was the same.	Wuxuu ahaa isku mid.
You did everything.	Wax walba waad samaysay.
Not a new idea, really.	Maaha fikrad cusub, dhab ahaantii.
Very little came out.	Wax aad u yar ayaa soo baxay.
This is not very interesting.	Tani ma aha mid aad u xiiso badan.
Him, one.	Isaga, hal.
He was interesting.	Waxa uu ahaa mid xiiso leh.
You did well today.	Maanta si fiican ayaad samaysay.
That can be both good and bad.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan iyo mid xun.
You can get it.	Waxaad ku heli kartaa.
He looked very good.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u wanaagsan.
There is someone who must have seen something.	Waxaa jira qof ay tahay inuu wax arkay.
That's how it was.	Taasi waa sidii ay ahayd.
I am ready	diyaar ayaan ahay
It was money.	Waxay ahayd lacag.
I seem real.	Waxaan u muuqdaa mid dhab ah.
I really don't want to do that.	Runtii ma doonayo inaan sameeyo sidaas oo kale.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
I really didn't.	Runtii maan lahayn.
I saw everything.	Wax walba waan arkay.
It was always a bit, well.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd xoogaa, si fiican.
This is not a big deal.	Tani wax weyn maaha.
I had to learn a lot.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan barto.
That is great for me.	Taasi waa wax weyn aniga.
He was not really a man.	Runtii nin ma ahayn.
Maybe I am.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ahay.
But he would never do it, he knew that now.	Laakiin waligiis ma yeeli doono, wuu ogaa taas hadda.
This is how it is done.	Sidaas ayaa loo sameeyaa.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
It's a place to go.	Waxay u tahay meel uu ka baxo.
I have never found anything like it.	Waligiis ma helin wax la mid ah.
It was even more amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax ka sii yaab badan.
She did not get it.	Ma ay helin.
There is nothing else, nothing less.	Wax kale ma jiraan, wax ka yar ma jiraan.
But, you know, it's true.	Laakiin, waad ogtahay, waa run.
You can get whatever you want.	Waxaad heli kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
This can be done.	Tan waa la samayn karaa.
So far there is a lot of surprises.	Ilaa hadda waxaa jira wax badan oo la yaab leh.
I was everywhere and everything.	Waxaan ahaa meel kasta iyo wax kasta.
One came to him.	Mid baa u yimid.
Take time to do it.	Waqti qaado si aad u sameyso.
I don't care.	Aniga waxba igama hayo.
I just want to know this.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado tan.
He lives here.	Halkan ayuu ku nool yahay.
You may also be doing this correctly.	Ma laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale tan si sax ah u sameyso.
If you could get it.	Haddii aad heli lahayd.
I hope you do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso.
You know.	Waad ogaatay.
He had no job.	Shaqo ma lahayn.
I can see it now	Hadda waan arki karaa
I quickly decided something else.	Wax kale ayaan degdeg u go'aansaday.
I would say that.	taas ayaan odhan lahaa.
I am unemployed	Waxaan ahay shaqo la'aan
It was only when.	Waxay ahayd oo kaliya markii ay.
But no problem.	Laakiin dhib ma lahayn.
I want one, too.	Mid baan rabaa, sidoo kale.
I want to get to know him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan barto isaga.
Now there is nowhere to go.	Hadda meel la aado ma jirto.
It could be tomorrow	Waxay noqon kartaa berri
The first is this.	Ka hore waa kan.
It was known.	Waa la ogaa.
A long time ago, several times.	Waqti dheer ka hor, dhowr jeer.
I used to do that.	sidaas ayaan u samayn jiray.
They are good, but they are very big.	Way fiican yihiin, laakiin aad bay u weyn yihiin.
It was still.	Weli way ahayd.
And he shouldn't have left.	Oo ma ahayn inuu baxo.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
And really.	Oo dhab ah.
Maybe a little.	Malaha wax yar.
That will do.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa.
What did I get now?	Hadda maxaa helay?.
Why so much? 	Waa maxay sababta aad u badan?
You did not.	Ma aadan samayn.
No one knows where he is.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu joogo.
I want him now here.	Waxaan rabaa isaga hadda halkan.
What a wonderful day.	Waa maxay maalin fiican.
And maybe that's right.	Oo malaha waa sax.
Not here, not now.	Halkan maaha, hadda maaha.
I think.	Waxaan qabaa.
There were no problems with the work.	Ma jirin wax dhibaato ah oo shaqada ah.
We were just friends.	Waxaan ahayn kaliya saaxiibo.
Others.	Dadka kale.
he could not find.	wuu heli waayay.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
There is no such thing, again.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro, mar kale.
Even a good friend.	Xitaa saaxiib fiican.
But he saw nothing.	Laakiin waxba kama uu arag arrintan.
Not really right.	Run ahaantii sax maaha.
I had little.	Waxaan lahaa wax yar.
And he will do so.	Oo sidaas wuu yeeli doonaa.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
Even if it is bad, even if it is really bad.	Xitaa haddii ay xun tahay, xitaa haddii ay run ahaantii xun tahay.
But something told her not to do that.	Laakiin wax baa u sheegay in aanay taas samayn.
But whatever, man.	Laakiin wax kasta, nin.
He clearly does not want to help me.	Si cad ma rabo inuu i caawiyo.
I have to go again.	Waa inaan mar kale tago.
This will be.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa.
This can be great.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn.
Probably too much.	Malaha aad u badan.
This is not the same.	Tani isku mid maaha.
She is still fine.	Wali way wanaagsan tahay.
It still didn't help.	Wali ma caawin.
I have never seen that.	Weligay taas ma arag.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
It's you, isn't it?	Waa adiga, saw maaha?
Everyone will believe in him.	Qof kastaa wuu rumaysan doonaa isaga.
This is not me.	Tani aniga ma aha.
I got it again.	Mar kale ayaan helay.
Now, she was like him.	Hadda, waxay la mid ahayd isaga.
More than that, he knew it was true.	In ka badan, wuxuu ogaa inay run tahay.
As if there was no time she didn't like.	Sida in aanay jirin wakhti aanay jeclayn.
I can help him with that.	Taas waan ka caawin karaa isaga.
Do you know what.	Ma ogtahay waxa.
The place.	Meesha.
That is the only problem.	Taasi waa dhib kaliya.
Do not pay.	Waxba ha bixin.
Tell me.	Ii sheeg.
Only once more.	Kaliya hal mar oo kale.
He was just amazing.	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya yaab.
She will go, but she will not stay.	Way tagi doontaa, laakiin ma joogi doono.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
So much food was available.	Cunto aad u badan ayaa la helay.
I did not understand at first.	Maan fahmin markii hore.
Beautiful place.	Meel qurux badan.
I wanted him to go.	Waxaan rabay inuu tago.
But it can be.	Laakiin way noqon kartaa.
That was for sure.	Taasi hubaal waxay ahayd mid iska cad.
There is nothing against him.	Wax isaga ka dhan ah ma jiro.
This has been seen.	Tani waa la arkay.
It's a big job.	Waa shaqo weyn.
This will be the same.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid la mid ah.
It was a lot of work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo badan.
For a very long time.	Muddo aad u dheer.
Several times.	Dhowr jeer.
He will tell you what he saw.	Wuxuu kuu sheegi doonaa wuxuu arkay.
I hold you	waan ku hayaa
I don't have time to work right now.	Waqti aan ku shaqeeyo ma hayo hadda.
For a while, no one spoke.	In muddo ah, qofna ma hadlin.
You should have known that.	Waxay ahayd inaad taas ogaato.
I would like him to leave.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu baxo.
The more I looked, the faster I looked.	Inta aan eegay ayaan si degdeg ah u eegay.
I wanted to say.	Waxaan rabay in aan sheego.
Three three.	Saddex saddex.
I think a lot.	Waxaan qabaa in badan.
That was someone else.	Taasi waxay ahayd qof kale.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
She was like him.	Isaga la mid bay ahayd.
She is happy for him.	Way ku faraxsan tahay isaga.
You can stay there tonight.	Waad joogi kartaa halkaas caawa.
It was bad.	Xun buu lahaa .
I only want one.	Waxaan rabaa mid kaliya.
A small fee was charged.	Lacag yar ayaa laga qaaday.
There was none.	Ma jirin.
They are more than now.	Way ka badan yihiin hadda.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
This is true, very true.	Tani waa run, aad run u ah.
I will do it	waan samayn doonaa
you are a great man.	nin weyn baad tahay.
They are good things, but they are only good things.	Waa waxyaabo fiican, laakiin waa waxyaabo kaliya.
This is really a bad idea.	Runtii tani waa fikrad aad u xun.
Each of us felt it.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah ayaa dareemay.
She would like to help you.	Waxay jeclaan lahayd inay ku caawiso.
I knew that very well.	Taas si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
I still have a lot of friends there.	Weli waxaan halkaas ku leeyahay saaxiibo badan.
A long time ago.	Waqti dheer ka hor.
I really don't know why.	Runtii ma garanayo sababta.
It was great to see.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u fiican in la arko.
Now he is back.	Hadda wuu soo noqday.
I asked why.	Sababta ayaan waydiiyay.
What would you do there.	Maxaad ka samayn lahayd halkaas.
Beautiful place but abandoned.	Meel qurux badan laakiin laga tagay.
She could not.	Way awoodi wayday.
Each one left without saying a word.	Mid walba waxa uu ka tagay isaga oo aan odhan.
Several times, maybe.	Dhowr jeer, malaha.
He said and did nothing.	Wuu yidhi oo waxba ma samayn.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
Maybe something was done as before.	Ma laga yaabaa in sidii hore wax loo samayn jiray.
You can do anything, there.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta, halkaas.
This is really the case.	Runtii tani waa sidaas.
What did he come up with?	Muxuu la yimid?
No one knew where he went.	Qofna ma garanayn meel uu aaday.
It was not me.	Aniga ma ahayn.
I got nothing more.	Wax ka badan ma helin.
I can't come home.	Guriga ma iman karo.
He really liked it.	Aad buu uga helay.
I'm happy.	waan ku faraxsanahay.
But everyone else knows.	Laakiin qof kasta oo kale wuu garanayaa.
What an amazing thing to do!	Maxaa la yaab leh in la sameeyo!
There is so much now.	Hadda wax badan baa jira.
He loves to learn.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu wax barto.
He will do well.	Si fiican ayuu u samayn doonaa.
I'll tell you later.	dib ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa.
You can't imagine.	Ma malayn kartid.
Not much.	Ma badna.
The French did.	Faransiiska ayaa sameeyay.
In fact,	Dhab ahaantii,
Everything is clear.	Wax walba waa si cad.
It may take time to do so.	Waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti in sidaas la sameeyo.
It would be a long, long day.	Waxay noqon lahayd maalin dheer oo dheer.
I do not know what it was.	Ma garanayo waxay ahayd.
I just want to be told.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in la ii sheego.
It was small.	Waxay ahayd mid yar.
It’s so much more.	Waa wax aad u badan.
It could be that.	Waxay noqon kartaa taas.
They will do everything for you.	Wax walba way kuu qaban doonaan.
Just a chance.	Kaliya fursad.
He wanted to know where it might be.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado meesha ay noqon karto.
You do not have to be helped.	Ma aha in lagu caawiyo.
We are wanted.	Waa nala rabaa.
It looks like a beautiful place.	Waxay u egtahay meel qurux badan.
She already has.	Waxay hore u leedahay.
But I did not get it.	Laakiin ma helin.
Will money.	Doono lacag.
I hope I can help you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku caawin karo
We can't stay together.	Ma wada joogi karno.
Do not take it for granted.	Ha u qaadan wax run ah.
I don't think there is anything we can do about it.	Uma maleynayo inay jiraan wax aan ka qaban karno.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
Maybe no one does.	Malaha qofna ma sameeyo.
I had that.	Waxaan lahaa taas.
Maybe he just started.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hadda bilaabay.
What is this.	Waa maxay waxaan.
It wasn’t just beautiful.	Ma ahayn qurux kaliya.
It is not beautiful and will require some work.	Ma qurux badna oo waxay u baahan doontaa xoogaa shaqo ah.
That was a good idea.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I know he will.	Waan ogahay inuu yeeli doono.
He never got it.	Waligiis ma helin.
That is how it should be done.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay in la sameeyo.
They love you.	Way ku jecel yihiin.
I have to know what, in fact, happened.	Waa inaan ogaado waxa, dhab ahaan, dhacay.
I don't know why this is.	Ma garanayo sababta tani u tahay.
That shouldn’t be a surprise.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon wax la yaab leh.
You did it a few years ago.	Waxaad samaysay dhowr sano ka hor.
I wonder what will happen.	Waxaan filayaa maxaa dhici doona.
So beautiful and beautiful.	Si qurux badan oo qurux badan.
Three years of it.	Saddex sano ka mid ah.
He did not speak.	Ma uusan hadlin.
Give him what he wants.	Sii wuxuu doono.
She had to do it, she had to.	Waxay ahayd inay samayso, waa inay.
Don't be.	Ha noqon.
Another bad idea.	Fikrad kale oo xun.
As if he would do that.	Sida haddii uu taas samayn lahaa.
I really.	Anigu runtii.
Is that correct?	Ma sax baa?.
But he did not say much.	Laakiin wax badan ma odhan jirin.
Good one.	Mid wanaagsan.
It was almost time.	Waxay ahayd waqti ku dhow.
He may not know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ogeyn.
I will do nothing else.	Wax kale ma sameyn doono.
That doesn't matter.	Taasi waxba maaha.
I wanted to know more.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ogaado.
But it needs to be said.	Laakiin waxaa loo baahan yahay in la sheego.
I hope you know that.	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas ogtahay.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
I have it now.	hadda waan hayaa.
It really doesn't matter.	Runtii waxba maaha.
I do not think this will happen again.	Uma maleynayo in tani ay dib u dhici doonto.
Which is something he would do.	Taas oo ah wax uu samayn lahaa.
He said he could not say why he refused.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu sheegi karin sababta uu u diiday.
Maybe friends.	Malaha saaxiibo.
It was picked up.	Waa la soo qaaday.
Got that.	Helay taas.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Everything will do, really.	Wax kasta ayaa sameyn doona, runtii.
More than one.	In ka badan hal.
That really is true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
I'm sorry for him.	Waan ka xumahay isaga.
I can pay and receive	Waan bixin karaa oo heli karaa
I just think you are.	Kaliya waxaan kuu maleynayaa inaad tahay.
She said she didn't.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay lahayn.
I want to know what he knows.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wuxuu yaqaan.
You did it right.	Si sax ah ayaad u samaysay.
But it was the right thing to do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
But now I did not.	Laakiin hadda ma aanan samayn.
That may be the first time.	Taasi waxay ahaan kartaa markii hore.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan.
I don't want to know.	Ma rabo inaan ogaado.
They did not have him.	Ma ay haysan isaga.
Very good, very good.	Aad u fiican, aad u fiican.
I have never even seen it.	Weligay xitaa ma arag.
I do not understand that.	Ma fahmin taas.
He now lives there.	Hadda wuu ku nool yahay halkaas.
It is often the same.	Inta badan waa sidaas oo kale.
Here you are.	Halkan ka aad ku fiican tahay.
It's not pretty.	Ma qurux badna.
Who and what is not yet known.	Yaa waxa iyo sababta aan weli la garanayn.
But if not.	Laakiin haddii aysan ahayn.
It can be, it can not be.	Waxa ay noqon kartaa, ma noqon kartaa.
I really do not know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
Maybe it would be better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay fiicnaan lahayd.
You are so beautiful you don’t have what you want.	Aad baad u qurux badan tahay inaadan haysan waxaad rabto.
Not a little.	Wax yar maaha.
He is the best at what he does.	Isaga ayaa ugu fiican waxa uu sameeyo.
In fact, few of us are.	Dhab ahaantii, in yar oo naga mid ah ayaa ah.
And it’s not just obvious either.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya mid cad sidoo kale.
That 's a smart thing to do.	Taasi waa wax caqli badan oo la sameeyo.
I think she did.	Waxaan filayaa inay samaysay.
I can do that now	Taas hadda waan samayn karaa
He did not want to be found.	Ma uu rabin in la helo.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
Not like now.	Ma aha sida hadda.
I can do it	Waan samayn karaa
I do not know where to go from here.	Ma garanayo meel aan ka tago halkan.
I wish I did not know.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaanan garanayn.
There is not much.	Wax badan ma jiraan.
That's right.	Waa sax.
It can certainly be said better.	Waxaa hubaal ah in si ka wanaagsan loo odhan karo.
One of you.	Mid kaa mid ah.
He decided that was enough.	Waxa uu go'aansaday in taasi ku filan tahay.
You can't come out.	Ma soo bixi kartid.
I just want to see.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko.
I need to know more about it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan ka ogaado.
It would probably be very good.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahaan lahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I still haven't found it.	Wali maan helin.
She still does that.	Weli way samaysay taas.
I would do nothing for you	Waxba waan kuu qaban lahaa
You know you are happy.	Waad ogtahay inaad faraxsan tahay.
It is really beautiful to see.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay in la arko.
She has a job.	Waxay leedahay shaqo.
We will do everything.	Wax walba waanu ka yeeli doonaa.
he didn't, you know.	ma uu samayn, waad ogtahay.
I would see you	waan ku arki lahaa
Most did not.	Inta badan ma samayn.
Not that it is a bad thing.	Ma aha in ay tahay wax xun.
That’s my favorite thing about him.	Taasi waa waxa aan ugu jeclahay isaga.
Definitely for me.	Waa hubaal aniga.
But it was too much.	Laakiin aad bay taas u ahayd.
As they do.	Sida ay sameeyaan.
What you are saying is not very interesting.	Waxa aad leedahay maaha mid aad u xiiso badan.
It doesn't matter who she is.	Wax dhib ah ma leh cidda ay tahay.
He started.	Ayuu ku bilaabay.
You may be smart, but you can't do it alone.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad caqli badan tahay, laakiin keligaa ma samayn kartid.
You can do it again.	Waad sameyn kartaa mar kale.
They did not like to be so friendly.	Ma ay jeclayn in ay sidaas saaxiib la yihiin.
It is very clear.	Aad buu u cad yahay.
There are a few things you should know.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo yar oo ay tahay inaad ogaato.
You are good at it.	Waad ku fiican tahay.
That is good now.	Taasi way fiican tahay hadda.
Maybe I am here as everywhere.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan halkaan joogo sida meel kasta.
I still haven’t really done it.	Wali ma samayn runtii.
But he heard it again.	Laakiin mar kale ayuu ka maqlay.
Maybe that's not a bad thing, he thought.	Malaha taasi wax xun maaha, ayuu is yidhi.
I would really like that.	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa taas.
I would not agree.	Ma ogolaan lahaa.
Good job, friend.	Shaqo fiican, saaxiib.
Hard for me, but it is necessary.	Mid igu adag aniga, laakiin waa mid loo baahan yahay.
He said it was lucky.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay ahayd nasiib.
There is nothing else to do here.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo halkan lagu sameeyo.
I am ready to do it	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan sameeyo
I knew he was a real person	Waan ogaa inuu ahaa qof dhab ah
I fell a little short	Meel yar ayaan ka dhacay
He did not know if they were still alive.	Ma uu garanayn inay weli nool yihiin iyo in kale.
There was no way to tell.	Ma jirin si loo sheego.
You were just.	Waxaad ahayd kaliya.
It's just what it is.	Kaliya waa waxa ay tahay.
I hope he sees this wherever he is	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu tan ku arko meel kasta oo uu joogo
I have to.	Waa inaan.
I need to know what is going on here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxa halkan ka socda
There was so much more she could do.	Wax badan oo kale oo ay samayn lahayd ayaa jiray.
I know it is not.	Waan ogahay inuusan ahayn.
It is what we are.	Waa waxa aan nahay.
Are they the same.	Ma isku mid yihiin.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
I know everything that is going on here	Waan ogahay wax kasta oo halkan ka socda
This is a lot.	Tani waa wax badan.
How to do it.	Sida uu yeeli lahaa.
Also, it is difficult for you.	Sidoo kale, way kugu adag tahay.
I had	waan lahaa
A little more fun is too long, too	Wax yar oo xiiso leh ayaa aad u dheer, sidoo kale
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
I got something from him	Wax baan ka helay isaga
I need to see	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax arko
Get it all out.	Soo bixi dhammaan.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
But that was not true.	Laakiin taasi run ma ahayn.
I thought he was lucky	Waxaan u arkay inuu nasiib leeyahay
I found nothing surprising	Wax la yaab leh ma helin
I could not find anything to do with him	Maan helin si aan isaga wax ku helo
He can see, but he can't get it right.	Wuu arki karaa, laakiin si sax ah uma heli karo.
I want to talk to you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa hadlo
It is the best !.	Waa kan ugu fiican!.
I hope you know that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad taas ogtahay
That doesn't matter.	Taasi waxba maaha.
I do a lot	Aad baan u sameeyaa
This is a good thing for me.	Tani waa wax ii fiican.
This is the only time it is mentioned.	Tani waa marka kaliya ee la sheego.
Many of us were like that	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaa sidaas ahaa
It looks like a real thing.	Waxay u egtahay wax dhab ah.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado.
I said that a lot of it was time	Waxaan sheegay in in badan oo ka mid ah ay ahayd waqti
For a long time she did not like it.	Muddo dheer ma ay jeclayn.
I was shocked	Yaab ayaa iga dhacay
I really did not want to see it	Runtii ma rabin inaan arko
This was not correct.	Tani sax ma ahayn.
I'm so sorry, not really	Aad ayaan uga xumahay, ma aha runtii
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
Leaving everything.	In wax walba laga tago.
Maybe it would help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawin lahayd.
I know this will not happen again	Waan ogahay in tani aysan dhici doonin mar kale
I don't think it is.	Uma maleynayo inay tahay.
I did not want to know more about it	Ma rabin inaan wax badan ka ogaado
A smart man, a good man.	Nin caqli badan, nin wanaagsan.
I will stay here	halkaan ayaan joogi doonaa
Not yet spoken.	Weli lama hadlin.
I will certainly do it	Hubaal waan samayn doonaa
I should not have told anyone	Ma ahayn inaan cidna u sheego
I think that's right	Waxay ila tahay sax
I wonder if you would help me with something.	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aad wax igu caawin lahayd.
I was told that maybe you could help	Waxaa la ii sheegay in laga yaabo in aad caawin karto
Just me.	Aniga kaliya.
I could not separate	Waan kala tagi waayay
I do not know who started it	Ma garanayo kan bilaabay
What do you think we should do?	Maxay kula tahay inaan samayno?.
Give it time.	Waqti sii.
But still, it is.	Laakiin weli, waa.
But he does not want to stay.	Laakiin ma rabo inuu sii joogo.
I just know where you are	Kaliya waan garanayaa meesha aad joogto
He was in good spirits.	Niyad wanaagsan buu lahaa.
What exactly do you want.	Maxaa dhab ah oo aad rabto.
I know that will take time	Waan ogahay in taasi waqti qaadan doonto
It will be seen soon.	Mar dhow waa la arki lahaa.
I do not see that.	Taas ma arko.
Not sure now.	Ma hubo hadda.
It is really beautiful	Runtii waa qurux
Not so bad.	Ma aha sidaas u xun.
That is because it did not exist.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah ma jirin.
I wish it was not so	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aanay sidaas ahayn
I made it work for him	Waxaan ka dhigay inuu u shaqeeyo
I think he was a man	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu ahaa nin
I don't like it now	Ma jecli hadda
I felt like a new person	Waxaan dareemay sidii qof cusub
He said she was beautiful, and smart.	Wuxuu sheegay inay qurux badan tahay, oo caqli badan.
Not as he had.	Ma aha sidii uu lahaa.
Do a great job.	Qabo shaqo weyn.
But it is an idea.	Laakiin waa fikrad.
But she did not come.	Laakiin ma ay iman.
If there are, we need more of them.	Haddii ay jiraan, waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo ka mid ah.
He is still there.	Wali wuu joogaa.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax fiican.
I did.	Waan sameeyay.
I went there today, but no one was there	Maanta halkaas ayaan u aaday, laakiin qofna ma joogin
I know everything.	Wax walba waan ogahay.
new.	cusub.
Every day there was something.	Maalin kasta waxaa jiray wax.
I can see it even here	Waan arki karaa xitaa halkan
I even started to wonder if it was true or not	Waxaan xitaa bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay inaad run tahay iyo in kale
I decided to pick it up	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan soo qaado
I told him the truth	Run baan u sheegay
Every place is so beautiful indeed.	Meel kasta oo aad u qurux badan dhab ahaantii.
I also did not want to tell anyone.	Sidoo kale ma rabin inaan cidna u sheego.
I tried to talk about him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ka hadlo isaga.
You may not get it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan helin
I want to help you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
I was not	Maan ahayn
I really hope he can help me	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inuu i caawin karo
I can't see	Ma arki karo
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
Why not get it all ?.	Waa maxay sababta loo heli waayay dhammaan?.
I was very close.	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u dhow.
Nothing to see there.	Ma jiraan wax halkaas lagu arko.
I wouldn’t really take it.	Si dhab ah uma qaadan lahayn.
I could not	Waan awoodi waayay
I don't like to talk about it.	Ma jecli inaan ka hadlo.
But it is very common somewhere.	Laakiin aad bay ugu badan tahay meel.
I love money	Waxaan jeclahay lacag
He told me to do it again.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aan mar kale sameeyo.
It is a job offer	Waa shaqo bixin
I look forward to working with you as well	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan sidoo kale kula shaqeeyo
It certainly is.	Waxaa hubaal ah.
I wanted you to know what was going on	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato waxa socda
I did not understand anything	Waxba kama fahmin
It is beautiful here	Waa qurux halkan
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
I'm glad you did	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad samaysay
She should not have liked what she did not understand.	Ma ahayn in ay jeceshahay waxa aanay fahmin.
I have already done this at home.	Waxaan tan hore ugu sameeyay guriga.
That's what it looks like.	Taasi waa sida ay u egtahay.
I took a lot.	Wax badan ayaan qaatay.
I just don’t like to let anyone else know	Kaliya ma jecli in qof kasta oo kale ogaado
I really had nothing to do	Runtii maan haysan wax aan sameeyo
I just want to do what is best for you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kuu sameeyo waxa adiga kuu fiican
If you do not have it, you want it very bad.	Haddii aadan haysan, aad rabto in aad u xun.
I do not have to talk about it.	Ma ahan inaan ka hadlo.
That's right.	Waa sax.
I can hardly believe that you love me so much	Si dhib ah ayaan u rumaysan karaa inaad aad ii jeceshahay
In fact, it does not matter.	Dhab ahaantii, waxba maaha.
I did not say anything	Wax walba uma sheegin
Maybe I don't know today	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan maanta garanayn
I would love to see you	Waxaan aad u jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko
I found this to be true.	Waxaan u arkay in tani run tahay.
I can help you if you need anything	Waan ku caawin karaa haddii aad wax u baahan tahay
It should be nothing, really.	Waa in aanay waxba ahayn, runtii.
I want you to know him	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato isaga
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
Who will fall?	Yaa soo dhici doona?.
She's so cute, too.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay, sidoo kale.
I hope they are not home now	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan hadda guriga joogin
I would like to help you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku caawiyo
What else do you need?	Maxaa kale oo aad u baahan tahay?.
Maybe he saw something he didn't have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu arkay wax aysan ahayn inuu haysto.
She said it was a good idea.	Waxay sheegtay inay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I can't say anything.	waxba ma odhan karo.
But someone has to do it.	Laakiin qof waa inuu sameeyaa.
It is not beautiful.	Ma qurux badna.
I was a good man.	Waxaan ahaa nin wanaagsan.
I picked it up.	Waan soo qaaday.
Very difficult, for sure.	Aad u adag, hubaal.
tell me what you like to eat.	ii sheeg waxa aad jeceshahay in aad cunto.
I can see what he would see in you	Waan arki karaa waxa uu kugu arki lahaa
The smaller, the better.	Inta ka sii yar, ayaa ka sii fiican.
I will not do this again.	Mar dambe tan ma samayn doono.
This is not a good place to be.	Tani maaha meel fiican oo la joogo.
I can't say anything	waxba ma odhan karo
I looked around the room again	Qolka ayaan mar kale eegay
I just couldn’t give her what she wanted	Kaliya ma siin karin waxay rabto
He is more than any wise man.	Waa ka caqli kasta oo caqli leh.
I think it was another	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay ahayd mid kale
I should not have gone	Ma ahayn inaan tago
she was not ready.	diyaar uma ay ahayn.
I need to tell you something.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax kuu sheego.
I doubt it, but maybe	Waan ka shakisanahay, laakiin malaha
It would soon be over.	Mar dhow way dhammaan lahayd.
I still do not understand	Wali ma fahmin
I did not do that.	Taas maan samayn.
No one has a hard time.	Qofna waqti adag ma haysto.
And if you are not going to help him, you have to do it.	Oo haddii aadan isaga caawin doonin, taasi waa inaad sameyso.
Definitely enough, there was another.	Hubaal ku filan, waxaa jiray mid kale.
I really like it here	Runtii waan jeclahay halkan
I think he was in something	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu wax ku jiray
Maybe time needs something else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waqti u baahan yahay wax kale.
We can not do that.	Ma samayn karno sidaas.
I expect to talk to you tomorrow	Waxaan filayaa inaan kula hadli doono berri
For a long time, he said nothing.	Muddo dheer, waxba ma uu odhan.
There is a lot of fun here.	Halkan waxaa jira xiiso badan.
She is fine now.	Hadda way fiican tahay.
I want you to be here with me	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan ila joogto
He has just arrived.	Dhawaan wuu soo galay.
How many times I could not tell you	Inta jeer ayaan kuu sheegi waayay
I say what is true and clear and visible	Waxaan leeyahay waxa run ah oo cad oo la arki karo
I did not see anything coming out	Wax ka soo baxay ma arag
I can't believe he didn't come home with us.	Ma rumaysan karo in aanu guriga nala iman.
Here and now.	Halkan iyo hadda.
I could not say what it was	Ma sheegi karin waxay tahay
And you must do the same.	Oo waa inaad sidaas oo kale samayso.
I could not speak correctly	Si sax ah uma hadli karin
Nice to be here!	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto!
Just tell me that.	Kaliya taas ii sheeg.
He really liked what it looked like.	Dhab ahaantii wuu ka helay sida ay u egtahay.
I do what is required of me	Waxaan sameeyaa waxa la iga rabo
No one likes it.	Qofna ma jecla.
But he did not get it.	Laakiin ma uu helin.
What an interesting thing.	Waa maxay wax xiiso leh.
I asked her to stay with me	Waxaan ka codsaday inay ila joogto
Also, you are good at it.	Sidoo kale, waad ku fiican tahay.
It may have happened to me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu igu dhacay.
I know you are very busy	Waan ogahay inaad mashquul badan tahay
I am with you, I am with you now	Waan ku joogaa, hadda waan kula joogaa
He told them not to come.	Waxa uu u sheegay in aanay iman.
I just have to know what it is	Kaliya waa inaan ogaado waxa ay tahay
They love you there.	Waxay ku jecel yihiin halkaas.
I wish you did not leave	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaadan ka tagin
It can all be done.	Dhammaan waa la samayn karaa.
After a while, but I will cook it again.	Xoogaa ka dib, laakiin dib ayaan u karin doonaa.
I know it will be out soon	Waan ogahay inay dhawaan bixi doonto
I think they are a good thing	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay yihiin wax wanaagsan
She really told me something.	Runtii wax bay igu tidhi.
As you are.	Sida aad tahay.
That is how good they are.	Taasi waa sida ay u wanaagsan yihiin.
I am you	aniga ayaa adiga ah
I think that is the main reason	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay sababta ugu weyn
Unable to help.	Waa la caawin waayay.
It happened, and.	Wuu dhacay, oo.
I need to do that	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sidaas u sameeyo
I can do nothing more	Mar dambe wax ma qaban karo
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
I know where she is.	Waan ogahay meesha ay joogto.
Not for long, but.	Ma aha muddo dheer, laakiin.
What happened to you.	Wixii kugu dhacay.
I was not the only one who was surprised	Anigu ma ahayn ka kaliya ee la yaabay
Everything and nothing.	Wax walba iyo waxba.
I saw everything as well	Waxaan arkay wax walba sidoo kale
I really don't care.	Runtii waxba igama qabo.
New appointment.	Ballan cusub.
If they will let me.	Haddii ay ii ogolaan doonaan.
I am in big trouble	Waxaan ku jiraa dhibaato weyn
Like home.	Sida guriga.
It really isn’t that hard.	Runtii maaha mid adag.
You will tell me the truth.	Run baad ii sheegi doontaa.
I am here	halkaan ayaan joogaa
I wanted him to be someone else	Waxaan rabay inuu noqdo qof kale
I want to do it all for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku sameeyo dhammaan adiga
Hold on a lot.	Qabo badan.
I wonder what they like most.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ay ugu jecel yihiin.
A few things, of course	Waxyaabo yar, dhab ahaantii
Please do not talk to me.	Fadlan ha ii hadlin.
I need to know how bad it is	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida xun
They are still friends.	Wali waa saaxiibo.
I still have a lot to say to you	Weli waxaan hayaa waxyaabo badan oo aan kuu sheego
No one will do it	Qofna ma yeeli doono
Lots of real trouble	Dhibaato badan oo dhab ah
Not true	Run maaha
But I did not.	Laakiin ma samayn.

I'm sure he did	Waan hubaa inuu sameeyay
I have no idea what it is	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay

I would like to learn more from you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan kaa barto
It’s as hard as we are as people.	Way u adag tahay sida aan nahay sida dadka.
You will love it here	Waad ku jeclaan doontaa halkan
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I hope that will never happen again	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi mar dambe dhici doonin
I was not ready to talk	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan hadlo
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan.
I had nowhere else to go	Meel kale oo aan aado maan haysan
Maybe more should not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan waa in aan.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
I don't know if that is true.	Ma garanayo inay taasi run tahay.
I heard what happened today	Waxaan maqlay wixii maanta dhacay
I found it in a small house	Waxaan ka helay guriga yar
I picked it up.	Waan soo qaaday.
They were not here.	Ma aysan joogin halkan.
That can be done.	Taas waa la samayn karaa.
I guess he doesn't really like me	Waxaan filayaa inuusan runtii i jeclayn
He will never do it.	Waligiis ma yeeli doono.
I can't see	Ma arki karo
I became ready to do something	Waxaan noqday diyaar inaan wax sameeyo
I was not ready to talk about it	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan ka hadlo

Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
He refused to see her when he came home from school.	Wuu diiday inuu arko markii uu dugsiga ka yimid.
I wanted to know what it was like	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sida ay tahay
I do not know how he did it.	Ma garanayo sida uu u sameeyay.
It was very, very strange.	Waxay ahayd wax aad iyo aad yaab leh.
I will not take it anymore	Mar dambe ma qaadan doono
It doesn't look right	Wax sax ah uma eka
Not just tonight.	Caawa kaliya maaha.
He must.	Waa inuu.
Close, but not.	U dhow, laakiin ma ahan.
It's not beautiful, but this is how it should be.	Ma qurux badna, laakiin tani waa sida uu noqon lahaa.
I can do a lot	Wax badan ayaan qaban karaa
What will happen?	Maxaa dhici doona?.
I made her tell me everything	Waxaan ka dhigay inay wax walba ii sheegto
But no one is sure.	Laakiin qofna ma hubo.
I will go.	Waan tagi doonaa.
I didn't do it today.	Maanta maan samayn.
It was not you.	Adiga ma ahayn.
I found it very interesting	Waxaan ka helay mid aad u xiiso badan
Please do not do this.	Fadlan taas ha samayn.
I have nowhere to go	Meel aan aado maan helin

Everyone has something.	Qof walba wax buu leeyahay.
They will never leave.	Mar dambe kama tagi doonaan.
I think they will succeed	Waxaan filayaa inay guulaysan doonaan
I did not have time to tell you	Waqti aan kuu sheego ma helin
There was no time now.	Waqti ma jirin hadda.
There was something else.	Wax kale ayaa jiray.
I don't like that.	Ma jecli taas.
He did not get what he wanted.	Wixii uu rabay wuu heli waayay.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
He was tough, tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag, adag.
There is no beauty.	Meesha qurux ma jirto.
Not until it is retained.	Ma aha ilaa in la sii hayo.
He is really a tough guy.	Runtii waa nin adag.
I knew you needed a friend today	Waan ogaa inaad maanta u baahan tahay saaxiib
He knew he needed to tell.	Wuu ogaa inuu u baahan yahay inuu sheego.
He always left the door.	Mar walba albaabka ayuu ka bixi jiray.
Maybe this is true.	Malaha tani waa sax.
I thought he was good at that	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku fiican yahay taas
I will not be anywhere else.	Meel kale ma joogi doono.
Something else did.	Wax kale ayaa sameeyay.
If anyone knows better, please correct me.	Haddii qof si ka fiican u garanayo, fadlan i sax.
But making it was awful	Laakiin samaynta waxay ahayd mid aad u xun
I would love to know more	Aad baan u jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.

Lots of this.	In badan oo tan ah.
You will be fine here.	Halkan waad ku fiicnaan doontaa.
He must know it well.	Waa inuu si fiican u garanayaa.
It still hasn't helped me much	Weli wax badan ima caawin
I want to do it now	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadda sameeyo
I could not say anything	Waxba waan sheegi waayay
I think not.	Waxaan u malaynayaa ma.
I had him in school.	Waxaan ku lahaa isaga dugsiga.
I don't know if it is.	Ma garanayo inay tahay.
It was more than I could see.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan inta aan arkay.
For me, I am the former.	Aniga, waxaan ahay kii hore.
I did not give.	Ma siin.
smart enough.	caqli kugu filan.
I can always go to someone and tell them	Had iyo jeer qof waan u tagi karaa oo u sheegi karaa
This is not a problem right now.	Tani hadda dhib ma ahan.
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
He was given a lot of money.	Waxaa la siiyay lacag aad u badan.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
I have not been able to do that yet	Weli ma awoodin inaan taas sameeyo
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
I hope to go out and see that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan baxo oo aan arko taas
I found this here.	Tan waxaan ka helay halkan.
She refused to do so.	Way diiday inay sidaas samaysay.
I have to know what you really are	Waa inaan garanayaa waxaad dhab ahaantii tahay
I know you are, obviously you are	Waan ogahay inaad tahay, sida iska cad inaad tahay
I wish it could be found everywhere	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in meel walba laga heli karo
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
There is something I love.	Waxaa jira aniga la jeclaan karo.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
Now she had.	Hadda waxay lahayd.
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.	Dhib ma lahayn in aanay run ahayn.
Not to come back here.	Inaan halkan ku soo noqon.

I really wanted to leave.	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
I did a lot of bad things	Wax badan oo xun ayaan sameeyay
I could not do it for him	Waan u qaban waayay isaga
I haven't told anyone yet.	Weli cidna uma sheegin.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
As it turns out.	Sida ku cad.
One went out.	Mid baa baxay.
Nothing was given.	Waxba lama siin.
I had nothing	waxba maan haysan
You did this.	Waxaad samaysay tan.
I had to work hard	Waxay ahayd inaan si adag ugu shaqeeyo
I want to be with you all the time	Waxaan rabaa inaan la joogo mar walba

I really did not know anything	Runtii waxba maan garanayn
I think he really likes it here.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu runtii halkan jecel yahay.
It was never found.	Waligiis lama helin.
I could not do anything.	Waxba maan qaban karin.
It's a great place	Waa meel fiican
It's true.	Waa run.
He said I saw a lot of it.	Waxa uu yidhi wax badan baan ku arkay.
He wanted me to be there.	Wuxuu rabay inaan halkaas joogo.
We really are.	Runtii waan nahay.
And you will do it tonight.	Oo waxaad samayn doontaa caawa.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
I did not like to eat	Maan jeclayn inaan cuno

That is true.	Taasi waa run.
He did well.	Si fiican ayuu u sameeyay.
That is not what you want.	Taasi maaha waxa aad rabto.
I rejected that.	Waan diiday taas.
That was awful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Nothing, nothing.	Waxba, waxba.
This is not common.	Tani ma badna.
Mid.	Mid.
They should not be told.	Waa inaan loo sheegin.
Maybe I should not have told you that	Malaha ma ahayn inaan taas kuu sheego
He’s a friend, a friend.	Waa saaxiib, saaxiib.
I have no problem with that, it is good for you	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo taas, adiga ayaa kuu fiican
I went back and forth	Hor iyo dib ayaan ugu soo noqday
A lot of them, really.	In badan oo ka mid ah, runtii.
I think they do the same	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay sidaas oo kale u sameeyaan
Don't tell me that.	Taas ha ii sheegin.
But this.	Laakiin tan.
It took time.	Waqti ayuu qaatay.
Does he really think so.	Runtii ma sidaas buu u malaynayaa.
I think you can do great things.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad wax weyn sameyn karto.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
I can only see.	Kaliya waan arki karaa.
I have a friend	waxaan leeyahay saaxiib
I will come up with something.	Wax baan la iman doonaa.
I was there for about a year	Waxaan halkaas joogay ilaa hal sano
I think it is not interesting	Waxaan filayaa inuusan ahayn mid xiiso leh
I wanted to see what would happen	Waxaan rabay inaan arko waxa dhici doona
I was just there.	Kaliya halkaas ayaan joogay.
He knew something was going to happen.	Wuu ogaa inay wax dhici doonaan.
Something beautiful for everyone	Wax aad u qurux badan qof walba
I will get a job after school, to help.	Waxaan heli doonaa shaqo dugsiga ka dib, si aan u caawiyo.
In fact, this is not true.	Run ahaantii, tani run maaha.
I wonder what he will do now	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu hadda samayn doono
You are a good man.	Nin wanaagsan baad tahay.
I need to see you now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko hadda
Not here, where everyone would see.	Ma aha halkan, halkaas oo uu qof walba arki lahaa.
I can do nothing I love you	Waxba ma samayn karo waan ku jeclahay
I want to stay here for a while	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan sii joogo in muddo ah
I wanted to reverse that	Waxaan rabay inaan taas ka noqdo
This is not for me.	Tani aniga ma aha.
Someone will see.	Qof ayaa arki doona.
I could not tell him	Waan u sheegi waayay
Now he knew how to do it.	Hadda wuu ogaa sida loo sameeyo.
after a while.	xoogaa ka dib .
I know he wants to come home.	Waan ogahay inuu doonayo inuu guriga yimaado.
He was amazing.	Waxa uu ahaa mid la yaab leh.
I hope that is not too difficult	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi aysan ahayn mid aad u adag
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
I wondered where he was now	Waxaan la yaabay halka uu hadda joogo
I can do anything	Wax walba waan samayn karaa
She couldn't see anything.	Waxba way arki wayday.
There is a lot going on.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo socda.
I really had nothing to do	Runtii ma aanan haysan wax aan sameeyo
And certainly enough, it was.	Oo hubaal ku filan, waxay ahayd.
I think that is the most important thing to him	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay waxa ugu badan isaga
I can not see what it is	Ma arki karo waxa ay tahay
It's gone.	Waa iska baxay.
Most of the time I did not find anything interesting to talk about	Inta badan maan helin wax xiiso leh oo aan ka hadlo
When he returned, he did it in a strange way.	Marka uu soo noqdo, waxa uu samayn jiray si yaab leh.
I came up with it well	si fiican ayaan ula soo baxay
Maybe he still wants me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli i rabo.
He would love to help.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu caawiyo.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
I have to.	Waa inaan.
Even more so than before.	Xitaa in ka badan sidii hore.
I was there	waan joogay
I need you to do that for me, now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad taas ii sameyso, hadda
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
But there is no chance.	Laakiin ma jirto fursad.
I really need to have this	Runtii aad ayaan ugu baahanahay inaan tan haysto
They must be included.	Waa inay ku jiraan.
We'll see if we can handle it.	Waan arki doonaa haddii aan isaga qaban karno.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
It should not have been taken.	Ma ahayn in la qaado.
I desperately need it.	Aad ayaan ugu baahanahay.
She had to help me see.	Waxay ahayd inay iga caawiso inaan arko.
But maybe it was something else.	Laakiin malaha waxay ahayd wax kale.
He thought enough.	Wuu mooday in ku filan.
I want to know what is in it	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa ku jira
No one should ever know.	Qofna waa inuu waligiis ogaado.
I hope you enjoy it	Waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto
It can happen anywhere.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa meel kasta.
I need to get rid of all this	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan oo dhan la baxo
They just.	Waxay kaliya.
I think there will be a problem when he does	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay dhibaato dhici doonto marka uu sameeyo
I did not want to work	Maan rabin inaan shaqeeyo
It 's really good.	Runtii way fiican tahay.
I haven't really come here before but that doesn't matter	Runtii halkan hore uma iman laakiin taasi dhib ma leh
He was at home.	Guriga ayuu joogay.
I haven't seen him in a while	In muddo ah maan arag
I know you don't come back.	Waan ogahay inaadan soo noqon.
I really want to know	Run ahaantii waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
No one can even talk.	Xitaa qofna lama hadli karo.
I left	waan tagay
Again I refused.	Mar kale waan diiday.
She did not have.	Ma aysan haysan.
It looks right	Waxay u egtahay sax
And another.	Iyo mid kale.
I may be back later	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan soo noqdo goor dambe
It is not in a bad place.	Meel xun ma joogo.
I'm glad he's here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu halkan joogo.
It would not have stopped.	Lama joojin lahayn.
I would even like to work there	Xitaa waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas ka shaqeeyo
But, here it is.	Laakiin, halkan waa.
I don't know which one is bigger.	Ma garanayo mid ka weyn.
And you should not.	Oo waa inaadan.
He did not say how much it would be.	Ma uusan sheegin inta ay noqon doonto.
This can happen to any of us.	Tani waxay ku dhici kartaa mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
I reported it once	Mar baan soo sheegay
Not just any idea.	Ma aha kaliya fikrad kasta.
I would really like that	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa taas
I wondered what was in it	Waxaan la yaabay waxa ku jira
I can't do it now	Hadda maan qaban karin
I do not know what is more true	Ma garanayo waxa ka run badan
But he is still with us.	Laakiin weli wuu nala joogaa.
To help you	Si aan kuu caawiyo
I do nothing wrong.	Wax xun ma sameeyo.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I know what you need	Waan ogahay waxa aad ugu baahan tahay
I need to know how it is	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida ay tahay
But it was more than that, too.	Laakiin waxay ahayd in ka badan taas, sidoo kale.
I left a good job	Shaqo wanaagsan ayaan uga tagay
I told him a lot	Wax badan ayaan u sheegay
I have to leave a little	Waa inaan baxo wax yar
He left again.	Mar kale ayuu baxay.
I could not imagine being with a man	Maan malayn karin in aan nin la joogo
This is a good idea.	Tani waa fikrad fiican.
he wondered.	ayuu is waydiiyay.
But he had to get it right.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inuu si sax ah u helo.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
He told you.	Waxa uu kuu sheegay.
They live very well.	Waxay u nool yihiin si aad u wanaagsan.
Here is a good place.	Halkan waa meel wanaagsan.
I really can't help myself	Run ahaantii ma is caawin karo
Maybe we can really get something out of it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan runtii wax ka heli karno.
Not like me.	Aniga oo kale maaha.
When he is good, he is good.	Marka uu wanaagsan yahay, wuu fiican yahay.
I really don't like that.	Runtii sidaas uma jecli.
I think there is more than one.	Waxaan filayaa inay jiraan wax ka badan hal.
The reason is, that is the only thing you will get back.	Sababta ayaa ah, taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad dib u heli doonto.
How can it be stopped.	Sidee loo joojin karaa.
To leave something out	In wax laga tago
I really did not know what was going on	Runtii maan garanayn waxa socda
I do not think this is correct	U malayn maayo in tani sax tahay
You are a true friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib run ah.
I knew that and I never said otherwise	Waan ogaa taas oo waligiis si kale uma odhan
It was lucky.	Nasiib bay ahayd.
And got it.	Oo helay.
I know you want to	Waan ogahay in aad rabto
I was not in the room.	Qolka maan joogin.
Not everyone who might know knows.	Qof kasta oo laga yaabo inuu yaqaan ma sheegin.
I will never be the same	Weligay isku mid ahaan maayo
He is not a man.	Ma aha nin.
But you will do it when you are great.	Laakiin waxaad samayn doontaa marka aad weyn.
I did not want to leave.	Ma rabin inaan baxo.
I decided that would be it.	Waxaan go'aansaday inay taasi noqon doonto.
They may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan haysan.
Maybe I can even see him at home	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa guriga ku arko isaga
I did not get a chance.	Fursad maan helin.
I had no money.	Lacag ma haysan.
They do everything right.	Wax walba waxay u sameeyaan si sax ah.
I could not do anything about it	Waxba waan ka qaban waayay
Not much.	Ma badna.
That would be nice too.	Taasi sidoo kale way fiicnaan lahayd.
Indeed, it was.	Runtii, waxay ahayd.
She was not ready yet.	Wali diyaar uma ay ahayn.
I'm not sure it will be.	Ma hubo inay ahaan doonto.
I wish he was here with me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan ila joogo
I could not see enough to say	Wax igu filan oo aan u sheego ma aan arki karin
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I started somewhere	Meel baan ka bilaabay
I am not one of them	Anigu ka mid ma ihi
Everyone gets what they want.	Qof walba waxa uu helo.
That's what he does.	Waa waxa uu sameeyo.
I know it's bad.	Waan ogahay inay xun tahay.
I really wanted to go	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan tago
I just want to help you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I do not know where you are	Meesha aad joogto maan garanayn
It really is me.	Runtii waa aniga.
Not as you like.	Ma aha sida aad jeceshahay.
Good at homework	Ku fiican shaqada guriga
It belongs to him.	Isaga ayaa iska leh.
She could not leave.	Way ka tagi weyday.
There is not much to say.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo la sheego.
Now and then.	Hadda iyo ka dib.
Probably no one.	Malaha qofna.
I started to do it.	Waxaan bilaabay in aan sameeyo.
I think she would like it	Waxaan filayaa inay jeclaan lahayd
I wonder if that is so	Waxaan la yaabay in taasi sidaas oo kale tahay
Here is what you can do	Waa kan waxa aad sameyn karto
This can be very fast.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u degdeg badan.
I don't like being at home very much.	Aad uma jecli inaan guriga joogo.
You can stay as long as you want.	Waad joogi kartaa inta aad rabto.
The house told me so, too.	Guriga ayaa ii sheegay sidaas, sidoo kale.
I knew something bad was going to happen	Waxaan ogaa inay wax xun dhici doonaan
Get things done quickly.	Si degdeg ah wax loo sameeyo.
I would love to see this	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu tan arko
This is correct.	Tani waa sax.
He wanted to help you in any way he could.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ku caawiyo si kasta oo uu awoodo.
That is not true	Taasi run maaha
Exactly, too.	Si sax ah, sidoo kale.
I love having you here	Waxaan jeclahay inaan halkaan kugu haysto
She did something.	Wax bay samaysay.
This was done without difficulty	Taas waxaa la sameeyay dhib la'aan
Surprisingly, she did.	Waa yaab, way samaysay.
But it is not a bad thing at all.	Laakiin wax xun maaha.
I really wasn't.	Runtii ma aanan ahayn.
No one else.	Qof kale ma jiro.
Like, you can't even talk.	Sida, xitaa kama hadli kartid.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
I do not understand what it could be	Ma fahmin waxa ay noqon karto
I would give her nothing to stay	Waxba waan siin lahaa si ay u joogto
I did not like it	Maan jeclayn
That was something new.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax cusub.
I was in enough trouble.	Dhibaato igu filan ayaan ku jiray.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
You can pick it up from there.	Halkaas ayaad ka qaadan kartaa.
But that is something I can not help you with.	Laakiin taasi waa wax aanan kaa caawin karin.
I hope to see you again, soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko, dhawaan
Not so now.	Hadda sidaas ma ahayn.
We need more of that	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo taas ah
I really looked at it	Waxaan si dhab ah u eegay
I wanted many things at once	Waxaan rabay waxyaabo badan hal mar
I have no idea how difficult it is	Wax fikrad ah kama helin sida ay u adag tahay
I do not know how long it will take.	Ma garanayo inta ay qaadan doonto.
Same job, same diet.	Shaqo isku mid ah, cunto isku mid ah.
Nothing will be found.	Waxba lama heli doono.
I love you.	Ku jeclahay.
I hope they will be together for a while	Waxaan filayaa inay isla joogi doonaan in muddo ah
This will help a lot.	Tani waxay caawin doontaa wax badan.
I didn't want that.	Taas maan rabin.
Him.	Isaga.
I really wanted to see you do that again	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan ku arko inaad taas mar kale sameyso
They should.	Waa inay .
There was nothing I could do.	Wax aan sameeyo ma jirin.
But this cannot be helped.	Laakiin tan lama caawin karo.
He thinks he knows everything.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inuu wax walba garanayo.
He refused at first.	Wuu diiday marka hore.
I want to go home, he said to himself.	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga, ayuu is yidhi.
Definitely everything you want.	Dhab ahaantii wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I have heard a lot about you.	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay.
I have to go to work soon	Waa in aan shaqada aado dhawaan
Tell her it is urgent.	U sheeg inay degdeg tahay.
You do not have to.	Ma aha in aad.
It was not the same.	Isku mid ma ahayn.
I would love to see you again.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale arko.
In fact, the only.	Dhab ahaantii, ka kaliya.
I would have time for it	Waqti ayaan u heli lahaa
Something new has emerged	Wax cusub ayaa soo baxay
I told you that.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegay.
That doesn't seem right.	Taasi sax uma eka.
I don’t think she needs that.	Uma maleynayo inay u baahan tahay taas.
I was not able to do that	Anigu ma aan awoodin inaan taas sameeyo
There is nothing new here.	Ma jiro wax cusub halkan.
I have been here before.	Hore ayaan halkan u joogay.
I think I need only one	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan u baahanahay mid kaliya
Yes and no.	Waa iyo ma aha.
I will always believe that	Mar walba taas ayaan rumaysan doonaa
I think it is the best place.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay meesha uu ugu fiican yahay.
I hope you will help us	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad nagu caawin doonto
I was busy	Waxaan ahaa mashquul
I need you to be with me.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ila joogto.
Obviously I will.	Sida cad waan yeeli doonaa.
I need to know how it is	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida uu yahay
I want to talk to you first	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo marka hore
She will see that.	Way arki doontaa taas.
I found that really interesting	Waxaan ka helay taas runtii xiiso leh
Sorry about that, everyone.	Waan ka xumahay taas, qof walba.
I do not think that is true	U malayn maayo in taasi run tahay
I’ve never had that before.	Weligay taas hore uma helin.
That must have been great.	Taasi waa inay ahayd mid weyn.
Maybe I can.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo.
I can do something	wax waan samayn karaa
She needs it.	Way u baahan tahay.
It was all over me.	Waxay ahayd aniga oo dhan.
It would be good for us.	Way noo fiicnaan lahayd.
I will never stop doing it	Weligay ma joojin doono inaan sameeyo
I am very happy to be here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
Several, in fact.	Dhowr, dhab ahaantii.
I have not been able to help much	Ma awoodin inaan wax badan caawiyo
It is really beautiful here.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay halkan.
I think that would be great	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi noqon doonto mid aad u fiican
Tell us everything.	Wax walba noo sheeg.
I think that requires some work.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi u baahan tahay xoogaa shaqo ah.
But it is as it is.	Laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
I owe it to him to see	Waxaan ku leeyahay isaga si uu wax u arko
I can't let you carry too much	Ma ogolaan karo inaad qaado wax badan
.	.
I want to learn more from you	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan kaa barto
It was time for him	Waxay ahayd wakhti isaga
I tried to keep it	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sii hayo
I wonder where he is now	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka uu hadda joogo
He was there, he did.	Wuu joogay, wuu sameeyay.
I never thought anyone would do that to anyone	Uma malaynayn in qofna sidaas qof u samaynayo
That would be awful.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
I left before tomorrow.	Berri ka hor ayaan tagi.
I did not want to	Ma aanan rabin inay
Less than nothing.	In ka yar waxba.
Something has to be done.	Wax waa in la sameeyaa.
I got everything yesterday and today	Waxaan helay wax walba shalay iyo maanta
I know this is hard for you	Waan ogahay in tani ay kugu adag tahay
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan sameeyo berri
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
I will not have it anymore	Mar dambe ma haysan doono
In fact, today it looked so good.	Dhab ahaantii, maanta wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u wanaagsan.
I have said this before	Mar hore ayaan taas u sheegay wakhti hore
Everyone who comes here, everyone wants something similar.	Qof kasta oo halkan yimid, qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa wax la mid ah.
I will not see him again.	Mar dambe ma arki doono.
I really can't say what it is	Runtii ma sheegi karo waxay tahay
Most of the time I would do it	Inta badan waan qaban lahaa
No problem to report.	Dhibaato ma jirto in la soo sheego.
I got time	Waqti ayaan helay
I was a new person.	Waxaan ahaa qof cusub.
I think she is in a bad mood	Waxaan filayaa inay niyad xun ku jirto
Also, she was more than one person.	Sidoo kale, waxay ahayd wax badan hal qof.
I think this was a bad idea	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ahayd fikrad xun
I hope you will do something amazing	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax yaab leh samayn doonto
To have and not to have.	In la haysto oo aan haysan.
How man became what he is today.	Sidee nin ku noqday waxa uu maanta yahay.
It certainly will not come.	Dhab ahaantii ma iman doono.
I had no idea you could do this.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaad tan samayn karto.
He did the same.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayuu sameeyay.
I had to say she already had	Waxay ahayd inaan sheego inay hore u lahayd
need.	u baahan.
I want to work	Waxaan rabaa inaan shaqeeyo
It is not a new problem.	Dhibaato cusub maaha.
We will be better tomorrow.	Berri ayaan fiicnaan doonaa.
I didn't think it was that hard	Uma malaynayn inay sidaas u adag tahay
I got that.	Waxaan helay taas.
He used to say the same thing to me.	Waxa uu u sheegi jiray si la mid ah waxa uu ii sheegay.
We just love people.	Waxaan kaliya jecel nahay dadka.
A real new idea	Fikrad cusub oo dhab ah
It is something new.	Waa wax cusub.
I'm sure they will do it soon	Waxaan aad u hubaa inay dhawaan qaban doonaan
Very little.	Aad u yar .
As far as I know.	Inta aan ka ogahay.
This is a new idea for me.	Tani waa fikrad igu cusub.
How is it done?	Sidee loo sameeyaa?.
I wanted to go to school	Waxaan rabay inaan aado dugsiga
A man came into the room	Nin baa qolka soo galay
I can not stay there	Ma sii joogi karo halkaas
Several there.	Dhowr halkaas.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Several cars here and there	Dhowr baabuur halkan iyo halkaas
But there are other things she can do.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo ay sameyn karto.
I felt a little	Waxaan dareemay wax yar
We live in one.	Waxaan ku nool nahay hal.
He should have known better, really.	Waxay ahayd inuu si fiican u yaqaan, runtii.
I will not return.	Soo noqon maayo.
I thought he would get a lot	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu heli doono wax badan
After that, it would all be over.	Taas ka dib, dhammaan way dhammaan lahayd.
I knew that would happen.	Waan ogaa in taasi dhici doonto.
I want to do this for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan kuu sameeyo
He thought he was older.	Wuxuu mooday inuu ka weyn yahay.
There has been a period.	Waxaa jiray muddo.
I did that early.	Waxaan taas sameeyay goor hore.
I went a little farther	In yar ayaan aaday
You and someone else.	Adiga iyo qof kale.
I think he was tough, wherever he came from	Waxaan filayaa inuu ahaa mid adag, meel kasta oo uu ka yimid
I had to keep you	Waxay ahayd in aan ku sii hayo
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
I just need to be with you	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula joogo
She did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
But only if you want me.	Laakiin kaliya haddii aad i rabto.
Still, he never got enough money.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, waligiis ma helin lacag ku filan.
I love working with you	Waxaan jeclahay in aan kula shaqeeyo
That he can do it.	In uu samayn karo.
That is why he will not return.	Taasi waa sababta uusan u soo noqon doonin.
I will get and take any job, first	Waan heli doonaa oo qaadan doonaa shaqo kasta, marka hore
He is an amazing person.	Waa qof yaab leh.
I saw him recently	Waxaan arkay isaga dhawaan
I will not tell you that	Anigu taas u sheegi maayo
Please do not leave me.	Fadlan ha iga tagin.
I have never seen him go so fast	Weligay ma arag isaga oo si degdeg ah u socda
I am so glad you are here with me	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad halkan ila joogto
I promised I would do the same	Waxaan ballan qaaday inaan sidaas oo kale samayn doono
They are really the only people you can say that about.	Runtii waa dadka kaliya ee aad taas ka odhan karto.
And as you can tell, it's obvious.	Oo sida aad sheegi karto, waa wax iska cad.
But he said.	Laakiin wuu yidhi.
I should have known it would not be	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaysan ahaan doonin
So far, so good.	Ilaa hadda, waa sax.
I want you to do exactly what you want	Waxaan rabaa inaad si sax ah u sameyso waxaad rabto
I love you so much every day	Aad iyo aad ayaan kuu jeclahay maalin kasta
I think that is not surprising	Waxaan filayaa in aanay taasi la yaab ahayn
I was something else but, really	Waxaan ahaa wax kale laakiin, runtii
It is enough.	Waa ku filan yahay.
After all, not so much.	Taas ka dib, ma aha wax aad u badan.
I can see that no one has	Waxaan arki karaa in qofna uusan haysan
I know everyone wants to know	Waan ogahay in qof kastaa rabo inuu ogaado
I have not found everything yet	Wax walba weli maan helin
I want to know why you did this	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta aad tan u samaysay
"I did it," he said.	waan sameeyay ayuu is yidhi.
I can't leave, yet	Ma bixi karin, weli
We are just friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo kaliya.
There is no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma jiro.
I do not know who she is	Ma garanayo cidda ay tahay
No one knows where he went.	Qofna ma garanayo meel uu aaday.
She did.	Way samaysay.
Not when she would love him once.	Ma aha markii ay isaga jeclaan lahayd hal mar.
I have never seen anything so beautiful	Weligay ma arag wax aad u qurux badan
I really want a new one	Runtii waxaan rabaa mid cusub
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani run maaha.
I have not been here for a while	In muddo ah halkan maan joogin
I would like to go back with you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula noqdo.
I would not allow that	Ma ogolaan lahaa taas
I am a good man. 	Waxaan ahay nin wanaagsan. 
no luck.	nasiib ma leh.
I quickly decided not to tell him	Waxaan si degdeg ah u go'aansaday inaanan u sheegin
We were friends, you know.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo, waad ogtahay.
Not really sure what to do.	Runtii ma hubo waxaan sameeyo.
I hope you found out more.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad wax badan ka ogaatay.
not you.	ma adiga.
I really can't say	Dhab ahaan ma odhan karo
And I need to.	Oo waxaan u baahanahay inaan.
I love how everyone works.	Waxaan jeclahay sida qof walba u shaqeeyo.
It looks smaller.	Waxay u egtahay mid ka yar.
Everything.	Wax kasta.
Posted together.	La soo wada dhigay.
He is here now.	Hadda wuu joogaa.
I did not want to talk about this	Ma aanan rabin inaan ka hadlo arrintan
A little longer.	Wax yar ka sii dheer.
I clearly did not understand anything.	Si cad wax uma fahmin.
Several times, in fact.	Dhowr jeer, dhab ahaantii.
I always cooked for him	Mar walba isaga ayaan u karin jiray
Mostly.	Inta badan.
Very well known.	Aad baa loo yaqaan.
Maybe we can get it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan heli karno.
I looked a lot	In badan baan eegay
You will love it.	Waad ku jeclaan doontaa.
Most of us are.	Inta badan waxaan nahay.
Just tell them you do.	Kaliya u sheeg inaad samaynayso.
I will leave soon.	mar dhow waan bixi doonaa.
That doesn't seem too difficult.	Taasi uma eka mid aad u adag.
I really want him to be a good man	Waxaan aad u rabaa inuu noqdo nin wanaagsan
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I could not believe he wanted me	Ma rumaysan karin inuu i doonayo
I did not understand.	Ma aanan fahmin.
I had to see something.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax arko.
This is also true.	Tani sidoo kale waa sax.
I had an exciting time	Waxaan lahaa waqti xiiso leh
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
I'm sure he looked.	Waan hubaa inuu eegay.
I am a real person.	Waxaan ahay qof dhab ah.
I think it is known so far.	Waxay ila tahay in la yaqaan ilaa hadda.
I really did not know that	Runtii taas maan ogayn
A little to do.	Wax yar oo la sameeyo.
You will need him now.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa isaga hadda.
I told her she was so beautiful	Waxaan u sheegay inay aad u qurux badan tahay
You cannot be him.	Isaga ma noqon kartid.
I still can't do that.	Taas weli ma samayn karo.
I think it is a bit smaller	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu xoogaa ka yar yahay
I am still afraid of the unknown	Weli waxaan ka baqayaa wax aan la garanayn
I wanted to know more about you.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan kaa ogaado.
He no longer found anything.	Mar dambe waxba kama uu helin.
I don't see how you can say otherwise.	Ma arko sida aad si kale u odhan karto.
Each of us.	Qof kasta oo naga mid ah.
It is the same.	Waa isku mid.
It was not.	Ma aysan ahayn.
But it is better than anything else.	Laakiin way ka fiican tahay wax kasta oo kale oo jira.
There is nothing you can do.	Wax aad qaban karto ma jirto.
The reason for this is unknown	Sababta loo sameeyay lama garanayo
This was nonsense.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aan jirin.
Doing the same job.	Samaynta shaqo isku mid ah.
Maybe he can still talk about how to get out of this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli ka hadli karo sidii uu tan uga bixi lahaa.
I can't lie.	Been ma sheegi karo.
This is really what happened to us.	Runtii tani waa waxa nagu dhacay.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ma garanayo waxa ku dhacay.
We are exactly the same in every way.	Dhab ahaan waan isku mid nahay si walba.
I didn't want to break up now	Ma rabin inaan hadda kala tago
I have nothing else.	Wax kale ma hayo.
This is not a new idea.	Tani maaha fikrad cusub.
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono
not ready	diyaar uma aha
I want to be left alone	Waxaan rabaa in la iga tago
I should not have been here	Ma ahayn inaan halkan joogo
I had nothing really	Waxba maan haysan runtii
You promised to get it.	Waxaad ballan qaaday inaad heli doonto.
Everything is fine.	Wax walba way ku fiican yihiin.
No one is very happy.	Ma jiro mid aad ugu faraxsan.
He knows.	Wuu garanayaa.
made	la sameeyay
I really enjoyed it once.	Aad ayaan hal mar uga helay.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
Not you.	Adiga maaha.
I can't see the door	Ma arki karo albaabka
He was a very strange little man.	Nin yar oo aad u yaab badan ayuu ahaa.
He put it.	Wuu dhigay.
Said a great man.	Nin weyn bay tidhi.
I was just the same.	Waxaan ahaa kaliya isku mid.
I will help you	waan ku caawin doonaa
He did not do it again.	Mar dambe ma uu samayn.
Here is why.	Waa kan sababta.
It looks like another beautiful place.	Waxay u egtahay meel kale oo qurux badan.
It's a problem even a little bit.	Waa dhib xitaa in yar.
I can find another job there	Waxaan halkaas ka heli karaa shaqo kale
He has to go.	Waa inuu aado.
I thought someone was in big trouble	Waxaan u maleeyay in qof dhibaato weyn ku jiro
It is, it is, it is.	Waa, waa, waa.
Adag.	Adag.
I wanted to be able to say	Waxaan rabay inaan awoodo inaan sheego
I no longer wanted to	Mar dambe ma rabin
I did not want to know	Maan rabin inaan ogaado
It is difficult for me to go anywhere.	Way igu adag tahay inaan meel kasta aado.
It was to be expected.	Waxay ahayd wax la rajaynayo.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma yeeli doono
I need to get out a lot	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan ka baxo
I should not have gone	Ma ahayn inaan tago
I knew you would be fine	Waan ogaa inaad fiicnaan doonto
There was so much today.	Maanta wax badan baa jiray.
I did not know how long it would take	Ma garanayn inta uu qaadan doono
As you do.	Sida aad sameyso.
He was not ready.	Diyaar uma ahayn.
I wondered what he hoped to get out of it	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu rajaynayo in uu ka helo
And other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale.
Not like now.	Ma aha sida hadda.
I was all there	Halkaas ayaan joogay oo dhan
I have to tell them what happened	Waa inaan u sheego waxa dhacay
I have other things	Waxyaabo kale ayaan hayaa
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
I don't know why he did that.	Ma garanayo sababta uu sidaas u sameeyay.
I heard it clearly.	Si cad ayaan u maqlay.
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
I still think so.	Weli taas ayaan qabaa.
Still no one does.	Wali qofna ma sameeyo.
No one else can talk right now.	Qof kale lama hadli karo hadda.
I need to know	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado
A little beautiful as.	Wax yar oo qurux badan sida.
I would love to do that today	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan maanta taas samayno
A little while ago, maybe	Wax yar ka hor, malaha
That's how it is done.	Taasi waa sida loo sameeyo.
That is the most common.	Taasi waa tan ugu badan.
No one here is ready to help.	Ma jiro qof halkan diyaar u ah inuu caawiyo.
It's great.	Way weyn tahay.
I would really like to see that	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko
I can't see it's available.	Ma arki karo in la heli karo.
And not just any idea.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya fikrad kasta.
I am happy with that	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas
You don't want to do that.	Ma rabto inaad taas samayso.
That is why he came back.	Taasi waa sababta uu u soo noqday.
But someone else has to do it.	Laakiin qof kale waa inuu sameeyaa.
I really wish that would have been better	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay taasi si ka sii fiicnaan lahayd
It will catch you.	Way ku qaban doontaa.
I know it's in you	Waan ogahay inay kugu jirto
I would do more	Wax badan ayaan sameyn lahaa
I knew it was very difficult	Waan ogaa inay aad u adag tahay
But it is enough.	Laakiin way ku filan tahay.
He was not a very good person	Ma ahayn qof aad u fiican
This is really great.	Tani runtii waa mid aad u fiican.
I will do a lot of good there	Wax badan oo wanaagsan ayaan halkaas ku samayn doonaa
He told me he would come back to find me.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu soo noqon doono si uu ii helo.
I will never get anything.	Weligay waxba ma heli doono.
There is no such thing.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah.
He felt it was right.	Waxa uu dareemay in ay sax tahay.
Both are good.	Labaduba way fiican yihiin.
You can see.	Waad arki kartaa.
I've always been here, he said to himself	Mar walba halkan ayaan joogay, ayuu is yidhi
It looks like he is someone else.	Waxay u egtahay inuu qof kale yahay.
I did, a lot.	Waan sameeyay, wax badan.
She had no idea, really, what it was.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan, runtii, waxa ay tahay.
I love you so much, and	aad baan kuu jeclahay, iyo
I'm very scared to face it	Aad baan uga baqayaa inaan ka hor yimaado
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ilaa hadda lama garanayo inta weli nool.
I think he would love to see you	Waxaan filayaa inuu jeclaan lahaa inuu ku arko
That was how he knew she would be here.	Taas oo ahayd sida uu ku ogaa inay halkan joogi doonto.
I wanted it to stay that way.	Waxaan rabay in ay sidaas ku joogto.
I don't want it now	Ma rabo hadda
I can't do it fast	Si degdeg ah uma samayn karo
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I hope you do too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale sameyso.
I know very well how to say it.	Aad baan u garanayaa sida loo sheego.
This is not true, although they are often the same.	Tani run maaha, in kasta oo ay inta badan isku mid yihiin.
If he is still here.	Haddii uu weli halkan joogo.
It was everything.	Waxay ahayd wax walba.
I can't help it	Ma caawin karo
There was to be more.	Waxay ahayd in wax badan la helo.
I tried many times to get it but did not get it	In badan ayaan isku dayay in aan helo laakiin ma helin
I thought you said something	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad wax u sheegtay
I tried.	Waan isku dayay.
But not today.	Laakiin maanta maaha.
I just want to see	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko
He never came out.	Waligiis uma uu soo bixin.
I will not give it a chance	Anigu fursad ma siin doono
I will be there for you	halkaas ayaan kuu joogi doonaa
See here how to help !.	Halkan ka arag sida loo caawiyo!.
It could really be one of us	Runtii waxay noqon kartaa mid naga mid ah
I got something for you	Wax baan ku helay
It would be nice to leave.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaan baxo.
First you have to talk.	Marka hore waa in la hadlo.
He had no idea he would come	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inuu iman doono
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
I need to go home a bit	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan guriga aado xoogaa
Once something is available, it is available.	Mar haddii wax jiro, waa la heli karaa.
I don't want to keep you anymore	Ma jecli inaan mar dambe ku sii hayo
I could not stay here	Halkan kuma sii joogi karin
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
Correct me.	Sax aniga ila.
I saw it clearly	Si cad ayaan u arkay
It just isn't true.	Kaliya maaha run.
There is nothing here.	Halkan waxba ma jiraan.
But that is a lie.	Laakiin taasi waa been.
It is everywhere now.	Waa meel walba hadda.
He did not go every day	Maalin walba ma tagi jirin
I wanted to say it, badly	Waxaan rabay inaan u sheego, si xun
He would not stay long.	Muddo dheer ma uu joogi lahaa.
I fell in love with him	Waan la dhacay isaga
When it is good.	Marka ay wanaagsan tahay.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ma garanayo waxa ku dhacay.
Each one	Mid kasta
This was something he was not ready for.	Tani waxay ahayd wax uusan diyaar u ahayn.
It was me, just me.	Waxay ahayd aniga, aniga oo kaliya.
I would help him.	Waan caawin lahaa isaga.
Fresh food is better.	Cunto cusub ayaa ka sii fiican.
I do not believe	Maan rumaysan
I would really like to be your friend too	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sidoo kale saaxiib kuu noqdo
Maybe he is right.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu sax yahay.
Certainly not.	Run ahaantii sidaas maaha.
But she did not speak.	Laakiin ma aysan hadlin.
There is a problem.	Waxaa jira dhib.
I really know who you are	Runtii waan garanayaa qofka aad tahay
We can't be right.	Ma noqon karno si sax ah.
You have to do your best.	Waa inaad sameyso waxa ugu wanaagsan.
I looked a little hard	Waxaan eegay xoogaa adag
This is not new.	Tani maaha mid cusub.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
I knew nothing	Anigu waxba maan garanayn
It would not be money.	Lacag ma ahaan lahayd.
I have very good friends	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo aad u wanaagsan
I saw a lot of him	Wax badan baan ka arkay isaga
I am very sorry about that	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
But they did not come.	Laakiin ma ay iman.
I thought you wanted more	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad rabto in aad ka badan tahay
Now that is not true.	Hadda taasi sax maaha.
After a while, he came back	Wax yar ka dib, wuu soo noqday
This is where I go.	Tani waa meesha aan tago.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
Do something about it.	Wax ka qabo.
I wanted to know something	Waxaan rabay in aan wax ogaado
I had a hard time talking to him.	Dhib ayaan u helay fursad aan kula hadlo.
I know the only place	Waan ogahay meesha kaliya
I want to talk about this.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo arrintan.
You know.	Waad ogtahay.
I could no longer see	Wax dambe maan arki karin
He made it bad.	Wuxuu ka dhigay mid xun.
The whole room is in a good place.	Qolka oo dhan waa meel wanaagsan.
I also applied for one	Mid ayaan sidoo kale codsaday
I have everything.	Wax walba waan hayaa.
I do not like to say	Ma jecli inaan sheego
I saw that you were in trouble	Waxaan arkay inaad dhibaato ku jirto
I just need to get out	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
It’s amazing how he gets things done.	Waxaa la yaab leh sida uu wax u helo.
We can't separate.	Ma kala tagi karno.
I have no idea how good it is	Wax fikrad ah kama helin sida ay u fiican tahay
The reason is unknown.	Sababta lama garanayo.
I wanted to leave for a while	Waxa aan rabay in aan yara baxo
We are loved.	Waa nala jecel yahay.
I think that's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi u wanaagsan tahay.
I can't do that again	Taas mar kale ma samayn karo
It was there.	Halkaas bay ahayd.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
In the same way.	Si la mid ah.
I don't understand, really.	Ma fahmin, runtii.
Maybe she does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas sameyso.
If not, it doesn't matter.	Haddii aysan ahayn, waxba maaha.
Everything else is false.	Wixii kale waa been.
I don't understand anymore.	kuma fahmin mar dambe.
But very hard to find.	Laakiin aad u adag in la helo.
It is true that not everyone understands that.	Waa run in qof kastaa aanu taas fahmin.
She said she was sorry I couldn't do it.	Waxay sheegtay inay ka xun yihiin inaanan sameyn karin.
I will leave	Aniga ayaa iga bixi doona
I don't know what else it could be.	Ma garanayo waxa kale oo ay noqon karto.
Now nothing again.	Hadda waxba mar kale.
I don't see any problem with that.	Wax dhib ah uma arko taas.
I have no one.	Qofna ma haysto.
I did not want to be left behind	Ma rabin in la iga tago
To.	Si ay u.
There are things you can do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aad sameyn kartid.
I think it will take some time.	Waxaan filayaa inay qaadan doonto wakhti.
I think this is really true.	Waxaan filayaa in tani runtii tahay mid sax ah.
You love the person you love.	Waxaad jeceshahay qofka aad jeceshahay.
I am not doing this	Anigu ma samaynayo tan
Here it is again, a little revised.	Halkan waa mar kale, in yar oo dib loo eegay.
We cannot take it as it could be otherwise.	Ma qaadan karno sida ay noqon karto si kale.
I could not do it	Ma yeeli karin
But, it was not.	Laakiin, ma jirin.
I have a lot to work on first	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan marka hore ka shaqeeyo
"It's been a long day," he said	Maalin dhan baa ka baxay ayuu is yidhi
I just can't find it	Kaliya ma heli karo
But only a little.	Laakiin in yar oo kaliya.
Do not separate.	Ha kala tagin.
I did nothing wrong	Wax xun maan samayn
But that was not the only reason.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn sababta kaliya.
It is too long.	Aad bay u dheer tahay.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
I love how things are now.	Waan jeclahay sida hadda wax yihiin.
I will never leave him	Weligay isaga lama bixi doono
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
And just not every problem.	Oo kaliya ma aha dhibaato kasta.
I really don't know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
She is good at it.	Way ku fiican tahay.
It was not enough.	Ma ahayn mid ku filan.
I did not want to talk	Maan rabin inaan hadlo
If not, fine.	Haddii aysan ahayn, fiican.
I was small	Waxaan ahaa mid yar
This is not just me.	Tani aniga kaliya maaha.
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
Only one.	Mid kaliya.
I cant	Ma awoodo
I would do nothing, he said.	Waxba waan samayn lahaa, ayuu yidhi.
I felt for sure I would not do it	Waxaan dareemay hubaal inaanan yeeli doonin
He has it all.	Waxa uu leeyahay dhan.
And he never did anything after that	Oo waligiis waxba ma uu samayn ka dib
is	waa
I want to say it again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale sheego
I lost a lot of time from him	Waqti badan ayaan ka waayay isaga
Only with a friend.	Isaga oo kaliya la saaxiib.
This was a problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhibaato.
I can be whatever you want me to be	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta oo aad rabto inaan noqdo
I want you to like it here	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkan ku jeceshahay
It was not given to who she was.	Lama siin qofka ay tahay.
As much as you like.	Inta aad jeceshahay.
I can't say anything good.	Wax fiican kama odhan karo.
I do not know why they will do this	Ma garanayo sababta ay tan u samayn doonaan
It will still need time	Waxay weli u baahan doontaa waqti
I knew he could do that	Waan ogaa inuu taas samayn karo
I did not get it right	Si sax ah uma helin
And now he would expect to know everything.	Oo hadda wuxuu filan lahaa inuu wax walba ogaado.
I had to stay.	Waxay ahayd inaan ku sii jiro.
I dont understand	Maan fahmin
And it is still a problem.	Oo weli waa dhibaato.
I think you need some food.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad u baahan tahay xoogaa cunto ah.
I wanted to talk to him	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo
I always wanted to know	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan ogaado
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
No one wanted to.	Qofna ma rabin.
There is so much.	Waxaa jira wax aad u badan.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
It is one of them.	Waa mid ka mid ah.
So far, nothing new.	Ilaa hadda, ma jiraan wax cusub.
Everyone else did the same.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa sidaas oo kale sameeyay.
I gave you a lot of time	Waxaan ku siiyay waqti badan
This he wanted.	Tani wuu rabay.
I had no choice but to leave home	Maan haysan wax kale oo aan ka ahayn in aan ka tago guriga
This is very complicated.	Tani waa mid aad u dhib badan.
He may leave here	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu halkan ka tago
I will come back to pick you up	Waan soo noqon doonaa si aan ku soo qaado
It was a good day all along.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan oo dhan.
It is what he wants to do.	Waa waxa uu rabo inuu sameeyo.
But there is more, and more every day.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan, iyo ka badan maalin kasta.
I decided to find out what it is	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan ogaado waxa ay tahay
I want you to be here with me, like this	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan ila joogto, sida tan
I did not know what was going on.	Ma garanayn waxa socda.
Maybe she said something.	Malaha wax bay tidhi.
I have been here before	Hore ayaan halkan u joogay
I came back	waan soo noqday
I really have to go now	Runtii waa inaan aado hadda
I knew what to do.	Waan ogaa waxa la samayn lahaa.
That was not me.	Taasi aniga ma ahayn.
I once did this.	Mar ayaan tan sameeyay.
What is not, is not.	Waxa aan ahayn, ma aha.
I do not know that.	Ma garanayo taas.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
One known fact	Mid la yaqaan run ahaantii
It looks very interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
This can also be.	Tani waxay sidoo kale noqon kartaa.
I wish he was there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu joogo
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
There was something very good.	Wax aad u fiican baa jiray.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
It looks amazing.	Waxay u egtahay wax yaab leh.
There was nothing I could do.	Wax aan sameeyo ma jirin.
I think it will come back to me	Waxaan filayaa inay igu soo noqon doonto
It can be done, and it can be done well.	Waa la samayn karaa, oo si fiican ayaa loo samayn karaa.
He is now one of us.	Hadda waa mid naga mid ah.
I can't believe what's going on	Ma rumaysan karo waxa socda
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
I love people here	Waxaan jeclahay dadka halkan
I have never seen that before	Weligay taas hore uma arag
They love me.	Way i jecel yihiin.
I did not give	Ma siin
would not do.	ma yeeli lahayn.
He was constant.	Waxa uu ahaa mid joogto ah.
I have it everywhere	Meel walba waan hayaa
Very much needed.	Mid aad loo baahan yahay.
There was so much.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u badan.
I did it quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaan u sameeyay.
I can't even believe this.	Xitaa tan ma rumaysan karo.
I didn't have to	Ma ahayn inaan sameeyo
What really happened is something else again.	Waxa dhab ahaantii dhacay waa wax kale mar kale.
I also have a surprise for you today	Waxa kale oo aan maanta kuu hayaa yaab
Enough now.	Ku filan hadda.
IAM	waxaan ahay
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
I decided not to tell anyone	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan cidna u sheegin
It's free.	Waa lacag la'aan.
I did not want to pick it up	Maan rabin inaan soo qaado
Very smart and very smart.	Caqli badan oo aad u caqli badan.
That is a great idea.	Taasi waa fikrad aad u fiican.
I decided.	Aniga ayaa go’aansaday.
Every day.	Maalin kasta.
And money, too.	Iyo lacag, sidoo kale.
He wants to leave.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu baxo.
I have to see him.	Waa inaan arko isaga.
He knows he said it too.	Wuu ogyahay in uu aad u yidhi.
I need to talk to him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo
I fell and I fell very much	Waan dhacay oo aad baan u dhacay
Here and there, everywhere.	Halkan iyo halkaas, meel kasta.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad u qurux badan tahay.
Tell me now.	Hadda ii sheeg .
I picked it up and looked at it	Waan soo qaaday oo eegay
I started at the door	Albaabka ayaan ka bilaabay
I'm glad you are.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad tahay adiga.
And what do you think ?.	Oo maxaad u malaynaysaa?.
As you did.	Sida aad samaysay.
Because, he already did.	Sababta oo ah, wuxuu hore u sameeyay.
You will see tomorrow, you said.	Berri baad arki doontaa, waxaad tidhi.
I would love to be there, when you do.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas joogo, marka aad sameyso.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
I want nothing more	Wax kale ma rabo
I wanted to know what he knew.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa uu garanayo.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
She was given what she wanted.	Waxa la siiyay waxa ay rabto.
Maybe not bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan si xun.
I did not have to say much	Ma ahayn inaan wax badan sheego
I'm sorry, that's too bad to say.	Waan ka xumahay, taasi waa wax aad u xun in la sheego.
I could not come to you	Waan kuu iman waayay
I need to see.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko.
I went back and forth	Hor iyo hor iyo dib ayaan u noqday
I knew how it would affect him	Waan ogaa sida ay isaga u qaban doonto
It will not be the only thing.	Ma noqon doonto waxa kaliya.
I still do not understand	Wali ma fahmin
Maybe I will find him saying something very interesting.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ka heli doono inuu sheego wax aad u xiiso badan.
Like, we had a lot of friends.	Sida, waxaan lahayn saaxiibo badan.
I was not able to be seen	Ma awoodin in la i arko
I am still there	wali waan joogaa
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
I will get it if it is	Waan heli doonaa haddii ay tahay
I think otherwise.	Waxaan qabaa si kale.
That is just like you.	Taasi waa adiga oo kale.
I would like to help you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kaa caawiyo
Well done !.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay!.
A little now.	Wax yar hadda.
you did nothing.	waxba ma aadan samayn.
I did not like it	Maan jeclayn
It will be fine	Way fiicnaan doontaa
That's why she didn't get it.	Taasi waa sababta ay u heli weyday.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
And he wanted to find another place to work.	Oo wuxuu rabay inuu helo meel kale oo uu ka shaqeeyo.
I wanted to tell you	Waxaan rabay inaan kuu sheego
I do not know what else you can expect.	Ma garanayo waxa kale oo aad filan karto.
They will come out.	Way soo bixi doonaan.
And sorry for what happened.	Oo ka xumahay wixii dhacay.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
Whether they like it or not.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin iyo haddii kale.
I still think that is true.	Weli waxaan qabaa inay taasi run tahay.
I knew it was so much more than that	Waan ogaa inuu aad uga badan yahay taas
I divorced the buyer	Waxaan kala tagay kii iibsaday
More than anything, he wanted to see it again.	Wax kasta oo ka badan, wuxuu rabay inuu mar kale arko.
Not too early, not too early.	Ma aha goor hore, ma aha goor hore.
He told her.	Wuxuu u sheegay.
I did not know it was found	Maan ogeyn in la helay
Nin.	Nin.
Too long, he thought.	Aad u dheer, ayuu u maleeyay.
I hope you can help me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad iga caawin karto
It was very.	Aad bay u ahayd.
I looked everywhere, but there was none	Meel walba waan eegay, laakiin ma jirto
That is ready to go	Taasi waa diyaar in la tago
It is here and now.	Waa halkan iyo hadda.
I knew she would be there	Waan ogaa inay halkaas joogi doonto
It should be for a while.	Waa in muddo ah.
Please can you tell me how to do it.	Fadlan ma ii sheegi kartaa sida loo sameeyo.
I hope one of us finds one of us	Waxaan rajeynayaa in mid naga mid ah uu helo mid naga mid ah
Which may have been true.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay run ahayd.
I'm not sure it's right.	Ma hubo inay sax tahay.
And so does everyone else, including you, where they live.	Oo sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale, oo aad ku jirto, meesha ay ku nool yihiin.
I would love it.	Aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I could not do such a thing	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma aan samayn karin
Everything is still the same.	Wax walba weli waa isku meel.
Maybe I will have more time to study.	Malaha waxaan heli doonaa wakhti badan oo aan wax ku barto.
It was true, too.	Waxay ahayd run, sidoo kale.
I need to be with him now.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la joogo hadda.
I think he will definitely do it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dhab ahaantii sameyn doono.
I want you to be with me	Waxaan rabaa inaad ila joogto
I like to have more than one	Waxaan jeclahay inaan haysto wax ka badan hal
This was obvious.	Tani waxay ahayd mid cad.
I could not do that	Ma aan samayn karin taas
I would definitely be here again.	Dhab ahaantii halkan mar kale ayaan joogi lahaa.
He never had.	Waligiis ma lahayn.
I told you.	waan kuu sheegay.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
It was an amazing idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad la yaab leh.
He asked me to find a job.	Waxa uu iga codsaday in aan shaqo helo.
I found it everywhere	Meel walba waan ka helay
I wish he wasn't there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuusan halkaas joogin
I wonder if it is new	Waxaan la yaabanahay inuu cusub yahay
That's what you are.	Waa waxa aad u tahay.
The former.	Kii hore.
I would also like to get to know you	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclaan lahaa inaan ku barto
That 'is found.	In' waa la helay.
I looked good	Si fiican ayaan u eegay
I know what's going on here.	Waan ogahay waxa halkan ka socda.
It is what you are.	Waa waxa aad tahay.
I hope you can help me find out.	Waxaan filayaa inaad iga caawin karto inaan ogaado.
You need to do this to help us.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad taas samayso si aad noo caawiso.
I did not see him walking.	Maan arag isaga oo socda.
But he did not.	Laakiin ma uusan lahayn.
I hope you have good money.	Waxaan rajeynayaa lacag fiican.
It is closer.	Waa ka sii dhow.
I thought it would come out.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ka soo bixi doonto.
That was a good and bad time.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti fiican oo xun.
A very smart man once told me	Nin aad u caqli badan ayaa mar ii sheegay
Not bad.	Ma aha wax xun.
I got something	wax baan helay
People like me.	Dadka aniga oo kale ah.
I think we are not the same, but still	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaanan isku mid ahayn, laakiin weli
I was one a few years ago	Waxaan ahaa mid ilaa dhowr sano ka hor
I didn't think it was all over	Uma malaynayn in ay dhan tahay
Still, he could not.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, wuu awoodi waayay.
No one sees it.	Qofna ma arko.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Waxaan si sax ah u ogaa waxa dhici doona
I wish he was here now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu hadda halkan joogo
I do not understand why she wants to do this.	Ma fahmin sababta ay u rabto inay tan sameyso.
I can give you a job	Waxaan ku siin karaa shaqo
They could not afford to do that	Uma ogolaan karin inay taas sameeyaan
But I can't.	Laakiin ma awoodo.
I'll be fine, you'll see	Waan fiicnaan doonaa, waad arki doontaa
It is still here	Wali waa halkan
You have to promise me.	Waa in aad ii ballan qaado.
I was busy before	Waxaan ahaa mashquul mar hore
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
Not a bad idea.	Maaha fikrad xun.
You are a person like me.	Waxaad tahay qof aniga oo kale ah.
I would be fine	Waan fiicnaan lahaa
Maybe he was really smart.	Waxa laga yaabaa in uu dhab ahaantii ahaa mid caqli badan.
I thought he came and went.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu yimid oo baxay.
I have to do the same, he said to himself	Waa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyaa, ayuu is yidhi
Maybe even more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa wax ka badan.
I know what to do	Waan ogahay waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo
That is why he will not return.	Taasi waa sababta uusan u soo noqon doonin.
Not mentioned	Lama sheegin
you are busy	mashquul baad tahay
Maybe that was it.	Ma laga yaabaa inay taasi ahayd.
He has to leave.	Waa inuu baxo.
I did not understand anything	Waxba maan fahmin
I have no job.	shaqo ma hayo.
I think that is very interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay tahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
I just need to get out	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
That's what he did.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyay.
He went there.	Halkaas ayuu aaday.
I never got it.	Weligay ma helin.
You need as who.	Waxaad u baahan tahay sida yaa.
I didn't have much money.	Ma haysan lacag badan.
I know you are not.	Waan ogahay inaadan ahayn.
I really enjoyed it here	Runtii halkan aad ayaan uga helay
I used to be one of them	Mar baan ka mid ahaan jiray
So that we do not do the same.	Si aanu sidaas oo kale ugu samayn.
You can go anywhere	Meel kasta waad aadi kartaa
I am very sure of that.	Aad ayaan u hubaa taas.
Maybe I can help you with that	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan taas kaa caawin karo
No problem, he said.	Dhib malaha ayuu yidhi.
', and it'.	', oo waa'.
I really did not want to be here	Runtii ma rabin inaan halkan joogo
You are very new to this.	Aad baad ugu cusub tahay kan.
not ready for you.	diyaar uma ahayn adiga.
I have no idea who they are	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo cidda ay yihiin
Everything else is nonsense.	Wax kasta oo kale waa wax aan xiiso lahayn.
She likes that.	Way jeceshahay taas.
I know it does	Waan ogahay inay igu samaynayso
There is giving, and there is taking.	Waxaa jira siin, iyo waxaa jira qaadan.
I got a lot more	Waxaan helay wax badan oo kale
Available.	Oo la heli karo.
I want to see if it can be done.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko haddii la samayn karo.
Let us know.	Noo soo sheeg.
I need to see him.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko isaga.
This is you.	Tani waa adiga.
I asked him what he thought he was doing.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu u maleeyay in uu samaynayo.
I can't believe it	Ma rumaysan karo
But there is not much.	Laakiin wax aad u badan ma jiraan.
I will not do that	Anigu taas ku samayn maayo
Everyone was ready to leave immediately.	Qof kastaa wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu si degdeg ah u baxo.
Very good, very.	Aad u fiican, aad u.
I don't see why.	Ma arko sababta.
Maybe he was right.	Malaha run buu sheegay.
Nothing.	Ma jiro wax.
Here it is.	Waa kan hadda.
He has not been here for a long time.	Ma uusan joogin halkan muddo dheer.
But there is more to it than that.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan taas.
I have never even seen it	Weligay xitaa ma arag
I want to do great things	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax weyn
I should not have said anything	Ma ahayn inaan wax sheego
I still have a hard time	Weli waqti adag ayaan ku hayaa
I knew what you were doing	Waan ogaa waxaad samaynayso
I need to know how to do it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida loo sameeyo
I can do something for you	wax baan kuu qaban karaa
All is well now.	Dhammaan waa wanaagsan yihiin hadda.
I do not feel well	Ma dareemayo fiicnaan
I just didn’t have time.	Kaliya ma helin waqti.
There was so much.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Malaha taasi waa sidaas oo kale.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
She did it for me.	Way ii samaysay.
She was very similar to me.	Aad bay ila mid ahayd.
You are very interesting to me.	Waad ii xiiso badan tahay.
What is amazing is how good it is	Waxa la yaab leh waa sida ay u wanaagsan tahay
Busy, busy, busy.	Mashquul, mashquul, mashquul.
I have heard it before	Hore ayaan u maqlay
I really enjoyed it there	Aad ayaan uga helay halkaas
I saw something strange	Waxaan arkay wax yaab leh
I did not stop	Maan joojin
I would always see him.	Had iyo jeer waan arki lahaa isaga.
Whether she wants to or not.	Haddii ay rabto iyo in kale.
I did not know that you would be here soon	Maan ogayn inaad si degdeg ah halkan u iman doonto
That was for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la hubo.
I did not see you coming	ima arag adiga oo soo socda
Just money.	Kaliya lacag.
Now he could not believe it.	Hadda wuu rumaysan waayay.
I was not present	Maan joogin
It was really awful.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
He was in it.	Wuu ku jiray.
I have to leave here	Waa inaan halkan ka baxo
Has it ever been.	Miyuu ahaan jiray.
Nothing good will come of it.	Wax wanaagsan kama iman doonaan taas.
It's not fun.	Ma aha wax xiiso leh.
I couldn't help it.	Waan caawin waayay.
Only the best.	Kaliya ugu fiican.
It is very good to tell the truth.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay in run la sheego.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
Truly a happy man	Runtii nin faraxsan
Definitely enough, that is what happened to me.	Hubaal ku filan, taasi waa waxa aniga igu dhacay.
Not everywhere.	Meel kasta ma aha.
Maybe this will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
I wanted to talk	Waxaan rabay inaan hadlo
He is very happy with this.	Aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay tan.
I wonder if it will always be	Waxaan la yaabay inay had iyo jeer noqon doonto
I want to get there first	Waxaan rabaa inaan marka hore halkaas ka helo
I have a lot.	Wax badan baan hayaa.
He must have something to see.	Waa inuu haysto wax uu arko.
I want everything for you	Wax walba waan ku rabaa
I wanted to stay for a while	Waxaan rabay inaan xoogaa joogo
It's amazing.	Waa mid yaab leh.
I had to tell her	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego
I need the job	Waxaan u baahanahay shaqada
He did not do that.	Taas ma uu samayn.
He just did.	Kaliya wuu sameeyay.
You are right.	Waxaad tahay mid sax ah.
It is true, as you will see clearly.	Waa run, sida aad si fiican u arki doonto.
I thought it was really good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii fiican tahay
No one said anything to me.	Qofna waxba ima odhan.
It was the same and the same.	Waxay ahayd mid isku mid ah oo isku mid ah.
I saw this as an opportunity	Tan waxaan u arkay fursad
I was even good to him	Xitaa waan u fiicnaan jiray isaga
I had many friends	Waxaan lahaa saaxiibo badan
I will get it.	Waan heli doonaa.
After a while, he came back	Wax yar ka dib, wuu soo noqday
This may not always be the case.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan mar walba sidaas ahayn.
This is why it is not.	Waa tan sababta aysan u ahayn.
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd mid cad.
Let's do this.	Aan samayno tan.
I wanted a little, but not too much.	Waxaan rabay wax yar, laakiin aad uma yara.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani run maaha.
He may tell someone.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu qof u sheego.
I think we can get a chance	Waxaan filayaa in aan fursad heli karno
I have no idea what happened to him	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay
They should not do so.	Waa inaysan sidaas samayn.
I did not stop.	Maan joojin.
I will always be there	Had iyo jeer hore ayaan ahaan doonaa
Very good time.	Waqti aad u wanaagsan.
There is nothing more.	Ma jiraan wax ka badan.
It is very difficult to do.	Aad bay u adag tahay in la sameeyo.
You can only get one.	Mid kaliya ayaad heli kartaa.
He said to himself.	Wuxuu is yidhi.
I heard he is really beautiful	Waxaan maqlay inuu runtii qurux badan yahay
He refused and was imprisoned.	Wuu diiday oo xabsiga la dhigay.
He is clearly great.	Si cad ayuu u weyn yahay.
It was something everyone could do.	Waxay ahayd wax qof walba samayn karo.
I was early.	Waxaan ahaa goor hore.
I do not work like that.	Anigu sidaas uma shaqeeyo.
You can not	Ma kartaa
It will be near.	Way dhawaan doontaa.
I don't want that	Taas cidna uma rabo
You would be fine.	Waad ku fiicnaan lahayd.
Maybe I should go	Malaha waa inaan aado
I was someone else	Waxaan ahaa qof kale
You have done well.	Wax fiican ayaad samaysay.
You will see that soon.	Waxaad arki doontaa taas mar dhow.
She will probably find you.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ku heli doonto.
I had an exciting time	Waxaan lahaa waqti xiiso leh
Something to do.	Wax ay tahay in la sameeyo.
But not yet.	Laakiin ilaa hadda maaha.
And not so well, either.	Oo aan si fiican, sidoo kale.
I want to do something good	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax wanaagsan
I could not guess why	Waxaan u malayn waayay sababta
And the rest.	Iyo inta kale.
He came out and went in.	Wuu soo baxay oo galay.
I will give it to you	waan ku siin doonaa
Maybe this could go somewhere.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay aadi karto meel.
Something to do.	Wax la sameeyo.
I know you can do better	Waan ogahay inaad si ka wanaagsan wax u qaban karto
One came out.	Mid baa soo baxay.
I tried to tell him	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u sheego
We will make time.	Waqti ayaan sameyn doonaa.
He is happy.	Waa uu ku faraxsan yahay.
He came in and looked at me.	Wuu i soo galay oo i eegay.
It will give you something she knows you definitely want.	Waxay ku siin doontaa wax ay ogtahay inaad hubaal rabto.
I do not know why he is here	Ma garanayo sababta uu halkan u joogo
From home.	Guriga ka yimid.
It will not return.	Dib uma soo noqon doonto.
He can do a lot.	Wax badan ayuu qaban karaa.
She told him he was more likely to go home	Waxay u sheegtay inuu u badan yahay inuu guriga aado
There is none.	Ma jiro.
I still couldn't see anything	Weli waxba maan arki karin
He’s having a hard time, too.	Wuxuu ku jiraa waqti adag, sidoo kale.
He looked at me.	I eegay.
Who he was.	Kii uu ahaan jiray.
I wanted to tell you that for a while now.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas kuu sheego in muddo ah hadda.
He is a good friend	Waa saaxiib fiican
She lost.	Way wayday.
I was told.	Waa la ii sheegay.
Probably true.	Malaha waa run.
I felt what we did not say	Waxaan dareemay waxa aanu odhan
Money friend.	Lacag saaxiib.
Something was going to happen.	Wax ayaa dhici lahaa.
I don't seem to get it	Uma eka inaan helo
Very few things really need to be done.	Waxyaabo aad u yar ayaa dhab ahaantii u baahan in la sameeyo.
I looked at him	Waan eegay isaga
I wondered who did that	Waxaan la yaabay yaa sidaas sameeyay
This will be done.	Tani waa la samayn doonaa.
That was hard enough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag oo ku filan.
I have not been one for a while.	In muddo ah maan mid noqon.
I wanted to see	Waxaan rabay inaan arko
I say you are too big	Waxaan leeyahay aad baad u weyn tahay
There was nothing.	Ma jirin wax jira.
I could not believe what he was doing	Waan rumaysan waayay wuxuu sameeyay
Someone you need to know.	Qof aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
I hope they are happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay faraxsan yihiin.
Maybe she does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sameyso.
They did not know that.	Taas ma ay ogayn.
Not a little, really.	Ma aha wax yar, dhab ahaantii.
He is not just a man.	Ma aha nin kaliya.
But one time is enough.	Laakiin hal mar ayaa ku filan.
Making a good time so far.	Samaynta waqti fiican ilaa hadda.
I'm sure you do not like it	Waxaan hubaa inaadan jeclayn
I am something but still good.	Waxaan ahay wax laakiin weli wanaagsan.
I would be one.	Waxaan noqon lahaa mid ka mid ah.
I don't know if that's a problem.	Ma garanayo inay taasi dhibaato tahay.
I think he is now	Waxaan filayaa inuu hadda joogo
I want more than anything	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan wax kasta
That would be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u fiican.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan ayaa dhacay.
I would tell that	Taas ayaan ii sheegi lahaa
It's just, like.	Waa kaliya, sida.
He was still.	Weli wuu ahaa.
I wanted nothing more	Wax kale ma rabin
I no longer want to leave	Mar dambe ma doonayo inaan iska tago
I did not know he was there	Maan ogayn inuu meesha joogo
But me.	Laakiin aniga.
Maybe there is no food today.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay maanta wax cunto ah.
What he does, they do.	Waxa uu sameeyo, way sameeyaan.
Everything right had to be done	Wax kasta oo sax ah waxay ahayd in la sameeyo
I was really surprised she was still with me	Runtii waan la yaabay inay wali ila joogto
I love being with her	Waan jeclahay inaan la joogo
A friend of a friend	Saaxiib saaxiib
There was something after all.	Waxaa jiray wax ka dib oo dhan.
I need to know where you want to go	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado meesha aad rabto inaad aado
How good is that ?.	Sidee u fiican taas?.
I really did not think so	Runtii uma malaynayn
I should have known	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado
I would not say	Ma aan odhan lahaa
I think that's it.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay.
It should have been done with us before.	Waxay ahayd in nala sameeyo mar hore.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I really thought it was you	Runtii waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga
I think it is very good	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u wanaagsan tahay
He knew he had no chance.	Wuu ogaa in aanu fursad u haysan.
I want to be with him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la joogo
Something happened to her.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
That will be very difficult.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
There are other things that need to be done.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo loo baahan yahay in taas la sameeyo.
I got a chance and tried something new today	Waxaan helay fursad oo maanta wax cusub isku dayay
You are like him.	Waxaad la mid tahay isaga.
I did the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan ku sameeyay.
I knew you would get it	Waan ogaa inaad heli doonto
I should have picked it up earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore soo qaado
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
I know everything	Wax walba waan ogahay
Don't do it again.	Mar kale ha samayn.
Please do not discuss this.	Fadlan ha ka hadlin arrintan.
she thinks.	waxay u malaynaysaa.
I think not.	Waxaan u malayn ma.
Probably not sure.	Malaha ma hubo.
Much longer, really	Wax badan ka dheer, runtii
I wish there was someone else	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu jiro qof kale
I know what it was now	Waan ogahay waxa ay hadda ahayd
I know he came to talk to me	Waan ogahay inuu ii yimid inuu ila hadlo
I don't think it is.	U malayn maayo inay tahay.
I found nothing for you.	waxba kuu ma helin.
She said he was at home.	Waxay sheegtay inuu joogo guriga.
This is a difficult place.	Tani waa meel adag.
That sounds very good.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
I was in a difficult time	Waxaan ku jiray waqti adag
I just know he did	Kaliya waan ogahay inuu sameeyay
So, a lot to do.	Marka, wax badan oo la sameeyo.
I know.	waan garanayaa.
I tried	waan isku dayay
I want everything now	Waxaan rabaa wax walba hadda
Really, I really did	Runtii, runtii waan sameeyay
I wonder what came out of it.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ka soo baxay.
Which they did not.	Taas oo aanay samayn.
I love working	Waxaan jeclahay inaan shaqeeyo
They made no money.	Lacag kuma ay samayn.
I think it was for me too	Waxaan filayaa inay sidoo kale aniga ii ahayd
I said nothing about this.	Waxba kama odhan arrintan.
I am not doing this.	Anigu ma samaynayo tan.
I will never say.	Weligay ma sheegi doono.
I'm obviously happy about that	Sida iska cad waan ku faraxsanahay taas
He looked at me seriously.	Si dhab ah ayuu ii eegay.
I don’t feel anything bigger.	Ma dareemayo wax ka weyn.
No one was present	Qofna lama joogin
He was very impressed.	Aad buu ula dhacay.
I refuse to do that, even now	Waan diiday inaan taas sameeyo, xitaa hadda
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
It will take a very long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
I have not been there yet, but recently	Weli halkaas ma aan tagin, laakiin dhawaan
Both are incorrect.	Labaduba sax maaha.
It is not available.	Waa lama hayo.
No other problems were reported.	Dhibaato kale lama soo sheegin.
I did not want to say anything	Ma rabin inaan wax sheego
I do not understand that	Ma fahmin taas
Maybe I already had	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hore u lahaa
I want to talk to you again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale la hadlo
If it is bigger than this, all is well.	Haddii ay ka weyn tahay tan, dhammaan way wanaagsan tahay.
You should too.	Waa inaad sidoo kale.
Please.	Fadlan.
It's hard for me.	Way igu adag tahay.
She doesn't have to.	Ma aha inay u baahan tahay.
I should not have told anyone that	Ma ahayn inaan qof taas ii sheego
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
I will go again	Mar kale ayaan tagi doonaa
I look forward to working with you soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan kula shaqeeyo
I did not get a chance	Fursad maan helin
That is hard for me to do	Taas way igu adag tahay inaan sameeyo
Obviously this is not the case.	Sida iska cad tani sidaas maaha.
I do not understand why	Ma fahmin sababta
I just don’t want to do it.	Kaliya ma doonayo inaan sameeyo.
We are good friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo fiican.
Good day!.	Maalin wanaagsan!.
Not sure yet.	Weli ma hubo weli.
I got, like, three of them here	Waxaan helay, sida, saddex ka mid ah halkan
I know he knows	Waan ogahay inuu garanayo
I will get better	Waan sii fiicnaan doonaa
As you can see, it really is.	Sida aad arki karto, runtii waa.
He was already here.	Goor hore ayuu halkan joogay.
Would you please help me with this?	Fadlan ma iga caawin kartaa arrintan?.
Not sure if this is how it is done.	Ma hubo in tani ay tahay sida la sameeyo.
I got this to work so far	Waxaan taas ku helay inaan shaqeeyo ilaa hadda
Quick	Degdeg ah
I wanted to be a person.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo qof.
I promised to do it	Waxaan u ballan qaaday in la sameeyo
I have to know something about it	Waa inaan wax ka ogaado
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
What will it be.	Maxay noqon doontaa.
I did not like the place	Meesha maan jeclayn
And maybe that's right.	Oo malaha waa sax.
I really like the place	Runtii waan jeclahay meesha
This is just what can be expected.	Tani waa waxa la filan karo oo kaliya.
I need to tell people	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan dadka u sheego
The only thing he found was true.	Waxa kaliya ee uu helay waa run.
I think, really, that was the right thing to do.	Waxaan u maleynayaa, dhab ahaantii, taasi waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
I love being with you	Waan jeclahay inaan kula joogo
I think you have.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad leedahay.
I'm just happy to see you here	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko halkan
Very little of that	Mid aad u yar oo taas ah
That is not a bad thing.	Taasi maaha wax xun.
Me and you, for sure.	Aniga iyo adiga, hubaal.
It's the same with you.	Waa la mid adiga.
Tell us what you need.	Noo sheeg waxaad u baahan tahay.
It was not work time.	Ma ahayn wakhti shaqo.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
But you can see him.	Laakiin waad arki kartaa isaga.
You can do it.	Waad sameyn kartaa.
I need to talk to him before he leaves.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo ka hor inta uusan tagin.
I hope this can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto.
But it was a lot of fun to do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax aad u xiiso badan in la sameeyo.
I know what it is	Waan garanayaa waxay tahay
Not just what to do but how to do it.	Ma aha oo kaliya waxa la sameeyo laakiin sida loo sameeyo.
I need something new	Waxaan u baahanahay wax cusub
I love you so much too	Aad ayaan kuu jeclahay sidoo kale
Very good indeed.	Runtii aad u wanaagsan ayaa la sameeyay.
It could be something else.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kale.
I can't believe it's really me	Ma rumaysan karo inay dhab ahaantii aniga tahay
I think it was almost time	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ahayd wakhti ku dhow
I just want to go home now	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado hadda
I haven't seen anything, I haven't seen anything yet	Waxba ma arag, weli waxba ma arag
There are three of us.	Waxaa jira saddex naga mid ah.
This is something else.	Tani waa wax kale.
I didn't even want to.	Xitaa ma rabin.
I'm sorry you missed it.	Waan ka xumahay inaad wayday.
And let me go back.	Oo aan dib ugu noqdo.
I knew she needed me	Waan ogaa inay ii baahan tahay
I decided on the latter.	Waxaan go'aansaday kan dambe.
He was really a great man.	Runtii nin weyn buu ahaa.
It's the worst.	Waa tan ugu xun.
I'm so scared you won't like me later	Aad baan uga baqayaa inaad i jeclayn ka dib
I do not know him	Ma garanayo isaga
I did not want to stay longer	Ma rabin in aan sii joogo wax badan
He was like me.	Aniga oo kale ayuu ahaa.
I was surprised he would even talk to me	Waxaan la yaabay inuu xitaa ila hadli doono
If you lie I know	Haddii aad been sheegto waan garanayaa
I think she needs it	Waxaan filayaa inay u baahan tahay
I think he has been there a long time	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu halkaas joogay muddo dheer
I really didn't go.	Dhab ahaantii ma tagin.
I wanted to have it all the time	Waxaan rabay inaan haysto mar walba
He didn't even know it existed.	Xitaa ma uu ogayn inuu jiro.
I have known this very well since it was at home	Aad ayaan taas u ogaa tan iyo markii ay taasi guriga ahayd
I did not want that, but it was as it was.	Maan rabin taas, laakiin waa sidii ay ahayd.
That could be what is happening here.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa waxa halkan ka socda.
I just want to know	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku ogaado
Here is another one.	Waa kan mid kale.
I had to say	Waxay ahayd inaan sheego
I knew it would be great	Waan ogaa inay wax weyn noqon doonto
There is more, everyone.	Waxaa jira wax ka badan, qof walba.
It does not come.	Ma yimaado.
He would see it again.	Mar kale ayuu arki lahaa.
Do not take anything.	Waxba ha qaadan.
It is beautiful.	Waa qurux badan yahay.
She is still fine now.	Weli way fiican tahay hadda.
Very good money.	Lacag aad u wanaagsan.
Like no one knows.	Sidii qofna ma garanayo.
But it can't be.	Laakiin ma noqon karto.
He gave it to you.	Wuu ku siiyay.
He can handle anything.	Wuxuu wax ka qaban karaa wax kasta.
I thought we could help each other	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan is caawin karno
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
I came back here and took it	Halkan ayaan ku soo noqday oo qaatay
As a person.	Sida qof.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
I am not one of them.	Anigu ka mid ma ihi.
I wish you did not say so	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaadan sidaas odhan
Now tell me what's going on.	Hadda ii sheeg maxaa jira.
I knew you didn't want me	Waan ogaa inaadan i rabin
In fact, they may not know it.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan garanayn.
New, great opportunity	Fursad cusub, oo weyn
No problem, he will come.	Dhib malaha, wuu iman doonaa.
I did not know where to go.	Meel aan aado maan garanayn.
It is not mentioned, in fact, anywhere.	Lama sheegin, dhab ahaantii, meel kasta.
That was very interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Only really, they are.	Kaliya runtii, way yihiin.
As everyone does.	Sida qof walba sameeyo.
I asked him what he was doing.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu samaynayo.
This is just a small problem.	Tani waa dhib yar oo kaliya.
Today, this may not be so true.	Maanta, tani run badan kama noqon karto.
I don’t think he would like it.	Uma maleynayo inuu jeclaan lahaa.
I will not see him again	Mar dambe ma arki doono
I was surprised he would say something	Waxaan la yaabay inuu wax odhan lahaa
I decided not to lie	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan been sheegin
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan lahayd inay ahayd.
Often this is not difficult.	Inta badan taasi dhib badan ma aha.
I haven't been here for a while.	In muddo ah halkan maan joogin.
It seems to me, too.	Waxay ila tahay aniga, sidoo kale.
Beautiful.	Qurux badan.
Recently, in fact.	Dhawaan, dhab ahaantii.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
I should have known that was not the case	Waxay ahayd in aan ogaado in aanay taasi ahayn
I need something else	Wax kale ayaan u baahanahay
But she loves me.	Laakiin way i jeceshahay.
I would come home.	Waxaan iman lahaa guriga.
I know we will be caught	Waan ogahay in nala qaban doono
Not at the same time.	Ma aha waqti isku mid ah.
But it will not happen again.	Laakiin mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
I am a bad person	Waxaan ahay mid xun
I think you said enough	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax kugu filan sheegtay
I really had a good time	Runtii waqti fiican ayaan helay
Nothing is going on.	Wax socda ma jiraan.
He can talk.	Wuu hadli karaa.
Someone else did it	Qof kale ayaa sidaas sameeyay
I have	waan hayaa
I just want to be there for you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas kuu joogo
tell me how you can do it.	ii sheeg sida aad u samayn karto.
But then that really fun !.	Laakiin ka dib taas runtii xiiso leh!.
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
I didn't have to eat much	Ma ahayn inaan wax badan cuno
I tried many other things	Waxaan isku dayay waxyaabo kale oo badan
I hope you know what you are doing now	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ogtahay waxaad hadda samaysay
He would not make any money.	Wax lacag ah ma uu samayn lahaa.
I need to go there and talk to them.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas tago oo aan la hadlo.
I want him to continue talking.	Waxaan rabaa inuu sii hadlo.
I wanted to tell him	Waxaan rabay inaan u sheego
I want more than to be him	Waxaan rabaa wax ka badan inaan isaga noqdo
It is real.	Waa wax dhab ah.
I wonder if he is good	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii uu fiican yahay
It must have been very close.	Waa inay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
This is only once.	Tani waa hal mar oo kaliya.
It is a good day.	Waa maalin wanaagsan.
Maybe they are even better, really good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xitaa wanaagsan yihiin, run ahaantii wanaagsan yihiin.
But there it is the same.	Laakiin halkaas waa isku mid.
I am very, very happy.	Aad iyo aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I very much doubt we are the same, less so	Waxaan aad uga shakisanahay inaan isku mid nahay, mid yar
I really liked him	Aad iyo aad baan uga helay isaga
I think that is a good thing	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ay tahay mid wanaagsan
I tried and tried	Waan isku dayay oo isku dayay
But there is nothing else to do.	Laakiin ma jirto wax kale oo la sameeyo.
I think it will always be	Waxaan filayaa inay had iyo jeer noqon doonto
I will give that.	taas ayaan siin doonaa.
But tomorrow will be even harder.	Laakiin berrito ayaa ka sii adag.
This was not the best.	Tani ma ahayn sida ugu fiican.
I really found this to be true	Runtii waxaan u arkay in tani run tahay
I will stay with you for a while	Muddo ayaan kula joogi doonaa
So it was with everyone.	Sidaas oo kale ayuu ahaa qof kasta.
You said it all.	Waad sheegtay oo dhan.
I know it can't be you	Waan ogahay in aysan adiga ahaan karin
I did not understand that	Maan fahmin taas
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I can't find much	Wax badan kama heli karo
What he heard he could not believe.	Waxa uu maqlay waa uu rumaysan waayay.
I would not have had anything better to do than work	Ma haysan lahaa wax ka fiican oo aan sameeyo oo aan shaqada ahayn
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahaan lahayd wax wanaagsan.
I can't do that	Taas waxba kama qaban karo
I have to see that.	Waa inaan taas arko.
I do not want to do that	Ma doonayo inaan taas sameeyo
Definitely not needed.	Hubaal inaadan u baahnayn.
I looked good	Si fiican ayaan u eegay
I have no real problem with this.	Wax dhibaato ah oo dhab ah igama haysto arrintan.
Everything is great.	Wax walba waa weyn.
I really did not want to talk to him now	Runtii ma rabin inaan hadda la hadlo
That’s what you are, too.	Taasi waa waxa aad tahay, sidoo kale.
He said he was not.	Wuxuu sheegay in uusan ahayn.
I told him the truth.	Run baan u sheegay.
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I will never do that.	Weligay taas ma yeeli doono.
You will need to know what you are doing.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad ogaato waxaad samaynayso.
I thought he would definitely leave me	Waxaan mooday inuu hubaal iga tagi doono
I want him to say more.	Waxaan rabaa inuu wax badan sheego.
I got that from a man	Waxaan taas ka helay nin
There was something strange about it.	Wax la yaab leh ayaa ka jiray.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I really can't say otherwise.	Runtii si kale uma sheegi karo.
I could not even find that	Xitaa taas ma aan heli karin
I felt at home with you	Waxaan dareemay inaan guriga kula joogo
I think it will be much better.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad uga sii fiicnaan doonto.
Here I am.	Halkan aniga.
I did as you told me	Waxaan u sameeyay sidii aad ii sheegtay
It was the worst.	Waxay ahayd waxa ugu xun.
I can't do that for him	Anigu sidaas uma yeeli karo isaga
I know you are new to this.	Waan ogahay inaad tan ku cusub tahay.
We will be whatever you need	Waxaan noqon doonaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay
I know how beautiful it is	Waan ogahay sida ay u qurux badan tahay
It can be done anytime, anywhere.	Waxa lagu samayn karaa wakhti kasta meel kasta.
I just could not leave	Kaliya waan ka tagi waayay
I think it was early	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd wakhti hore
I want to know who.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda.
But that is a problem.	Laakiin taasi waa dhibaato.
I didn't want to talk to anyone	Maan rabin inaan qof la hadlo
I think you are here	Waxay ila tahay inaad halkaan joogto
I can get another one	Mid kale ayaan ku heli karaa
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
You are one of us.	Waxaad tahay mid naga mid ah.
I just didn’t mention it	Kaliya uma aan sheegin
Really a great idea.	Runtii fikrad aad u fiican.
I know where to find it	Waan garanayaa meel aan ka helo
He did not tell anyone	Cidna uma sheegin
I have no idea what will happen next	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa iman doona
He told me he did not know.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aanu garanayn.
I hope tomorrow will be a good day	Waxaan filayaa in berri ay noqon doonto maalin wanaagsan
I did not leave this issue.	Maan ka bixin arrintan.
I went unnoticed	Aniga oo aan is ogayn ayaan aaday
I just didn’t know how to get out of it.	Kaliya maan garanayn si aan uga baxo.
I can't let him keep it	Uma ogolaan karo inuu sii haysto
He felt great.	Waxa uu dareemay weyn.
I can talk a lot	Aad baan u hadli karaa
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani sax maaha.
That is another thing she said.	Taasi waa wax kale oo ay tidhi.
He was really a great person.	Runtii wuxuu ahaa qof aad u fiican.
I can do nothing	Anigu waxba ma samayn karo
At any time.	Goor kasta.
I don't mind that	Dhib igama qabo taas
I walked out the door.	Albaabka ayaan ka baxay.
I wonder what he will do about it	Waxa aan la yaabanahay waxa uu ka yeeli doono
We need one they don't get.	Waxaan u baahanahay mid aysan helin.
They must be helped.	Waa in la caawiyo.
It is very interesting.	Aad bay u xiiso badan tahay.
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
It will take some work.	Waxay qaadan doontaa xoogaa shaqo ah.
It has not been done yet	Weli lama samayn
I think we can get it all here	Waxaan filayaa inaan halkan ku wada heli karno
It is like that.	Waa sidii oo kale.
I lost friends.	Waxaan waayay saaxiibo.
And more and more.	Iyo in ka badan iyo in ka badan.
I need you to tell me something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad wax ii sheegto
It 's good for that.	Way fiican tahay taas.
She did a lot of right things as well.	Waxay samaysay waxyaabo badan oo sax ah sidoo kale.
I wonder if he loves me	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii uu i jecel yahay
Really, I'm really sorry	Runtii, aad ayaan uga xumahay
This can be bad.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid xun.
He certainly had time to come up with one.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu wakhti u helay inuu mid la yimaado.
we will see.	waan arki doonaa.
Tell him to be there.	U sheeg inuu halkaas joogo.
''	''
I need someone	Waxaan u baahanahay qof
And just everything.	Oo kaliya wax walba.
I can get it, you know	Waan heli karaa, waad ogtahay
It is difficult to say exactly.	Way adag tahay in si sax ah loo sheego.
I am very happy to have you here today.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay in aan maanta halkan ku haysto.
A man went out.	Nin baa baxay.
I will do this again	Mar kale ayaan tan samayn doonaa
Never seen him.	Waligiis lama arag.
But there was a lot, a lot.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax badan, aad u badan.
And everyone else.	Iyo dadka kale oo dhan.
I may not even be there	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa halkaas joogi doonin
I told him that was a good idea	Waxaan u sheegay inay taasi tahay fikrad wanaagsan
That is what happened here.	Taasi waa waxa halkan ka dhacay.
I want him to see me again, so he can see me better.	Waxaan rabaa inuu mar kale i arko, si uu si fiican ii arko.
I do not want this	Maan rabin tan
I think she is happy.	Waxaan filayaa inay faraxsan tahay.
That surprises me a bit.	Taasi waa iga yara yaab.
It was not right.	Wax sax ah ma ahayn.
I know this is true	Waxaan ogahay inay tani run tahay
It must be something good.	Waa inay wax u wanaagsan tahay.
No one says much interesting.	Qofna ma sheego wax badan oo xiiso leh.
He wanted something.	Wax buu rabay.
They will come again, and again, and again.	Waxay soo noqon doonaan mar kale, iyo mar kale, iyo mar kale.
Only you, and one other person if you like.	Kaliya adiga, iyo hal qof oo kale haddii aad jeceshahay.
I was unable to speak.	Waan awoodi waayay inaan hadlo.
I think you do now	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad hadda sameyso
I really can't say	Runtii ma sheegi karin
I really had a great time today	Runtii waxaan helay waqti aad u fiican maanta
I did not want to do anything with it	Ma rabin in aan wax ku sameeyo
It is very interesting.	Waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inaan sameeyo.
I did something for you	wax baan kuu sameeyay
He certainly felt good.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu dareemay fiicnaan.
It's not pretty here.	Ma qurux badna halkan.
I have done this before.	Tan hore ayaan u sameeyay.
I had to be there.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas joogo.
I am having a good time	Waxaan ku jiraa waqti fiican
I love everything in there	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo halkaas ku jira
They didn’t take enough time together, before.	Ma aysan wada qaadan waqti ku filan, ka hor.
But he wants to be.	Laakiin wuxuu rabaa inuu noqdo.
I do the same thing every day	Waxaan sameeyaa wax la mid ah maalin kasta
I just want that	Kaliya taas ayaan rabaa
Just nice, great, really.	Kaliya fiican, weyn, dhab ahaantii.
I wanted to learn everything from him	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ka barto isaga
I do not think so	Uma maleynayo sidaas
I think that is the best thing for everyone	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ay tahay waxa ugu wanaagsan qof walba
Probably, too.	Waxay u badan tahay, sidoo kale.
He decided not to tell her.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuusan u sheegin.
I know who he is	Waan garanayaa qofka uu yahay
It is still everywhere.	Meel walba wali waa joogaa.
I hope you do tonight.	Waxaan filayaa inaad caawa samaynayso.
But there are some things that need to be said.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo ay tahay in la sheego.
I was not ready to do it again	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan mar kale sameeyo
I knew you would do it	Waan ogaa inaad yeeli doonto
That should not be a surprise.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon wax la yaab leh.
I do not want to	ma rabo
I know what we can do	Waan ogahay wax aan sameyn karno
No one was present for some time.	In muddo ah qofna meesha ma joogin.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal ka hor.
I did not	Anigu ma aan samayn
You can tell me.	Waad ii sheegi kartaa.
He was not alone.	Keligiis ma ahayn.
A lot has started here.	Wax badan ayaa halkan ka bilaabay.
I want to know something about you today	Waxaan rabaa inaan maanta wax kaa ogaado
I didn't even know he was here for a while	Xitaa ma aan ogeyn inuu halkan joogo in muddo ah
I know you love me too	Waan ogahay inaad sidoo kale i jeceshahay
I will not go back and forth	Hore iyo dib ugu noqon maayo
You can find a job here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa shaqo halkan.
He did what he was supposed to do.	Wuxuu sameeyay wixii la rabay inuu sameeyo.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
I had to help.	Waxay ahayd inaan caawiyo.
That's good for now.	Taasi hadda way u fiican tahay.
I should not have told him where to go	Ma ahayn inaan u sheego meel aan aado
He is alone.	Waa keligiis.
Obviously you did not get it.	Sida iska cad ma aadan helin.
I dread the worst.	Waxaan ka baqayaa kan ugu xun.
I wonder who	Waxaan la yaabay waa kuma
I have done this before.	Tan hore ayaan u sameeyay.
He did not tell anyone	Cidna uma sheegin
Never too	Weligay sidoo kale
It is unpopular.	Waa mid aan la jeclayn.
We are so much more now.	Waxaan aad u badan nahay hadda.
Maybe I found someone who knows me	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan helay qof i yaqaan
No more later.	Marka dambe malaha.
Problem, as you probably can tell.	Dhibaato, sida aad u badan tahay inaad sheegi karto.
I think that is for sure	Waxaan filayaa in taasi hubaal tahay
That is just me.	Taasi waa aniga kaliya.
He did not stay there long.	Halkaas wakhti dheer kuma sii joogin.
A little while ago.	Wax yar ka hor.
That is a lot.	Taasi waa wax badan.
But that is what it is	Laakiin waa waxa ay tahay
A new one will emerge	Waa cusub ayaa soo bixi doona
I picked something up	Wax baan soo qaaday
I really felt like I wasn’t there	Runtii waxaan dareemay inaan meesha joogin
I know what you said	Waan ogahay waxaad ku tidhi
This is hard work.	Tani waa shaqo adag.
I am a much older man now.	Waxaan ahay nin aad uga weyn hadda.
This was also a lie	Tani waxay sidoo kale ahayd been
You said so.	Adiga ayaa sidaas sheegtay.
It has been reported.	Waa la soo sheegay.
I will do everything	wax walba waan samayn doonaa
I always knew	Had iyo jeer waan ogaa
I have no idea if he feels that way	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo haddii uu dareemayo sidaas oo kale
But more so now.	Laakiin tan hadda ka sii badan.
Tell us something.	Wax noo sheeg.
As if it really didn't exist.	Sida haddii aysan run ahaantii jirin.
I have a long day today	Waxaan leeyahay maalin dheer maanta
But not for long.	Laakiin ma aha muddo aad u dheer.
He told me not to talk.	Wuxuu igu yidhi ha hadlin.
I was surprised she was doing the same	Waxaan la yaabay inay sidaas oo kale samaynayso
Not bad.	Ma aha wax xun.
I would tell you what comes next long ago	Waxaan kuu sheegi lahaa waxa soo socda waa hore
I had to talk to him	Waxay ahayd inaan wax kala hadlo isaga
He came home.	Wuxuu ka yimid guriga.
It seems to be the same.	Waxay u egtahay inay la mid tahay.
You can't come here.	Halkan ma iman kartid.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
That was more than three years ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd in ka badan saddex sano ka hor.
No one would do that here.	Qofna ma samayn lahaa taas halkan.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
And it was not.	Oo ma ay ahayn.
You can see me.	Waad i arki kartaa.
No one seems to be at home.	Qofna uma eka inuu guriga joogo.
I knew he once did	Waan ogaa in uu mar sameeyay
You will love it.	Waad jeclaan doontaa.
It's a difficult place for you.	Waa meel kugu adag.
Maybe somewhat true of that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xoogaa run ah taas.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
I have tried it before	mar hore ayaan isku dayay
I went to see myself	Waxaan u aaday inaan is arko
I know he still loves me	Waan ogahay inuu weli i jecel yahay
No cars were found.	Wax baabuur ah lama arag.
There, I was a little excited.	Halkaas, waxaan ku faraxsanahay wax yar.
I do not understand them all	Ma wada fahmin
I came back.	Dib baan u soo noqday.
I could not believe it	Waan rumaysan waayay
It will not hurt	Kuma yeeli doono
I thought you wanted to know	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto inaad ogaato
Three other people came out.	Saddex qof oo kale ayaa soo baxay.
I need you to know that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad taas ogaato.
I want it done right.	Waxaan rabaa in si sax ah loo sameeyo.
This is not as good.	Tani ma sida wanaagsan.
Not you and no one else.	Adiga maaha oo cidna maaha.
I heard they are too many	Waxaan maqlay inay aad u badan yihiin
I knew that now	Waan ogaa taas hadda
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
I was	waxaan ahaa
Of course, that is not always true.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi mar walba run maaha.
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
not you.	ma adiga.
There is no such thing.	Wax kale oo la mid ah ma jiro.
You can also see.	Waxaad sidoo kale arki kartaa.
I have nothing else to say	Wax kale oo aan ku leeyahay ma jirto
But no one was there.	Laakiin qofna halkaas kuma jirin.
There is nothing more exciting.	Wax aad u xiiso badan ma jiraan.
But there is something else as well.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira sidoo kale.
I think it is very, very high.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad iyo aad ugu badan tahay.
They will fall for everything.	Waxay ku dhici doonaan wax kasta.
This is here.	Tan wuxuu u joogaa halkan.
They should not be there.	Waa inaysan meesha joogin.
I told him so.	sidaas ayaan u sheegay.
I had to tell her	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego
That is good, very good.	Taasi waa wanaagsan tahay, aad u wanaagsan.
I can't be a happy man.	Ma noqon karo nin faraxsan.
I will not do it, no problem	Maan yeeli doonin, dhib malaha
That would be something.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax.
But something else happened.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa dhacay.
I did.	waan sameeyay.
I think everyone has it so that it may not be	Waxaan filayaa in qof kastaa haysto si aanay taasi u noqon karin
I don't have to tell people	Ma ahan inaan dadka u sheego
I will be here with you	halkaan ayaan kula joogi doonaa
I will talk to him.	waan la hadli doonaa.
I think tomorrow is another day.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay berri tahay maalin kale.
I would not have otherwise.	Si kale uma haysan lahaa.
I will stay for one year	Waxaan joogi doonaa hal sano
There were several.	Waxaa jiray dhowr ka mid ah.
You are very fond of it.	Aad baad u jeceshahay.
He was a man.	Nin buu ahaa.
There were several.	Waxaa jiray dhowr.
I know it's hard	Waan ogahay inay adag tahay
I still haven't seen who did it	Wali maan arag cidda samaysay
I knew he was one of us	Waan ogaa inuu naga mid ahaa
The latter, no problem.	Tan dambe, dhib ma leh.
I'm sure I wanted to.	Waxaan hubaa inaan rabay.
I knew I couldn’t stay longer.	Waxaan ogeyn inaanan sii joogi karin wax badan.
I'll be back.	Dib ayaan ugu soo noqon doonaa.
I could not let him go	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu baxo
No food.	Malaha cunto.
It didn’t go away, but it got better.	Ma aysan tagin, laakiin ka sii fiican.
The only thing I know is that you should not	Waxa kaliya oo aan ogahay waa inaadan
He is not a bad man.	Nin xun maaha.
I do not know why that did not happen.	Ma garanayo sababta ay taasi u dhici wayday.
It may not be available right now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hadda la heli karin.
She certainly did.	Hubaal way samaysay.
I have food and a place for you	Cunto iyo meel baan kuu hayaa
I guess they don't want to do anything to me	Waxaan filayaa in aanay rabin in ay aniga wax igu sameeyaan
Not everyone will say it	Qof walba ku odhan maayo
You know they will.	Waad ogtahay inay sameyn doonaan.
, is correct	, waa sax
Stop everything you are doing.	Jooji wax kasta oo aad samaynayso.
I'm sure there must be a place for you.	Waan hubaa inay tahay inay jirto meel aad ku heli karto.
I took that	Taas ayaan ka qaaday
What he found surprised him.	Waxa uu helay ayaa isaga la yaabay.
I really am not a very good person.	Runtii ma ihi qof aad u fiican.
And maybe one after another.	Iyo malaha mid kale ka dib.
I really hope you will too	Runtii waxaan filayaa inaad yeeli doonto
I did not take any chances	Ma aanan qaadan wax fursad ah
Do not believe it.	Ha rumaysan.
It was something I was hoping for, too.	Waxay ahayd wax aan rajaynayo, sidoo kale.
That was to help.	Taasi waxay ahayd inay caawiso.
I still wanted to be with him.	Weli waxaan rabay inaan la joogo.
No luck.	Nasiib ma leh.
I stayed with him	Waan la sii joogay
I think it is better.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax ka fiican tahay.
What was it.	Maxay ahayd.
This would be bad.	Tani waxay ahaan lahayd mid xun.
I should not have found you	Ma ahayn inaan ku helo
I would do nothing for it.	Waxba waan u qaban lahaa.
That was some time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti ka hor.
We'll get to that later.	Taas dib ayaan ka heli doonaa.
A little bit and everything	Wax yar oo dhan iyo wax kasta
I have come back a lot even now	Aad ayaan u soo noqday xitaa hadda
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
I still very much hope we are.	Waxaan weli aad u rajeynayaa inaan nahay.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
I did not want to talk	Ma rabin inaan hadlo
I knew that one would come	Waan ogaa in mid iman doono
I looked up quickly	Si degdeg ah ayaan u eegay
No one has a problem with that.	Qofna dhib kuma qabo taas.
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
I will definitely spend time with him	Runtii waqti ayaan la qaadan doonaa isaga
I need your help	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad i caawiso
It was not always.	Mar walba ma ahayn.
I will not allow it	Ogolaan maayo
I can't talk about this right now	Tan hadda kama hadli karo
That can definitely do it.	Taasi hubaal way samayn kartaa.
She said he was not here.	Waxay sheegtay inuusan halkan joogin.
But there is no time.	Laakiin waqti ma jiro.
I don't know if it's true.	Ma garanayo inay dhab tahay.
I knew what was going on here	Waan ogaa waxa halkan ka socda
I can't do it anymore	Mar dambe ma samayn karo
I can't do this right now	Tan hadda ma qaban karo
I am very happy here	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay halkan
It does not have to happen.	Ma aha in ay dhici karto.
I think that is not a bad idea.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aysan ahayn fikrad xun.
Always, someone would tell him.	Had iyo jeer, qof ayaa sheegi jiray isaga.
I didn't think it included	Uma malaynayn in ay ku jirto
I had to stay with you	Waxay ahayd inaan kula joogo
At home, everywhere.	Guriga, meel kasta.
I liked him	waan ka helay isaga
Not sure what I need.	Ma hubo waxa aan u baahanahay.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
I knew how it would end	Waan ogaa sida ay ku dhammaan doonto
I can really see why.	Dhab ahaantii waan arki karaa sababta.
I knew she had to be there	Waan ogaa inay tahay inay halkaas joogto
It is indeed a difficult time.	Runtii waa wakhti adag.
Not one man.	Hal nin maaha.
But just what.	Laakiin kaliya waxa.
I also started going to school	Waxaan sidoo kale bilaabay in aan aado dugsiga
I left nothing.	Waxba kama tagin.
I know what they are	Waan ogahay waxay yihiin
I need to talk to him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga
That will not do.	Taasi ma yeeli doonto.
I can do that, he thought	Taas waan samayn karaa, ayuu is yidhi
I really like this one	Aad ayaan u jeclahay kan
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
They had nothing.	Waxba ma ay lahayn.
He looked amazing, too.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid la yaab leh, sidoo kale.
But it was him, all.	Laakiin waxay ahayd isaga, oo dhan.
They will stay.	Way joogi doonaan.
I didn't want to see it.	Ma rabin inaan arko.
I will pick him up	waan soo qaadan doonaa isaga
Maybe one day I will do it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hal maalin sameeyo
I was not able to find out	Maan awoodin inaan ogaado
That was really true.	Runtii taasi run bay ahayd.
I decided to do this	Waxaan go'aansaday in tan la sameeyo
Too much now.	Aad u badan hadda.
But only if it would do something good.	Laakiin kaliya haddii ay wax wanaagsan samayn lahayd.
He may be able to help us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu awoodo inuu na caawiyo.
I don't like good people	Ma jecli dadka wanaagsan
But it also may not be so.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
I am always, always, always	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahay, had iyo jeer, had iyo jeer
I know what's coming	Waan ogahay waxa soo socda
I wondered why she did not stop this	Waxaan la yaabay sababta ay wax u joojin wayday arrintan
I really did not want to talk to him now.	Runtii ma rabin inaan hadda la hadlo.
There is so much to learn.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la barto.
He saw a lot.	Wax badan ayuu arkay.
I will be fine at home.	Waan ku fiicnaan doonaa guriga.
I did not know you would be	Maan ogayn inaad noqon doonto
That is not for me now.	Taasi aniga hadda ma joogo.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
I felt a little bigger	Waxaan dareemay xoogaa ka weyn
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
I want to do it again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale sameeyo
He knew he would never do it.	Wuu ogaa inuusan waligiis yeeli doonin.
And here they may well exist.	Oo halkan waxaa laga yaabaa inay si fiican u jiraan.
They will talk.	Way hadli doonaan.
I was paid.	Lacag baa la i siiyay.
I really know who you are	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa qofka aad tahay
I was surprised, really	Waan la yaabay, run ahaantii
That's what he did.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyay.
But now he was here.	Laakiin hadda wuu joogay halkan.
I really did not know why	Runtii ma garanayn sababta
I didn't like it and I left	Maan jeclayn oo waan baxay
As she found out.	Sidii ay ku ogaatay.
I thought but I wanted to say	Waan mooday laakiin waxaan rabay inaan sheego
That will definitely be interesting to see.	Taasi runtii waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh in la arko.
Let's not talk first.	Aan marka hore hadlin.
I really did it badly	Runtii si xun ayaan u sameeyay
That is bad.	Taasi waa xun.
I might be surprised	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan kula yaabay
That was definitely something new.	Taasi hubaal waxay ahayd wax cusub.
I looked back	Dib baan u eegay
I really did not think of any of this	Runtii uma malaynayn mid tan ka mid ah
That may have been.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay ahayd.
Stop making money.	Jooji lacag samaynta.
And so far, very good.	Oo ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan.
But the other one is interesting.	Laakiin kan kale waa mid xiiso leh.
What is it	Waa maxay
He was a man, after all, a very bad man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin, ka dib, nin aad u xun.
I thought everything would come to me.	Waxaan u maleeyay in wax walba ay ii iman doonaan.
That was a lot of money.	Taasi waxay ahayd lacag aad u badan.
It was his favorite.	Waxay ahayd uu jecel yahay.
I have to know what happened to him	Waa inaan ogaado waxa ku dhacay
I really love you	Runtii aad ayaan kuu jeclahay
he is ready.	diyaar ayuu u yahay.
But there is really nothing else.	Laakiin run ahaantii wax kale ma jiraan.
It was not clear.	Wax cad ma ahayn.
I have not had it for a while	Ma haysto in muddo ah
Great for you.	Kugu weyn.
It will be seen.	Waa la arki doonaa.
That was really true.	Runtii taasi run bay ahayd.
This is actually better than not doing anything.	Tani dhab ahaantii way ka fiican tahay inaadan waxba samayn.
I am the same.	Anigu waxaan ahay isku si.
Good luck.	Nasiib wanaagsan.
Every day was a great day.	Maalin kasta waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
She had.	Waxay lahayd.
I wanted to find something new	Waxaan rabay inaan helo wax cusub
Do not join.	Ha ka mid noqon.
I know the place.	waan garanayaa meesha.
I know that now more than ever	Waan ogahay taas hadda in ka badan sidii hore
But another job.	Laakiin shaqo kale.
I'm sure I will find a lot of interesting things	Waxaan hubaa inaan heli doono waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh
This is beautiful.	Tani waa qurux.
There was only one car.	Hal baabuur baa jiray.
I really liked what it looked like	Aad ayaan uga helay sida ay u egtahay
I did not say anything I found	Maan odhan wax aan helo
I just love you	Kaliya waan ku jeclahay
I will not be able to do that here	Ma awoodi doono inaan taas ka sameeyo halkan
This is great.	Tani waa mid aad u fiican.
I think he already knew	Waxaan filayaa inuu hore u ogaa
Only a few years.	Dhowr sano oo kaliya.
He said he was not.	Wuxuu sheegay in uusan ahayn.
I no longer liked him	Xitaa mar dambe maan jeclayn isaga
Which is not what I want.	Taas oo aan ahayn waxa aan rabo.
Much has been denied.	Wax badan baa loo diiday.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
I just want to see	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko
I think he will take that	Waxaan filayaa inuu taas qaadan doono
This is a good place.	Tani waa meel wanaagsan.
He is not here today	Maanta halkan ma joogo
I wanted to do one for a while.	Waxaan rabay inaan mid sameeyo in muddo ah.
It will tell us in a few years	Dhowr sano ayaa noo sheegi doona
He thought it would probably be better.	Wuxuu mooday inay u badan tahay inay fiicnaan doonto.
Nothing more, less so too.	Wax kale ma jiraan, wax ka yar sidoo kale.
She will not tell me why she is here.	Ma ii sheegi doonto sababta ay halkan u joogto.
I can tell you that for sure	Taas hubaal ayaan kuu sheegi karaa
He said he was busy.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu mashquul yahay.
I went to someone for a reason	Waxaan u tagay qof sababta
I did not understand anything	Waxba ma fahmin
It may not be obvious.	Ma laga yaabaa in si cad loo ogaado.
I was lucky today.	maanta nasiib baan helay.
I can't do it any other way	Si kale uma yeeli karo isaga
It looked beautiful, otherwise.	U muuqday mid qurux badan, haddii kale.
This is what you want.	Tani waa waxa aad rabto.
I had to see it again	Waxay ahayd inaan mar kale arko
Much is guaranteed.	In badan ayaa la hubaa.
I hope it is for you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay adiga kuu leedahay
Tell us why.	Sababta noo sheeg.
It is the best now.	Waa tan ugu fiican hadda.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
He took it seriously.	Waxa uu u qaatay si dhab ah.
It is also unpopular.	Sidoo kale waa mid aan la jeclayn.
I think it could be something	Waxaan filayaa inay wax noqon karto
I just need to talk to him	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga
I told him again.	Mar kale ayaan u sheegay.
I would come there	Waxaan iman lahaa halkaas
After that, nothing.	Taas ka dib, waxba.
I liked it well.	Waan ka helay si fiican.
I liked how she said it	Waxaan ka helay sida ay u tidhi
I don't want you to know that.	Ma rabto inaad taas ogaato.
I really did not know what to do	Run ahaantii ma aan garanayn waxaan sameeyo
I need one, and another and another.	Waxaan u baahanahay mid kale, iyo mid kale iyo mid kale.
I saw what happened	Waxaan arkay waxa dhacay
I will pay for the contents	Waxaan bixin doonaa waxa ku jira
I can do this	Waan samayn karaa tan
If you do.	Haddii aad sameyso.
But not only that.	Laakiin kaliya maaha.
I really enjoyed it all	Runtii waan ka helay dhammaan
I just got a chance.	Kaliya waxaan helay fursad.
I can't see him now.	Hadda ma arki karo isaga.
But he did not speak to me.	Laakiin aniga igama aan hadlin.
I want one near	Waxaan rabaa mid dhow
Maybe it would come out.	Malaha way soo bixi lahayd.
I told her exactly what it was.	Waxaan u sheegay dhab ahaan waxa ay tahay.
Not a good time.	Waqti fiican maaha.
I know you still love me	Waan ogahay inaad weli i jeceshahay
I just don't know what you're saying you know.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxaad leedahay waad ogtahay.
I had this friend.	Waxaan lahaa saaxiib kan.
I hope to see him again soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale arko isaga dhawaan
He would do anything for it.	Wax walba wuu u samayn lahaa.
Often it is more than enough.	Inta badan waa ka badan ku filan.
I did	waan sameeyay
It's a bad time.	Waa wakhti xun.
I need to take it now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda qaado
The rest is hard.	Inta kale waa adag tahay.
I can't see anything else	Wax kale ma arki karo
I knew it was	Waan ogaa inay ahayd
I can really say that	Run ahaantii taas ayaan odhan karaa
I love helping people	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo dadka
I wanted to leave, quickly	Waxaan rabay inaan ka baxo, degdeg
I pretended I didn't know anything	Waxa aan iska dhigay in aanan waxba garanayn
It is still new.	Wali waa cusub.
Otherwise, it may be reversed.	Haddii kale, waxaa laga yaabaa in dib loo noqdo.
There was nothing else.	Wax kale uma jirin.
He was very interesting.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I told him so.	Waxaan u sheegay sidaas.
There are so many new things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo cusub oo dhan.
Obviously, everything comes with it.	Sida iska cad, wax kasta oo la socda.
I wish I had	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto
I think we are.	Waxaan filayaa inaan nahay.
I still want to be with you	Wali waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo
No one saw how it was done.	Qofna ma arag sida loo sameeyay.
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
But, not everything is like that.	Laakiin, wax walba maaha sidaas.
You really do not need to know.	Runtii uma baahnid inaad ogaato.
I was very surprised.	Wax badan ayaan ka yaabay.
I could not stay here.	Halkan ma joogi karin.
I hope you will help us.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad nagu caawin doonto.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
But, there is something else.	Laakiin, wax kale ayaa jira.
I think you know that	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad taas ogtahay
I will not tell you again	Mar dambe kuu sheegi maayo
But this.	Laakiin tani.
I knew that very well	Taas si fiican ayaan u ogaa
I would like to help you	Waxaan jeclahay in aan ku caawiyo
I took it one more time	Waxaan qaaday hal mar oo kale
I think it is good	Waxaan qabaa inay fiican tahay
I know how it is	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay
I need it back.	Waxaan u baahanahay dib.
Can't talk.	Lama hadli karo.
Here's how you can help.	Waa kan sida aad u caawin karto.
I am the only one.	Aniga kaliya ayaa jira.
What could be better.	Maxaa ka wanaagsan.
Here it is, and no one is there.	Waa kan, oo qofna ma jiro.
I was not one of them	Anigu ka mid ma ahayn
I think that is why he was surprised	Waxaan filayaa in taasi tahay sababta uu ula yaabay
I would be here for a while now.	In muddo ah ayaan halkan joogi lahaa hadda.
What he would say he did not know.	Waxa uu odhan lahaa ma uu garanayn.
It was just that.	Waxay ahayd tan kaliya.
He tried to pick it up.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu soo qaado.
To say what he says	Si uu u sheego waxa uu leeyahay
That was one of them.	Taasi waxay ka mid ahayd.
I didn't think it could be better	Uma malaynayn inay taas ka fiicnaan karto
There may be a good chance she is doing it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto fursad wanaagsan oo ay ku sameyso.
The door, the front door.	Albaabka, albaabka hore.
I had to do it	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo
We are a lot of surprises, really.	Waxaan nahay wax badan oo yaab leh, runtii.
I told you the truth	run baan kuu sheegay
It was a very small day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u yar.
He came up with something else.	Wax kale ayuu ka hor yimid.
I put it off	Dib baan u dhigay
There was nothing else to do.	Ma jirin wax kale oo la sameeyo.
I want him right here right now	Waxaan rabaa isaga isla halkan hadda
But it will end.	Laakiin way dhammaan doontaa.
Nothing can be done	Waxba lama samayn karo
There you will find us.	Halkaas ayaad naga heli doontaa.
I know it will happen	Waan ogahay inay dhici doonto
You would love him.	Waad jeclaan lahayd isaga.
I thought he was holding you	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku haysto
Maybe she had.	Malaha way lahayd.
I'm really happy	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
I will not let anyone do it again	Ma ogolaan doono qofna inuu mar kale sameeyo
He had to leave.	Waxay ahayd inuu ka tago.
I knew you could not win	Waan ogaa inaadan guulaysan karin
Now they will come out to him.	Hadda way u soo bixi doonaan isaga.
I am happy anyway.	Waan ku faraxsanahay si kasta.
I looked back	Dib baan u eegay
Everything a man does can be reversed.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyo nin waa laga noqon karaa.
Doing something else.	Samaynta wax kale.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa tan wanaagsan.
That is the hardest thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu adag.
I don't want to talk about it yet.	Ma doonayo inaan ka hadlo weli.
I told him he owed me	Waxaan u sheegay inuu igu leeyahay
I did not want to do that	Maan rabin inaan taas sameeyo
You are not really alone.	Ma aha inaad runtii keligaa ahayd.
That is the best thing we can do.	Taasi waa waxa ugu fiican ee aan sameyn karno.
It was a time problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato waqti.
I know how to do it.	Waan ogahay sida loo sameeyo.
I need to see it up close	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko meel dhow
Enough for me now.	Hadda igu filan.
They need food.	Waxay u baahan yihiin cunto.
I should never have left	Ma ahayn inaan weligay ka bixin
I did not believe it at first	Maan rumaysan marka hore
You must.	Waa inaad.
I love doing things	Waxaan jeclahay in wax la sameeyo
I think that would be great	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd
I do things right	Waxaan wax u sameeyaa si sax ah
I could not do anything wrong to help	Ma sameyn karin wax xun si aan u caawiyo
I know everyone as well.	Waan ogahay sidoo kale qof kasta.
Obviously everyone has something to say.	Sida iska cad in qof kastaa leeyahay wax uu sheego.
I keep it here	Waxaan ku hayaa halkan
Few have actually arrived.	In yar ayaa dhab ahaantii yimid.
I need to do what needs to be done	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo waxa loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo
I did too.	sidoo kale waan sameeyay.
I want you to be here	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan joogto
I did not know it was a lie	Maan ogayn inay been tahay
It is much better than nothing.	Aad bay uga fiican tahay waxba.
But he did not.	Laakiin ma uusan haysan.
I could never tell anyone	Weligay cidna uma sheegi karin isaga
Do you have.	Ma waxaad leedahay.
But he refused to do so	Laakiin wuu diiday inuu sameeyo
I will not do this again	Mar dambe tan ma samayn doono
But someone did.	Laakiin qof baa sameeyay.
I know what is ready for me.	Waan ogahay waxa ii diyaar ah.
I really thought we could do it.	Runtii waxaan u maleeyay inaan sameyn karno.
I only did that once.	Mar kaliya ayaan sameeyay taas.
I know a lot about you	Wax badan baan kaa garanayaa
I thought she wanted better	Waxaan u maleeyay inay si ka wanaagsan u rabto
I have to work	Waa inaan shaqeeyo
I had no idea you were here	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaad halkan joogto
I felt great	Waxaan dareemay wax weyn
I heard what you said	Waxaan maqlay waxaad tidhi
I knew it was very good	Waxaan ogaa in ay aad u wanaagsan tahay
I have not seen anyone	Qofna maan arag
I tried to find an old friend	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo saaxiib hore
Surprise me.	Yaab aniga.
And that you would be.	Iyo in aad noqon lahayd.
Now, not often.	Hadda, maaha inta badan.
I only did it once	Mar kaliya ayaan sameeyay
This is a very bad idea.	Tani waa fikrad aad u xun.
But it will be a whole day before he is here.	Laakiin waxay ahaan doontaa maalin dhan ka hor inta uusan halkan joogin.
If they are not in the same place, there is nothing the same.	Haddii aysan isku meel ahayn, ma jiro wax isku mid ah.
I just tried	Kaliya waan isku dayay
I knew they did not understand	Waan ogaa in aysan fahmin
I can talk about everything.	Wax walba waan ka hadli karaa.
There is nothing new about that.	Ma jiro wax ku cusub taas.
I wonder if this is so	Waxaan la yaabanahay in tani ay tahay sidaas
I took it for granted.	Waxba waan u qaadan jiray.
I bought a car yesterday.	Waxaan shalay iibsaday baabuur.
I don't know for sure.	Ma garanayo hubaal.
Very accurate too.	Aad u sax ah sidoo kale.
Everyone took everything.	Qof kastaa wax walba wuu qaatay.
I couldn’t help it, really	Ma caawin karin, runtii
He is at school.	Dugsiga ayuu joogaa.
It was a lot of the same.	Waxay ahayd wax badan oo isku mid ah.
I knew what was coming.	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda.
Bad and really bad.	Mid xun oo dhab ah.
I do nothing else.	Wax kale ma sameeyo.
I would pay nothing	Waxba waan bixin lahaa
I have no idea how to do it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida uu u sameeyo
I need that now.	Taas hadda waan u baahanahay.
They could do nothing.	Waxba ma ay qaban karin.
I did not understand what had happened.	Maan fahmin waxa dhacay.
I'm really sorry about that now.	Runtii waan ka xumahay taas hadda.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
I think there is a good idea	Waxaan filayaa inay jirto fikrad wanaagsan
But he was ready.	Laakiin diyaar buu ahaa.
I can give you anything you want	Waxaan ku siin karaa wax kasta oo aad rabto
The first is.	Marka hore waa.
But it is good to be with you today.	Laakiin waa wax wanaagsan inaad maanta la joogto.
No one can help now.	Qofna ma caawin karo hadda.
It was really hard.	Runtii dhib bay ahayd.
I will do that.	Waan samayn doonaa taas.
You will see me again.	Waad i arki doontaa mar kale.
I thought it would be	Waxaan u malayn lahaa inay noqon doonto
It's beautiful.	Waa qurux.
I'm just glad I still have a job	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan weli shaqo haysto
I think it's bad.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay xun tahay.
I decided not to say anything	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan waxba ku odhan
I just need to leave for a while	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka baxo in muddo ah
Maybe not too	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale jirin
I still haven't said anything to him	Wali waxba uma sheegin isaga
I wanted to talk to you first	Waxaan rabay inaan marka hore kula hadlo
Someone from here	Qof ka yimid halkan
Good stuff, just great !.	Waxyaabo fiican, kaliya weyn!.
I love you so much	Aad ayaan kuu jeclahay
I can't talk much. 	In badan ma hadli karo. 
That is the main reason.	Taasi waa sababta ugu weyn.
I could not believe it was him	Waan rumaysan waayay inuu isaga yahay
But enough of what it is.	Laakiin ku filan waxa ay tahay.
Probably, even, a lie.	Malaha, xitaa, been.
Certainly not.	Hubaal, ma ay odhan isaga.
For most of us, one will be enough.	Inta badan oo naga mid ah, mid ayaa noqon doona mid ku filan.
They are not in a very beautiful car.	Kuma jiraan baabuur aad u qurux badan.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
I think we can do something about it	Waxaan filayaa in aan wax ka qaban karno
I'm sure he can help you	Waan hubaa inuu ku caawin karo
I really did not know why	Runtii maan garanayn sababta
He came back.	Dib ayuu u soo noqday.
People like him do not even exist.	Dadka isaga oo kale ah xitaa ma aha inay jiraan.
I really wanted to know	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan ogaado
I have a good idea right now	Waxaan hayaa fikrad fiican hadda
I had no money	Wax lacag ah maan haysan
I would not say.	Ma odhan lahaa.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto.
It was work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo.
I saw you, maybe clearly	Waan ku arkay, malaha si cad
It's bad for everyone.	Way u xun tahay qof walba.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
I have tried it several times.	Waxaan isku dayay dhowr jeer.
I found it very, very difficult.	Waxaan u arkay inay aad iyo aad u adag tahay.
I really want you	si xun ayaan kuu rabaa
Good luck to you, good luck to me.	Nasiib adiga, nasiib ii leh.
I have a lot more.	Wax badan oo kale ayaan hayaa.
This she said.	Tani waxay tidhi.
I will not say anything	Waxba uma sheegi doono
I didn't want to see him like that.	Ma aanan rabin in aan arko isaga oo kale.
It's hard for me.	Way igu adag tahay.
Even more so.	Xitaa in ka badan.
Not bad.	Ma aha si xun.
I have no idea what to do	Wax aan sameeyo wax fikrad ah uma hayo
I love what they do.	Waan jeclahay waxay sameeyaan.
I did not speak.	Maan hadlin.
I wish I had one like this	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto mid kan oo kale ah
I got that from him.	Taas ayaan uga helay isaga.
I don't want you.	kuma rabto adiga.
She told him she was busy.	Waxay u sheegtay inay mashquul tahay.
I think everyone knows	Waxaan filayaa in qof kastaa garanayo
He did not want this.	Ma uusan rabin tan.
I had a lot of this	Waxaan lahaa wax badan oo ka mid ah kan
I was lucky	nasiib ayaan lahaa
I should be happy now.	Waa inaan ku faraxsanahay hadda.
I knew this included something	Waxaan ogaa inay tani wax ku jiraan
I know how to find him.	Waan ogahay sida loo helo isaga.
What happened next, happened to me.	Maxaa dhacay ka dib, aniga ayaa igu dhacay.
More will come soon	Wax badan ayaa iman doona dhawaan
He wants to be something.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu wax noqdo.
But that is nothing new.	Laakiin taasi wax cusub maaha.
But it was tough.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid adag.
But it is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Laakiin ilaa hadda lama sheegi karo waxa ay tani noqon karto.
Not sure how I will do this.	Ma hubo sida aan tan u samayn doono.
I did not want to talk to him	Ma rabin inaan la hadlo
I need the same job	Waxaan u baahanahay isla shaqo isku mid ah
I wanted to lie	Waxaan rabay inaan been u sheego
You will stay here.	Halkan ayaad joogi doontaa.
I had time.	Waqti ayaan lahaa.
Also, to see other people happy.	Sidoo kale, in la arko dadka kale oo faraxsan.
No one would do that.	Qofna ma samayn lahaa taas.
There is nothing depressing here.	Ma aha wax niyad ah halkan.
It can be done.	Waa wax laga qaban karaa.
I did not do it today	Maanta maan samayn
He came.	Wuu yimid.
Sorry to do that.	Waan ka xumahay in la sameeyo.
That is not what we do.	Taasi maaha waxa aan samayno.
A little bad.	Wax yar oo xun.
I would do so.	sidaas ayaan yeeli lahaa.
He could not find anything.	Waxba wuu heli waayay.
I have other things to do	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo kale oo aad sameyso
I did not see that coming.	Ma aanan arag in soo socda.
I refused.	waan diiday.
Much gone.	Wax badan tagay.
I also have no idea what to do	Sidoo kale wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxaan sameeyo
You love where you are	Waxaad jeceshahay meesha aad joogto
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
I think that really is	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi run ahaantii tahay
I really did not know.	Runtii maan garanayn.
I would not like much	Wax badan ma jeclaan lahaa
I have a man.	Waxaan leeyahay nin.
Apparently he did.	Sida cad wuu sameeyay.
Let everyone be there.	Qof walba halkaas ha joogo.
That is everything.	Taasi waa wax walba.
And you can not get it.	Oo ma heli kartid.
He should not have known.	Ma ahayn inuu ogaado.
I can't let you do it alone.	Ma ogolaan karo inaad keligaa sameyso.
I did not know what to do	Maan garanayn waxaan sameeyo
They are not.	Ma yihiin.
It was a little early.	Waxay ahayd goor hore oo yar.
And still not so great.	Oo weli ma aha sidaas u weyn.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
I know it can be done	Waxaan ogahay in la samayn karo
It is obvious.	Waa wax iska cad.
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
I saw everything.	Wax walba waan arkay.
He was really one of my favorite people.	Runtii wuxuu ahaa mid ka mid ah dadka aan jeclahay.
I liked him.	Waan ka helay isaga.
I can't make money.	Lacag ma samayn karo.
I did not like it much	In badan maan jeclayn
I know you will not believe me	Waan ogahay inaadan i rumaysan doonin
But there, he was not ready yet.	Laakiin halkaas, weli diyaar uma ahayn.
I do	waan sameeyaa
I you.	Aniga adiga.
I have never seen that before.	Taas hore uma arag.
I will leave tomorrow	berrito waan ka bixi doonaa
For a while.	Muddo yar.
I think you are who you are	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad tahay qofka aad tahay
I will stay the day after tomorrow.	Waxaan joogi doonaa maalin ka dib berri.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
For a while.	In muddo ah.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
I will see you.	waan ku arki doonaa .
He seems to have disappeared.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid la waayay.
I just want everyone to get to know each other	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in qof walba uu is barto
I want it back	dib ayaan rabaa
I think that will require three of us	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi u baahan doonto saddex naga mid ah
There was really nothing to do.	Runtii ma jirin wax la sameeyo.
There was very little time.	Waqti aad u yar baa jiray.
They are all long.	Dhammaan waa dheer yihiin.
Whether they like it or not	Haddii ay jecel yihiin iyo haddii kale
I can't come back now	Hadda dib uma soo noqon karo
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
I did not know how to do it	Maan garanayn sida aan u sameeyo
Everyone.	Qof walba.
I think this is what I will do	Waxaan u maleynayaa waxa aan sameyn doono waa kan
I have no one else	Qof dambe maan haysan
I know it will happen soon	Waan ogahay inay dhawaan dhici doonto
Either way it works.	Si kasta oo uu u shaqeeyo.
You will love this one.	Waad jeclaan doontaa kan.
No one could see me	Qofna ima arki karin
If anyone can help me.	Haddii qofna i caawin karo.
Both are at the same time.	Labaduba waa isku waqti.
I did not understand anything	Waxba maan fahmin
I felt a lot better.	Waxaan dareemay wax badan oo wanaagsan.
She told me.	Waxay igu tidhi.
I can do something for you	Wax baan kuu samayn karaa
First, good.	Marka hore, wanaagsan.
Now everyone has done many other things	Hadda qof kastaa wuxuu sameeyay waxyaabo kale oo badan
I really enjoyed it	Runtii wax badan ayaan ka helay
I did not have long, only a few years	Ma aanan haysan waqti dheer, kaliya dhowr sano
I'm really sorry about that	Runtii waan ka xumahay taas
They do.	Way sameeyaan.
We would be much better off if we did.	Aad baan u fiicnaan lahayn haddii aan samayno.
I want to get to know him better	Waxaan rabaa inaan si wanaagsan u ogaado isaga
I know you know that	Waan ogahay inaad taas ogtahay
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
I often wonder why it even has me	Waxaan inta badan la yaabanahay sababta ay xitaa ii leedahay
I told you before	Mar hore ayaan kuu sheegay
Nothing would leave me again.	Waxba igama tagi lahayn mar dambe.
I need to go to school first	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan aado dugsiga marka hore
But this should come as no surprise.	Laakiin tani waa in aan la yaab lahayn.
Again.	Mar kale.
To talk about something.	In wax laga hadlo.
I don't want to work for someone else.	Ma rabo inaan u shaqeeyo qof kale.
I looked at everything	Wax walba waan eegay
No one was present.	Qofna meesha ma joogin.
No one wants that.	Qofna ma rabo taas.
I could not leave you	Waan kaa tagi waayay
There is nothing else clear.	Wax kale oo cad ma jiro.
We were busy.	Waxaan ahayn mashquul.
I have never been, really	Weligay ma aanan ahayn, run ahaantii
I did not know he was back	Maan ogayn inuu soo noqday
He looks bigger.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid ka weyn.
I will not do that again	Taas mar kale ma samaynayo
He wanted to be the best he could be.	Wuxuu rabay inuu noqdo kan ugu wanaagsan ee uu noqon karo.
I really did not know what to do	Runtii ma garanayn waxaan sameeyo
Same.	La mid ah.
I can help you	Waan ku caawin karaa
I know they will find me	Waan ogahay inay i heli doonaan
He was with me.	Wuu ila joogay.
I just didn't want to say anything	Kaliya ma rabin inaan wax sheego
It is me.	Waa aniga.
Let me help you with that.	Aan kaa caawiyo taas.
I couldn't hurt him.	Ma yeeli karin isaga.
This, too, is non-existent.	Tani, sidoo kale, waa wax aan jirin.
I need to see it again	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan mar kale arko
He knew nothing.	Waxba kama uu ogayn.
No matter how little time you have.	Si kasta oo aad waqti u yar tahay.
I need to know exactly where he is	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan si sax ah u ogaado meesha uu joogo
He will definitely stay there again.	Dhab ahaantii halkaas mar kale ayuu sii joogi doonaa.
I told him what had happened to me	Waxaan u sheegay waxa igu dhacay
I should have told you	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu sheego
That is indeed true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
I can see it so far	Waan arki karaa ilaa hadda
This is not new.	Tani maaha mid cusub.
I can see why you did it	Waan arki karaa sababta aad u samaysay
You will take it by surprise.	Waxaad ka qaadan doontaa yaab.
This is a new problem.	Tani waa dhibaato cusub.
I had to help him.	Waxay ahayd inaan caawiyo isaga.
I would assume that was enough	Waxaan u qaadan lahaa in ay ku filan tahay
I thought he loved you	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku jecel yahay
I did not want to talk	Ma rabin inaan hadlo
He was everywhere.	Meel walba wuu joogay.
I knew that would not happen	Waan ogaa in taasi dhici doonin
I would get nothing	waxba maan heli lahaa
It cannot be stopped.	Lama joojin karo.
I put myself in enough	In ku filan ayaan iska dhigay
I really hope we will be together again a long time ago	Runtii waxaan filayaa inaan mar kale wada joogi doono waqti dheer ka hor
But now, he seems to be a good man.	Laakiin hadda, wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu yahay nin wanaagsan.
I will be everything to you	Wax walba ayaan kuu ahaan doonaa
I think he really loves me	Waxaan filayaa inuu runtii i jecel yahay
That would not do.	Taas ma yeeli lahayn.
He will be close.	Wuxuu noqon doonaa mid u dhow.
I did not know that they contained much	Maan ogayn inay wax badan ku jiraan
Even one real friend.	Xitaa hal saaxiib oo dhab ah.
That is how bad it is.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun tahay.
This is a great day.	Tani waa maalin weyn.
It's the same for me.	Waa isku mid aniga.
That should not be too difficult.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ma awoodo, ma awoodo, ma awoodo.
You were a man older than me.	Waxaad ahayd nin iga weyn.
He must have.	Waa inuu leeyahay.
But no one was there.	Laakiin qofna ma jirin.
I didn't think it was me	Uma malaynayn inay aniga tahay
I make a few tablespoons	Waxaan sameeyaa dhowr qaado
Maybe not.	Ma laga yaabaa .
I tried again	Mar kale ayaan isku dayay
That should not be necessary.	Taasi waa in aan loo baahnayn.
I knew it well	Si fiican ayaan u ogaa
I just knew he was	Kaliya waan ogaa inuu ahaa
I'm glad to have him here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan isaga halkan ku haysto
I came here	halkaan ayaan soo galay
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
It was the best place.	Waxay ahayd meesha ugu fiican.
Tell someone what you are doing.	Qof u sheeg waxaad samaynayso.
She said it would hurt.	Waxay sheegtay inay wax yeeli doonto.
I can't stop	Ma joojin karo
I know what's going on	Waan ogahay waxa la isku hayo
It is now available	Hadda waa la heli karaa
I do not want to do that.	Ma doonayo inaan taas sameeyo.
He is good to be here.	Wuu ku fiican yahay inuu halkan joogo.
This is not correct.	Tani sax uma eka.
He was not leaving now	Hadda ma bixi jirin
I do not even want to lie.	Xitaa ma doonayo inaan been sheego.
They certainly exist.	Waa hubaal inay jiraan.
Really, really beautiful.	Runtii, runtii qurux badan.
I think he was right	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu sax ahaa
I think this is true	Waxaan u malaynayaa in tani run tahay
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay runtii.
Enough, you are.	Ku filan, waad tahay.
I should have known	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado
I will not think so again	Mar dambe ma malayn doono
I could not agree	Ma ogolaan karin
It was a bit overwhelming.	Waxay ahayd xoogaa badan.
They are difficult.	Way adag yihiin.
More trouble.	Dhibaato ka badan.
I just need to get it	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
Maybe he thought he was doing the right thing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu u maleeyay inuu samaynayo wax sax ah.
He is right here, and he really got something out of it.	Waa isla halkan, oo runtii wax buu ka helay.
I thought it was you	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga
I hope it will be better	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiicnaan doonto
For one, he can do less.	Mid ka mid ah, wuxuu ku samayn karaa wax ka yar.
What are they?	Maxay yihiin.
I have never been with anyone for so long	Weligay cidna lama joogin muddo dheer
I really didn't tell you why	Runtii sababta kuu sheegi waayay
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
I can not say what it is	Ma sheegi karo waxay tahay
I did not want to stay home.	Ma rabin inaan guriga joogo.
Mostly him.	Inta badan isaga.
As it can be for anyone.	Sida ay noqon karto qof kasta.
I wonder now what will happen to me	Waxaan la yaabay hadda maxaa igu dhici doona
I know what's coming	Waan ogahay waxa soo socda
I wanted to learn everything here, everything that is available.	Waxaan rabay inaan barto wax kasta oo halkan ku jira, wax walba oo la heli karo.
Maybe it's just me.	Malaha waa aniga oo kaliya.
Anything new.	Wax kasta oo cusub.
I do not know how long you will be here.	Ma garanayo inta aad halkan joogi doonto.
She was ready to tell me everything.	Waxay diyaar u ahayd inay wax walba ii sheegto.
I was surprised by this.	Waan la yaabay arrintan.
I spent a lot of time there	Waqti badan ayaan halkaas kula qaatay
Who said so far so good, but now you alone.	Yaa yidhi ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan, laakiin hadda adiga keligaa.
I can be whoever you want me to be	Waxaan noqon karaa qof kasta oo aad rabto in aan noqdo
I think it was right	Waxaan filayaa in ay sax ahayd
I want to tell you more	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan kuu sheego
I have to see him today	Waa inaan maanta arko isaga
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
I knew what he would do	Waan ogaa waxa uu samayn doono
I wanted to get out of here.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkan ka baxo.
I would love to be here	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaan joogo
I have nothing to say	Wax aan ka sheego ma hayo
It will not do any more	Wax dambe ma yeeli doono
Nothing was said	Waxba lama sheegin
He wants what is best for him.	Waxa u wanaagsan ayuu rabaa.
It can be seen everywhere.	Meel walba waa laga arki karaa.
Maybe he had.	Malaha wuu lahaa.
It really was nothing new.	Runtii ma ahayn wax cusub.
And three other friends.	Iyo saddex saaxiib oo kale.
Now he got it.	Hadda wuu helay.
I knew he had done something he thought was right	Waan ogaa inuu sameeyay wax uu u maleeyay inay sax tahay
I would stay	Waan iska joogi lahaa
I was right all the time.	Waxaan ahaa sax mar kasta.
I would love to see you too.	Aad baan u jeclahay inaan ku arko sidoo kale.
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
There are many friends available.	Waxaa jira saaxiibo badan oo la heli karo.
I love him for wanting to do this for us	Waan ku jeclahay isaga inuu doonayo inuu tan noo sameeyo
I decided to find out.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan ogaado.
I decided more than ever.	Waxaan go'aansaday in ka badan sidii hore.
And eka	Kuma eka
I will probably do that tomorrow	Waxaan u badan tahay inaan taas samayn doono berrito
I felt everything clearly	Wax walba si cad ayaan u dareemay
I do not know yet	Ma garanayo ilaa hadda
I should not have lied	Ma ahayn inaan been sheego
He knew very well.	Aad buu u ogaa.
I really didn't know what to do.	Runtii ma garanayn wax uu sameeyo.
I want to get to know him better	Waxaan rabaa inaan si wanaagsan u barto isaga
He was a great friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib aad u weyn.
I thought he was surprised	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu yaabay
I think that was a good idea	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd fikrad wanaagsan
But no more.	Laakiin mar dambe ma jirto.
I can stay there	Waan joogi karaa halkaas
Now it is me.	Hadda waa aniga.
You are happy that you are doing better now.	Waad ku faraxsan tahay inaad hadda si ka sii fiican samaynayso.
The same goes for everyone else.	Sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale ayaa leh.
I know what I will do tomorrow	Waan ogahay waxa aan samayn doono berri
I would do more.	Wax badan baan samayn lahaa.
I want one for myself	Waxaan rabaa mid ka mid ah aniga
A little bit.	Wax yar oo yar.
I looked back	Dib ayaan u eegay
I wonder who lives there now	Waxaan la yaabanahay cidda ku nool hadda
I knew what she wanted.	Waan ogaa waxay rabto.
I seem to have made some money	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan soo galay xoogaa lacag ah
I did not come	Maan iman
It's awful but that's the way it is.	Waa wax aad u xun laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
Where they live.	Halka ay ku nool yihiin.
I think he got an idea from there	Waxaan filayaa inuu fikrad ka helay halkaas
I love you as much as you love me	Waxaan kuu jeclahay sida aad ii jeceshahay
I should not have done more	Ma ahayn inaan wax ka badan sameeyo
I can't do that	Taas ma samayn karo
No problem.	Dhib maaha.
I have to stay home from time to time	Waa inaan guriga joogo mar mar
I did not want anyone to know what was in it	Ma rabin in qofna ogaado waxa halkan ku jira
This is what I have so far.	Tani waa waxa aan haysto ilaa hadda.
I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay adiga.
He could not do such a thing.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma uu samayn karin.
No one wants to talk.	Qofna ma rabo inuu hadlo.
It was something new and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd wax cusub oo qurux badan.
I need it every day now.	Waxaan u baahanahay maalin kasta hadda.
I want him to get out of here	Waxaan rabaa inuu halkaan ka baxo
He seems to have a hard time with that.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid taas ku adag.
It was really awful	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u xun
Here is the one without it.	Waa kan mid aan lahayn.
There is something terrible.	Waxaa jira wax aad u xun.
He saw that.	Taas wuu arkay.
He was surprised.	Waa la yaabay.
I hope to get out of here, too	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaan ka baxo, sidoo kale
Maybe it will be better.	Malaha way fiicnaan doontaa.
I did not want to do anything else	Ma rabin wax kale oo aan ku sameeyo
Maybe I shouldn’t talk too much	Malaha waa inaanan aad u hadlin
I don't want to do anything with it.	Ma doonayo inaan wax ku sameeyo.
I still do.	Wali waan sameeyaa.
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
He went to break up and do something better.	U aaday si uu u kala tago oo uu sameeyo wax ka sii wanaagsan.
Maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in.
All very interesting.	Dhammaan aad u xiiso badan.
He was unable to do so.	Waa uu awoodi waayay inuu sameeyo.
I spent three years there	Saddex sano ayaan halkaas ku qaatay
This is not really the case.	Run ahaantii tani sidaas maaha.
I heard that house was coming.	Waxaan maqlay in guriga soo socda.
I thought that was a good idea	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi tahay fikrad fiican
I did not know they were there	Maan ogayn inay meesha ku jiraan
I know, but I do not see it	Waan ogahay, laakiin ma arko
It was a small, big job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo yar oo weyn.
I will talk about something else.	Wax kale ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
That will be very much to be expected.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u badan oo la filan karo.
Something bad was going to happen.	Wax xun ayaa dhici lahaa.
I do not understand what happened and why.	Ma fahmin waxa dhacay iyo sababta.
I just want to talk to him	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo isaga
It is very difficult to know what is best.	Aad bay u adag tahay in la ogaado waxa ugu fiican.
You did really well.	Runtii si fiican baad u samaysay.
How can it help me? 	Sidee bay ii caawin kartaa?
I knew he thought something was wrong	Waan ogaa inuu u malaynayo inay wax jiraan
I did not want anyone else to have it	Maan rabin in qof kale haysto
I can't speak correctly.	Si sax ah uma hadli karo.
I really can't stay with him and I can't do much	Runtii isaga lama joogi karo oo wax badan ma qaban karo
I tried to be like everyone else	Waxaan isku dayay inaan noqdo sida dadka kale
For one, the people in it are great.	Mid ka mid ah, dadka ku jira waa weyn yihiin.
I am the only one who says where it is.	Anigu waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee ay sheegto meesha ay tahay.
I could not believe what had just happened	Waxaan rumaysan waayay waxa hadda dhacay
I need to see everything	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax walba arko
One and the other.	Mid iyo mid kale.
Qurux.	Qurux.
No one really talked	Runtii qofna lama hadlin
He disappeared shortly after	Wax yar ka dib waa la waayay
I want to get to know you better	Waxaan rabaa inaan si fiican kuu barto
I wanted to tell him more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan u sheego
I was ready to talk to him again	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan mar kale la hadlo isaga
I just need to talk to you	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
I really need to get a few more	Waxaan runtii u baahanahay inaan helo dhowr kale
This is hard work.	Tani waa shaqo adag.
But not all people do.	Laakiin dadka oo dhan lama samayn.
I can barely see.	Si dhib ah ayaan wax u arki karaa.
That is a great thing, it really is.	Taasi waa wax weyn, runtii waa.
It can't be that bad.	Ma noqon karto mid sidaas u xun.
I do not know how to do it	Ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo
I need to learn more.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan ka barto.
He picked it up.	Wuu soo qaaday.
He is smart.	Waa caqli badan yahay.
He looked back at me.	Dib ayuu ii eegay.
I love being here	Waxaan jeclahay inaan halkaan joogo
I wonder if he still has it.	Waxaan la yaabanahay in uu weli haysto.
Again and again.	Mar kale iyo mar kale.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I could not believe it was true	Ma rumaysan karin inay run tahay
you have not seen.	ma aadan arag.
He is a good person.	Waa qof wanaagsan.
I will definitely pay today	Waxaa hubaal ah inaan maanta bixin doono
I hope to see him tomorrow	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan arko isaga berrito
It can't be done	Lama samayn karo
I'm just happy, really	Kaliya waan faraxsanahay, runtii
He did not want to go	Ma rabin inuu tago
I don't know what else to do.	Ma garanayo wax kale oo aan sameeyo.
I would like to have one	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mid haysto
He really did.	Runtii taas buu galay.
Time will tell.	Waqti ayaa sheegi doona.
I will not have it anymore.	Mar dambe ma haysan doono.
I know, it's not smart	Waan ogahay, ma caqli badna
Who owns us.	Yaa noo leh.
I know what is going on now	Waan ogahay waxa hadda socda
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
What is it! 	Waa maxay!
So far he has not seen it.	Ilaa hadda ma uu arag.
It 's better to get back to work	Waxa fiican in aan shaqada ku soo noqdo
I would love that	Waan jeclaan lahaa taas
I will not stop again	Ma joojin doono mar dambe
Good stuff right there.	Waxyaabo wanaagsan isla halkaas.
I'm really not ready to see it yet	Runtii diyaar uma ahayn inaan arko weli
I need to talk to someone.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof la hadlo.
I could not leave the house.	Waan ka bixi waayay guriga.
He entered.	Wuu galay.
I was there for a long time after everyone else left	Waxaan joogay halkaas wakhti dheer ka dib markii qof kasta oo kale ka tagay
I think that is seen as a great opportunity	Waxaan qabaa in taasi loo arko fursad weyn
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
I am not a bad man.	Ma ihi nin xun.
You can go out for a meal.	Waxaad u bixi kartaa cunto.
I need this to be done today	Waxaan u baahanahay tan maanta la sameeyo
I had no friends	Maan lahayn saaxiib
He should not have been here.	Ma ahayn inuu halkan joogo.
I think that would be surprising	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi yaab lahayd
Bad thing, too.	Wax xun, xitaa.
We are what we do.	Waxaan nahay waxa aan samayno.
I might take that for granted	Waxa laga yaabaa in aan taas kugu qaado
I do not go to school	Anigu ma aado dugsiga
I left	Waan ka baxay
It was a clear day.	Halkaas waxay ahayd maalin cad.
There is nothing more false.	Ma jiraan wax ka been badan.
I want to know what he is doing there	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa uu halkaas ka samaynayo
I would be there for everyone	Waxaan halkaas u joogi lahaa qof walba
I like that it is well done.	Waxaan jeclahay in si fiican loo sameeyay.
I know you are not present.	Waan ogahay in aadan joogin.
You just have to.	Kaliya waa inaad.
I love you more than ever and even more than ever	Waxaan kuu jeclahay sidii hore iyo xitaa si ka badan sidii hore
I still wanted to know more.	Weli waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ogaado.
Anyway, she would say.	Wax kasta, waxay odhan lahayd.
He did not leave.	Ma bixin.
And very smart.	Oo aad u caqli badan.
I want to tell you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kuu sheego.
I think that's what she said	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay waxa ay tidhi
This was a place they were not.	Tani waxay ahayd meel aysan joogin.
That is not the reason.	Taasi maaha sababta.
He looked at me intently.	Aad buu ii eegay.
It's the same job.	Waa isku shaqo.
That 's just fine.	Taasi waa iska fiican tahay.
I am better than that	Aniga ayaa ka fiican taas
But you can do nothing.	Laakiin waxba kama qaban kartid.
It is very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
Even more amazing.	Ka sii yaab badan.
I have to be there tonight.	Waa inaan caawa halkaas joogo.
You know that, but you don't.	Waad ogtahay taas, laakiin maaha.
I could not get out of it for a while.	Waan ka bixi waayay xoogaa taas.
We are, you will see that.	Waxaan nahay, waad arki doontaa taas.
Very, very bad.	Aad iyo aad u xun.
You may be lucky.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad nasiib leedahay.
And there are many similarities.	Oo waxaa jira wax badan oo la mid ah.
I need to know what they are	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxay yihiin
I think they are not ready for me	Waxaan filayaa inaysan diyaar ii ahayn
I was always left out	Had iyo jeer waa la iga tagi jiray
I can only go	Kaliya waan iska bixi karaa
There may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan jirin.
As one really did.	Sida mid runtii la sameeyay.
It was real, really close.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah, dhab ahaan u dhow.
But I'm pretty sure they don't exist.	Laakiin aad baan u hubaa in aanay jirin.
It was a very bad idea	Waxay ahayd fikrad aad u xun
I think it looks beautiful now	Waxaan filayaa inay hadda u egtahay mid qurux badan
But now it was not.	Laakiin hadda ma ay ahayn.
If you are lucky, they will soon be over.	Haddii aad nasiib leedahay, goor dhow way dhammaan doonaan.
I guess he has nothing to say	Waxaan filayaa in aanay jirin wax uu odhan karo
He tried three times.	Saddex jeer ayuu isku dayay.
I will not take a chance	Ma qaadan doono fursad
I will be a good man	Waxaan noqon doonaa nin wanaagsan
I think he doesn't know you very well yet	Waxaan u malaynayaa in aanu si fiican kuu garanayn weli
In fact, there is no money.	Dhab ahaantii, lacag ma jirto.
But otherwise, it will come back to you.	Laakiin haddii kale, way kuu soo noqon doontaa.
I know very little about him	Wax yar ayaan ka garanayaa isaga
I guess, if that is what you want	Waxaan filayaa, haddii taasi ay tahay waxa aad rabto
I will catch you	waan ku qaban doonaa
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I had to do something	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sameeyo
He wants to go.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu tago.
There is nothing you can tell me.	Wax aad ii sheegi kartaa ma jirto.
He had to learn.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax barto.
I couldn't find him, he couldn't find me.	Waan heli waayay, wuu i heli waayay.
It's a lot.	Waa wax badan.
Not great.	Ma aha mid weyn.
Not now, not anymore.	Hadda maaha, mar dambe maaha.
I think he is good	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu u fiican yahay
Again and again.	Mar iyo mar kale.
I did not like him very much	Aad uma aan jeclayn isaga
But he knew.	Laakiin wuu ogaa.
He was really here.	Runtii halkaan buu joogay.
But of course everyone knows that.	Laakiin hubaal qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
I am very skeptical of that.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay taas.
It would allow that to suffice.	Waxay u ogolaan lahayd in taasi ku filan tahay.
I know a great place	Waan ogahay meel aad u fiican
Not so today.	Maanta sidaas maaha.
I should not have done this	Ma ahayn inaan tan samaynayo
I have heard it three times	Saddex jeer ayaan maqlay
I hope you are not	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaadan sidaas ahayn
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
I did not want to be anywhere near	Ma rabin inaan meel u dhow joogo
I will come to you	Waan kuu iman doonaa
That was not a man.	Taasi nin ma ahayn.
Past and present.	Hore iyo hadda.
But still.	Laakiin weli.
It was so small and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yar oo qurux badan.
No matter what you have.	Dhib malaha waxaad leedahay.
I still have a lot of friends there	Weli waxaan halkaas ku leeyahay saaxiibo badan
I need to work together	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka wada shaqeeyo
They are not instant friends.	Ma aha saaxiibo degdeg ah.
I did not stay there very long	Ma aanan sii joogin halkaas muddo aad u dheer
I have a good time with you	waqti fiican ayaan kula leeyahay
Take more time any time you want.	Waqti ka badan qaado wakhti kasta oo aad rabto.
I did not always have it	Mar walba maan haysan
I am so happy to see him.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan arko isaga.
I haven't seen him in a while	In muddo ah ma aan arag isaga
I was ready to go home	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan guriga aado
And you can stay as long as you want.	Oo waxaad joogi kartaa inta aad rabto.
I know what will happen there	Waan ogahay waxa halkaas ka dhici doona
He knows nothing.	Waxba ma yaqaan.
He wanted more.	Wax badan buu rabay.
I have to keep it to myself	Waa inaan ku sii hayaa aniga
There was so much to see.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo la arki karo.
It should not exist.	Waa in aanay jirin.
And please.	Oo fadlan.
But it was a place for me.	Laakiin waxay ii ahayd meel aan joogo.
I did not	Maan samayn
I love everything	Waan jeclahay wax walba
I know enough to do it	Waan ogahay ku filan oo aan sameeyo
I really don't know anything about this.	Runtii waxba kama garanayo arrintan.
A really nice guy.	Nin runtii fiican.
I did not get a chance	Fursad maan helin
I know what it was	Waan ogahay waxa uu ahaa
I want to see everything good in person	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba oo wanaagsan ku arko qofka
I have no idea where he lives	Meel uu ku nool yahay wax fikrad ah uma hayo
You came with it.	Adiga ayaa la yimid.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
I just couldn’t stop	Kaliya waan joojin waayay
I am an adult	Waxaan ahay qof weyn
I have no idea where he is	Meel uu joogo wax fikrad ah uma hayo
You are too small for me.	Aad baad iga yar tahay.
Probably right.	Malaha waa sax.
He started again.	Dib ayuu u bilaabay.
I still can't.	Wali ma awoodo.
I got nothing.	Waxba ma helin.
But apparently someone was at home.	Laakiin sida cad qof baa guriga joogay.
He decided to work.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu shaqeeyo.
No one else could do that	Taas qof kale uma samayn karin
He told me.	Ayuu ii sheegay.
I wonder if this is true	Waxaan la yaabanahay in tani run tahay
It certainly was.	Waa hubaal inay ahayd.
It was always talked about.	Mar walba waa laga hadli jiray.
I can see, clearly	Waan arki karaa, si cad
But that is what you have to do.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
I was not even able to do that	Xitaa ma awoodin inaan taas sameeyo
It’s still a little weird.	Weli waa wax yar oo yaab leh.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
He was a good man.	Nin fiican buu ahaa.
I did not want to talk about it	Maan rabin inaan ka hadlo
That really is something else.	Taasi runtii waa wax kale.
This is bigger.	Tani way ka weyn tahay.
I know she did it for me.	Waan ogahay inay ii samaysay.
I could not see him.	Waan arki waayay isaga.
It certainly was.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu ahaa.
But it can really come to you.	Laakiin runtii wuu kuu iman karaa.
is missing	waa lagu waayay
She had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inay samayso.
I could not stop.	Waan joojin waayay.
It's too early.	Waa hore.
It cannot be true.	Run ma noqon karto.
We will help you as long as you help us.	Waanu ku caawin doonaa inta aad nagu caawiso.
I want to do this while she does	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan sameeyo inta ay sameyso
I have never been in a place like this	Weligay meel sidaas oo kale ah ma aan joogin
That there is nothing else.	In aysan jirin wax kale.
Everything you need !.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay!.
I heard it there.	Halkaas ayaan ku maqlay.
A small fee will be paid	Lacag yar ayaa la bixin doonaa
I can go there every day	Maalin walba waan aadi karaa halkaas
This is absurd.	Tani waa caqli la'aan.
I felt so good	Waxaan dareemay fiicnaan sidaas
I am, after all, the only one	Waxaan ahay, ka dib oo dhan, hal kaliya
Really, really great.	Runtii, runtii aad u weyn.
That's right.	Waa sax.
I just pretended to be there	Kaliya waxaan iska dhigay inaan halkaas joogo
I did this myself	Tan ayaan isku sameeyay
I had to keep you	Waxay ahayd inaan ku haysto
I looked up quickly	Si degdeg ah ayaan u eegay
Few people are better off.	Dadka yar ayaa ka wanaagsan.
I need your help tonight	Caawa ayaan u baahanahay in aad iga caawiso
I found something better to do.	Waxaan helay wax ka fiican oo aan sameeyo.
I did not come to talk to you about the job	Uma iman inaan shaqada kala hadlo
No wonder it took so long.	La yaab ma leh inuu waqti dheer qaatay.
I just want to help people	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo dadka
It is enough that.	Waxaa ku filan in.
Obviously he did not get what he wanted.	Waxa iska cad in aanu helin wixii uu rabay.
I really know it is	Dhab ahaantii waan ogahay inay tahay
I still do this.	Weli tan ayaan sameeyaa.
I have been here for a while now	In muddo ah ayaan hadda joogay
I will always do.	Had iyo jeer waan sameyn doonaa.
Too much.	Aad iyo aad u badan.
I think it looks great	Waxaan filayaa inay u egtahay mid aad u fiican
She told me to give her time.	Waxay igu tidhi waqti ku sii.
We wouldn’t get much.	Wax badan ma heli lahayn.
This was more exciting than she thought.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad uga xiiso badan sidii ay u malayn lahayd.
You can hardly see.	Si dhib ah ayaad wax u arki kartaa.
I knew something was going to happen	Waan ogaa inay wax dhici doonaan
Everyone else is home now.	Qof kasta oo kale hadda waa guriga.
I do everything for myself.	Wax walba waan u sameeyaa aniga.
I know everyone.	Waan ogahay qof walba.
Now he does.	Hadda wuu sameeyay.
he was not ready.	diyaar uma ahayn.
It was often said.	Inta badan waa la sheegi jiray.
I want to talk about that	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo taas
And sometimes.	Iyo mar mar.
He really was.	Runtii wuu ahaa.
I just want to say what he knows	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inuu sheego wuxuu yaqaan
It will stay.	Way joogi doontaa.
I can't get to work.	Ma heli karo in aan shaqeeyo.
Everything.	Wax walba.
He saw things he should not have seen.	Wuxuu arkay waxyaabo uusan ahayn inuu arko.
That is interesting.	Taasi waa mid xiiso leh.
This is a difficult time.	Tani waa waqti adag.
Everything will be new.	Wax walba waxay noqon doonaan cusub.
I know it won't hurt me	Waan ogahay inuusan waxba i yeeli doonin
Everyone knows, but no one looks like you.	Qof kastaa waa yaqaan, laakiin qofna uma eka.
No one can tell this	Qofna uma sheegi karo arrintan
I want to know more about him	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado isaga
I really don't know why.	Runtii ma garanayo sababta.
I guess it won't hurt.	Waxaan filayaa inuusan waxba ka yeeli doonin.
That is the same.	Taasi waa isku mid.
She will do what she has to do.	Waxay sameyn doontaa waxa ay tahay inay sameyso.
That he would do so.	In uu sidaas samayn lahaa.
I started to resist	Waxaan bilaabay inaan ka hor tago
I'm not just talking about money.	Ka hadli maayo lacag kaliya.
I want to be with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo
I will go to him.	waan tagi doonaa isaga.
Not here	Halkan maaha
I really don't care much.	Runtii wax badan igama qabo.
I would have done this earlier	Mar hore ayaan tan samayn lahaa
What you did is right.	Waxaad samaysay waa sax.
I did the same	sidaas oo kale ayaan ku sameeyay
This he picked up.	Tani wuu soo qaaday.
He was not here.	Halkan ma jirin.
That was a difficult time.	Taasi waxay ahayd waqti adag.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
I will let you know that.	Waxaan kuu ogolaan doonaa inaad ogaato taas.
Only this cannot be true.	Kaliya tani run ma noqon karto.
But there are.	Laakiin way jiraan.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
I wanted to say something	Waxaan rabay inaan wax sheego
But now it cannot be helped.	Laakiin hadda lama caawin karo.
Is that nothing? 	Miyaanay taasi waxba ahayn?
I don't see you here.	kuma arko halkan.
It would not stop.	Ma ay joojin lahayn.
I had to be the best	Waxay ahayd inaan noqdo kan ugu fiican
Please tell me what you would like me to do.	Fadlan ii sheeg waxaad jeclaan lahayd inaan sameeyo.
It would be great for him.	Aad bay ugu fiicnaan lahayd isaga.
But it can no longer come out.	Laakiin mar dambe ma soo bixi karto.
I would see things you could not	Waxaan arki lahaa waxyaabo aadan awoodin
It was really great.	Runtii waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan.
I didn't want anything more from you	Wax kale ma rabin inaan isaga kaa helo
If it is less do nothing.	Haddii ay ka yar tahay waxba ha samayn.
It is definitely a great opportunity.	Hubaal waa fursad weyn.
I always do, you know	Mar walba waan sameeyaa, waad ogtahay
I think they will happen, you know	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici doonaan, waad ogtahay
But she could not.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday.
But the living, too.	Laakiin dadka nool, sidoo kale.
I wondered what he wanted	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu rabo
Something similar often.	Wax la mid ah inta badan.
I went home to work on what I was doing	Waxaan aaday guriga si aan uga shaqeeyo waxa aan sameeyo
That could be the same.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sidoo kale.
It was still too early for anyone to be there.	Weli waxay ahayd goor hore oo qofna inuu halkaas joogo.
No one has done it before.	Qofna hore uma samayn.
There was one out.	Waxaa jiray mid baxay.
It should have existed.	Waxay ahayd inay jirto.
A few years older than me	Dhowr sano ayaa iga weyn
I hope all is well	Waxaan rajeynayaa in wax walba ay wanaagsan yihiin
I told someone	Qof baan u sheegay
But there is that.	Laakiin waxaa jira taas.
It was so beautiful and.	Waxay ahayd mid aad qurux badan iyo.
I hope I find something very interesting	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan helo wax aad u xiiso badan
It is you.	Adiga ayaa tahay.
I always have time for you	Mar walba waqti ayaan kuu hayaa
It was really a lucky find.	Runtii waxay ahayd nasiib la helay.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
I did not want to go anywhere else	Ma rabin inaan aado meel kale
I thought a lot.	Waxaan u maleeyay in badan.
I always had	Had iyo jeer waan lahaa
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
That is nothing new to us.	Taasi wax nagu cusub maaha.
He left me.	Wuu iga tagay.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
There was no surprise there.	Ma jirin wax la yaab leh halkaas.
No one did that, either.	Qofna taas ma samayn, sidoo kale.
I still can't see why you want this.	Wali ma arki karo sababta aad tan u rabto.
We are friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
But we do not do that.	Laakiin taas ma samayno.
That was all true.	Taas oo dhan run bay ahayd.
I knew you would be here	Waan ogaa inaad halkaan joogi doonto
I will never lie	Weligay been ma sheegi doono
I think he was into something.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu wax ku jiray.
But it was all done beautifully	Laakiin dhammaan si qurux badan ayaa loo sameeyay
I think they are close	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay isku dhow yihiin
He came here to be real.	Waxa uu halkan u yimid inuu noqdo mid dhab ah.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
What one person needs the other will give.	Waxa uu qof u baahan yahay kan kale ayaa siin doona.
I love him, no matter what he does	Waan jeclahay isaga, si kasta oo uu sameeyay
I'm all there ever was	Waxaan ahay dhammaan waxaa jiray weligay
I did not want to tell him	Maan rabin inaan u sheego
I will not say anything else	Wax kale odhan maayo
It may not have existed yet.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uusan weli ahaan jirin.
I should have done it earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore sameeyo
I did and I still do.	Waan sameeyay oo weli waan sameeyaa.
I will not allow it.	Ma ogolaan doono.
I think we will see.	Waxaan filayaa inaan arki doono.
I happened to be where it was made	Waxaan ka dhacay meesha laga sameeyay
I was surprised	Waan la yaabay
I could not see anyone else, only him	Maan arki karin qof kale, isaga kaliya
I will never be able to tell him what happened, he thought.	Weligay ma awoodi doono inaan u sheego waxa dhacay, ayuu is yidhi.
No wonder, too.	La yaab ma leh, sidoo kale.
She knew she wanted more.	Way ogaatay inay wax badan ka rabto.
Everyone started from the same place.	Qof kastaa wuxuu ka soo bilaabay isku meel.
I know what they really are	Waan ogahay waxa ay dhab ahaantii yihiin
I had to be like him	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga oo kale noqdo
I would like him to speak to me now.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu hadda ii hadlo.
I hope you are well	Waxaan rajeynayaa mid wanaagsan
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
It may not even be the same.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa u badan tahay inay mid tahay.
I didn’t want to do it.	Maan rabin inaan sameeyo.
But she was someone else as well.	Laakiin waxay ahayd qof kale sidoo kale.
You will love him.	Waad jeclaan doontaa isaga.
I knew it was a bad idea	Waan ogaa inay fikrad xun ahayd
He didn't get enough.	Wax ku filan ma uu helin.
Have you had it before?	Hadda ka hor ma lahayd?.
I had something similar	Waxaan lahaa wax la mid ah
I expect that.	taas ayaan filayaa.
I will stay here no matter what	Waan joogi doonaa halkan dhib malaha
He does what he says.	Wuu sameeyaa wuxuu yidhi.
I knew what could be said, and what might not happen	Waan ogaa waxa la odhan karo, iyo waxa laga yaabo in aan dhici doonin
He was a very handsome man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u qurux badan.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
Not as it is now.	Ma aha sida ay hadda tahay.
What to do ?.	Maxaa la sameeyaa?.
I could not allow that	Ma ogolaan karin taas
I like to eat a lot.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax badan cuno.
We can't go there.	Ma bixi karno halkaas.
Yesterday I did not get a chance to buy anything	Shalay maan helin fursad aan wax ku iibsado
No one really did.	Qofna runtii ma samayn.
They really love each other.	Runtii way is jecel yihiin.
When that.	Marka taas.
Not much.	Wax badan ma aha.
I can't say enough	Wax ku filan kama odhan karo
I did not do it again	Mar dambe ma samayn
I tried to talk to him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la hadlo.
It is enough for us.	Waa nagu filan tahay.
I think maybe she is a new person	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo inay tahay qof cusub
I can't stop now.	Hadda ma joojin karo.
I knew he didn't tell me everything	Waan ogaa inuusan wax walba ii sheegin
I love him.	Waan jeclahay isaga.
No one came home.	Qofna guriga ma iman.
Hardly came out of him.	Si dhib ah ayaa uga soo baxay isaga.
What happened can be seen as bad.	Wixii dhacay waxaa loo arki karaa wax xun.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I'm glad you love me.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad i jeceshahay.
I was surprised to see you	Waan la yaabay inaan ku arko
A smart friend with a good idea.	Saaxiib caqli badan oo fikrad wanaagsan leh.
It is always good to know.	Had iyo jeer way wanaagsan tahay in la ogaado.
I think there is everything	Waxaan filayaa inay jiraan wax dhan
I will not do that again	Taas mar dambe ma yeeli doono
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
I know what's coming.	Waan ogahay waxa soo socda.
She will be happy.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid faraxsan.
I love working for you	Waxaan jeclahay in aan kuu shaqeeyo
I didn't want to say anything.	Ma rabin inaan wax sheego.
I still can't believe he did that	Wali ma rumaysan karo inuu sidaas sameeyay
I don't know what happened.	Ma garanayo waxa dhacay.
A few can be found here	Wax yar ayaa halkan laga heli karaa
Most were taken.	Inta badan waa la qaaday.
It was close.	Waxay ahayd mid dhow.
I did what you wanted.	Waxaan sameeyay waxaad rabto.
That is not much.	Taasi ma badna.
There was something they did not like.	Waxaa jiray wax aysan jeclayn.
It was a great time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u fiican.
I just walked out the front door	Kaliya waxaan ka soo baxay albaabka hore
Take it seriously.	Si dhab ah u qaado.
But no problems appeared.	Laakiin ma jirin wax dhibaato ah oo u muuqday.
Please, he said.	Fadlan, ayuu yidhi.
But it is more complicated than that.	Laakiin way ka dhib badan tahay taas.
They did not stop.	Ma ay joojin.
Don't stop anything.	Waxba ha u joojin.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
Much would be true and true.	In badan ayaa run iyo run noqon lahaa.
I will not talk to you again	Mar dambe la hadli maayo
You can stay	Waad joogi kartaa
I did not know what to do	Ma garanayn wuxuu samayn lahaa
I felt at home quickly	Waxaan dareemay inaan guriga joogo si degdeg ah
I really need to go home	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan guriga aado runtii
I had to learn to stay still	Waxay ahayd inaan barto inaan weli joogo
I hope so	Waxaan rajeynayaa
I want to know everything about him	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ka ogaado isaga
I know everything now.	Wax walba waan ogahay hadda.
I can't see how we can help with that	Ma arki karo sida aan taas uga caawin karno
I really did not want to know	Runtii ma rabin inaan ogaado
I heard everything	Wax walba waan maqlay
I'm really sorry about that, you know	Runtii aad ayaan uga xumahay taas, waad ogtahay
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
He was amazing.	Wuxuu ahaa yaab.
I went there and nothing again	Halkaas ayaan aaday oo waxba mar kale
I have no idea what happened.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa dhacay.
I did not understand why he did not come	Maan fahmin sababta uu u iman waayay
I really want to do this	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan tan sameeyo
I will be for you	Aniga ayaa kuu noqon doona
I know he tried to pick me up	Waan ogahay inuu isku dayay inuu i qaado
It is very, very bad.	Aad iyo aad bay u xun tahay.
You have been heard.	Waa lagu maqlay.
But it will be.	Laakiin way noqon doontaa.
Not often.	Maaha inta badan.
They are probably good at that.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ku fiican yihiin taas.
That's really bad, but we can't help it.	Runtii taasi waa wax xun, laakiin ma caawin karno.
I found myself in love with him	Waxaan is arkay aniga oo isaga jecel
If only I had a good one.	Haddii mid wanaagsan heli lahaa.
I can't believe this	Ma rumaysan karo tan
They were not present.	Ma aysan joogin.
There may be more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax badan.
We know he did.	Waanu ogayn inuu sameeyay.
He should not come here.	Waa inuusan halkan iman.
Maybe, he thought.	Malaha, wuu mooday.
That would be true.	Taasi run bay ahaan lahayd.
But he made one promise.	Laakiin hal ballan buu sameeyay.
I hope you can stay here	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad halkaan joogi karto
Just like me.	Si la mid ah aniga.
I know how much you want this	Waan ogahay inta aad tan rabto
I will never do that to you	Weligay sidaas kugu samayn maayo
I have to go a little.	Waa inaan tago wax yar.
I never wanted anyone else	Weligay maan rabin qof kale
I found it here for you	Waan ka helay halkan adiga
I know what happened	Waan ogahay waxa dhacay
I think it is still a little difficult	Waxaan filayaa inay wali dhib yar tahay
But it can be done.	Laakiin waa la samayn karaa.
Suffice it to say.	Wax ku filan baa laga yidhi.
I love him	waan jeclahay isaga
I heard everything	Wax walba waan maqlay
You do not have to be here alone.	Waa inaadan keligaa halkan joogin.
He will believe everything.	Wuu rumaysan doonaa wax kasta.
I thought we were friends	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan nahay saaxiibo
Not true.	Run maaha.
I have to do what is best for me, you know	Waa inaan sameeyaa waxa aniga ii fiican, waad ogtahay
Do not talk to anyone.	Cidna ha la hadlin.
That's how bad it is.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun tahay.
There must be more.	Waa in ay jiraan wax ka badan.
Something very beautiful.	Wax aad u qurux badan.
Everyone does.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
He may tell everyone.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu qof walba u sheego.
I can't do that right now	Taas hadda ma qaban karo
He did not want to leave me.	Ma rabin inuu iga tago.
I wanted more from you	Wax badan ayaan kaa rabay
I wonder if we can do it	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aan sameyn karno
But this is going to be very fast.	Laakiin tani waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u degdeg badan.
I want to see you at work	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko shaqada
But the rest is fine.	Laakiin inta kale waa fiican tahay.
You can't see a bit of a bad place.	Ma arki kartid xoogaa meesha xun.
I will miss you very much.	Waxaan aad u weyn doonaa.
Something terrible happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
I want to do what he wants me to do	Waxaan rabaa in aan sameeyo waxa uu iga rabo
Not only will it take too much time.	Ma aha oo kaliya waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u badan.
I just can't believe it	Kaliya ma rumaysan karo
It looks like a job.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo.
I will stay there for no time	Waxaan joogi doonaa halkaas waqti aan lahayn
I really didn't think it was you	Runtii uma malaynayn inay adiga tahay
I have not done anything to help you before	Wax aan ku caawiyo hore uma samayn
I will not return.	soo noqon maayo.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
But I didn't need much.	Laakiin wax badan uma baahnayn.
I hope you will be fine.	Waxaan filayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto.
I do not want to know if it is good for me or not.	Ma doonayo in aan ogaado in ay aniga ii fiican tahay iyo in kale.
Whatever you want to do you can get it beautifully.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto inaad sameyso waxaad si qurux badan u heli kartaa.
He was robbed.	Wuu la dhacay.
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono
I like to talk to	Waan jeclahay in aan la hadlo
I told her she should not do that	Waxa aan u sheegay in aanay ahayn in ay sidaas samayso
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
I bought one to see how it looks	Waxaan soo iibsaday mid si aan u arko sida ay tahay
He had never seen anyone more beautiful.	Ma uusan arag qof ka qurux badan.
I took it well	si fiican ayaan kuu qaatay
I must not take anything.	Waa in aan waxba u qaadan.
But once it was something else.	Laakiin mar bay ahayd wax kale.
I can't believe he's here	Ma rumaysan karo inuu halkan joogo
I didn't like him.	Maan jeclayn isaga.
I can't come back now	Hadda dib uma soo noqon karo
Really really hard.	Runtii runtii aad u adag.
I think he feels the same way about me	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dareemayo si la mid ah aniga
As far as I can tell.	Inta aan sheegi waayay.
I am not smart	Anigu ma ihi caqli badan
I hope to see you there !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaas kugu arko!.
I will always be there	Had iyo jeer waan joogi doonaa
I do not have time.	Waqti uma hayo.
I always have a good time there.	Mar walba waqti fiican ayaan ku leeyahay halkaas.
He was a well-known man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin la yaqaan.
That was not ready	Taas diyaar uma ahayn
A good place, really.	Meel wanaagsan, dhab ahaantii.
Good job.	Shaqo wanaagsan.
I'm sure now.	Waan hubaa hadda.
If he likes it, he can keep it.	Haddii uu ka helo, wuu haysan karaa.
I didn't think it was real	Uma malaynayn inay dhab tahay
I have something to work on	Waxa aan hayaa wax aan ku shaqeeyo
I never understood that	Weligay taas ma fahmin
Everyone knew who she was.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa cidda ay tahay.
I liked him	Waan ka helay isaga
I don't think he is.	Uma maleynayo inuu yahay.
It is not very interesting	Ma ahan mid aad u xiiso badan
It's too big.	Aad buu u weyn yahay.
That is how it is here.	Taasi waa sida ay halkan tahay.
It was invisible.	Waxay ahayd mid aan la arki karin.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
He was just there.	Kaliya halkaas ayuu joogay.
I had to be with him, as a friend	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga la joogo, saaxiib ahaan
I wanted him to say something	Waxaan rabay inuu wax sheego
I can't stay with you.	Kuma joogi karo adiga.
I want to make a good one here	Waxaan rabaa inaan mid wanaagsan halkan ka sameeyo
There is none.	Ma jiro.
A good and true friend.	Saaxiib wanaagsan oo dhab ah.
I know you have to be very busy.	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad mashquul badan tahay.
I told you it was good	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay fiican tahay
I am the only one	aniga kaliya ayaan ahay
I could not get there soon	Mar dhow ma aan iman karin halkaas
Not recently.	Dhawaan ma aha.
I didn't even have time to talk	Xitaa waqti aan la hadlo maan helin
I think he is fine.	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiican yahay.
It is everywhere.	Waa meel walba.
I need to do something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax sameeyo
A friend of the people.	Saaxiib dadka.
You were a man older than me.	Waxaad ahayd nin iga weyn.
I looked good	Si fiican ayaan u eegay
I got it here.	Halkan ayaan ku helay.
There is a lot going on there.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo halkaas ka jira.
He would give it more time.	Wuxuu siin lahaa waqti badan.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I decided not to say anything	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan waxba odhan
Enough money.	Lacag ku filan.
I have to keep you there.	Waa inaan ku hayaa halkaas.
He really wants to talk to you.	Dhab ahaantii wuxuu rabaa inuu kula hadlo.
Now you can take it if you want.	Hadda waad qaadan kartaa haddii aad rabto.
I heard me say that	Waxaan maqlay aniga oo sidaas leh
I had no idea how to do that	Maan lahayn wax fikrad ah si aan u sameeyo taas
I tried.	Waxaan isku dayay.
Let me keep it.	Aan sii hayo.
I felt that no one liked me	Waxa aan dareemay in qofna i jeclayn
I did that.	Taas ayaan sameeyay.
But he can do it.	Laakiin wuu samayn karaa.
You did it well.	Waxa aad u samaysay si fiican.
She didn't give much.	Wax badan ma aysan siin.
Everyone is great.	Qof walba waa weyn yahay.
It may be harder than before.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii adag sidii hore.
Much is unknown at this time	Wax badan ayaan la garanayn hadda
This is a difficult problem.	Tani waa dhibaato adag.
We can't go back.	Dib uma noqon karno.
There may be a chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto fursad.
I will not stay here another day	Ma sii joogi doono halkan maalin kale
I think so well.	Si fiican ayaan u qabaa.
Three, really.	Saddex, dhab ahaantii.
I did the rest.	Inta kale waan sameeyay.
I can only go	Kaliya waan iska bixi karaa
You can say it will happen.	Waad sheegi kartaa inay dhici doonto.
You said so.	Adiga ayaa sidaas sheegtay.
I think it is not a big idea	Waxaan u malaynayaa in aanay ahayn fikrad badan
It looks like a good time.	Waxay u egtahay waqti fiican.
I thought she would do something else	Waxaan u malayn lahaa inay wax kale samayn lahayd
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay
I did not think we would be found	Uma malaynayn in nala heli doono
I refused to work with you	Waan diiday inaan kula shaqeeyo
I know now there are things like that	Waan ogahay hadda inay jiraan waxyaabo sidaas oo kale ah
Maybe it will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawin doonto.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
It wasn’t me, for sure.	Aniga ma ahayn, hubaal.
There is so much more to us.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo naga badan.
I really hope it will help	Runtii waxaan filayaa inay ku caawin doonto
No one had much money.	Qofna lacag badan ma haysan.
I looked at three of them	Saddex ka mid ah ayaan eegay
She loves me, not you.	Way i jeceshahay, adiga maaha.
I wonder how he feels today	Waxaan la yaabay sida uu maanta dareemayo
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma uu sheegin.
I think you are like me too	Waxaan filayaa in aad aniga ila tahay sidaas oo kale
I want to see	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko
I would like to talk to you for a long time	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan waqti dheer kula hadlo
He really did, he said.	Runtii wuu sameeyay, ayuu yidhi.
I should have known that this is how it will happen	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado in tani ay tahay sida ay u dhici doonto
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
He didn't have much to say.	Wax badan oo uu ku hadlo ma lahayn.
I did not know what had happened to me.	Ma garanayn waxa igu dhacay.
It sounds like a great idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad weyn.
I think they are very good	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u wanaagsan yihiin
This is also not very big.	Tani sidoo kale maaha mid aad u weyn.
I do not know what to do	Waxaan sameeyo ma garanayo
I wanted to, that's for sure	Waxaan rabay, taasi waa hubaal
I wasn’t a car person, really	Ma ahayn qof baabuur, run ahaantii
I had to tell her.	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I should have been here to help	Waxay ahayd inaan u joogo inaan ku caawiyo
Something else happened to me.	Wax kale ayaa igu dhacay.
said nothing	waxba ma odhan
Obviously not now.	Sida cad hadda maaha.
Do not do it yet.	Weli ha samayn.
I just need to talk to you	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
I would love to know what is here	Aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado waxa halkan ku jira
He couldn't believe how good it was.	Wuu rumaysan waayay sida ay u wanaagsan tahay.
Something was going to happen.	Wax baa dhici lahaa.
And nothing.	Iyo waxba.
That is too much.	Taasi aad bay u badan tahay.
I looked good, mostly	Waxaan u muuqday mid fiican, inta badan
Which is not a bad thing.	Taas oo aan wax xun ahayn.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
This should not be the case.	Tani waa inaysan sidaas noqon.
It was once.	Mar bay mid ahayd.
I don't think so now.	Hadda uma maleynayo.
But it was a good place.	Laakiin waxay ahayd meel fiican.
I want to be with him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la joogo
I wanted to talk to him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo.
I can not be clearer than that	Ma noqon karo mid taas ka cad
Everyone wants one.	Qof kastaa mid buu rabaa.
No one will help me.	Qofna ima caawin doono.
But not now.	Laakiin hadda maaha.
.	.
I felt he was tall.	Waxaan dareemay inuu dheer yahay.
I can clearly see	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa
I have no idea that	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo taas
It will be.	Waxay noqon doontaa.
Most others have done it once.	Inta badan dadka kale ayaa sameeyay hal mar.
I know this will not stop you	Waan ogahay in tani aysan ku joojin doonin
I got nothing.	Waxba ma helin.
You can go to school if you want.	Waxaad aadi kartaa dugsiga haddii aad rabto.
I have something to tell you.	wax aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa.
I would be	waan ahaan lahaa
Several things came from this.	Waxyaabo dhowr ah ayaa tan ka yimid.
They found nothing.	Waxba ma ay helin.
But enough of this now.	Laakiin ku filan tan hadda.
There is still something.	Weli wax baa jira.
I want to go home	Waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado
I have not been one for a while	In muddo ah maan mid noqon
I am not	Ma ihi
I can never do anything clearly.	Weligay wax si cad uma samayn karo.
He can go home.	Wuxuu aadi karaa guriga.
I think they are so beautiful and beautiful	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u qurux badan yihiin oo qurux badan yihiin
More than a nuisance	In ka badan dhib badan
He never did.	Waligiis ma qaban.
I am afraid of everything.	Wax walba waan ka baqayaa.
I always do, busy	Had iyo jeer waan sameeyaa, mashquul
You can leave at any time.	Waad iska bixi kartaa wakhti kasta.
I saw all the bad	Waxaan arkay dhammaan wixii xun
I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or not	Ma hubo inay taasi tahay wax xun iyo in kale
He heard there was work.	Wuxuu maqlay inay shaqo jirto.
What it is and how to learn it.	Waxa ay tahay iyo sida loo barto.
I have a long-term job.	Waxaan hayaa shaqo waqti dheer ah.
I know you want that	Waan ogahay inaad taas rabto
He said maybe he would do it.	Wuxuu yidhi malaha wuu yeeli lahaa.
What is it.	Waa maxay waxa ah.
This, here.	Tani, halkan.
When he really looked at me.	Markii uu runtii i eegay.
Unknown.	Lama yaqaan.
I got into trouble back home	Waxaan galay dhibaato guriga dib
Each of us wanted to be him.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah wuxuu rabay inuu isaga noqdo.
I wanted to go there	Waxaan rabay inaan aado halkaas
I liked him, a lot	Waan ka helay isaga, wax badan
I do.	waan sameeyaa.
I am with a friend	Waxaan la joogaa saaxiib
I've never had a problem	Weligay dhib kuma arag
He could no longer do this.	Mar dambe ma uu samayn karin tan.
We would see each other again.	Mar kale ayaan is arki lahayn.
You must have done the same.	Waa sidoo kale inaad sidaas samaysay.
I did not want to talk to him	Maan rabin inaan wax kala hadlo
But no one is sure.	Laakiin qofna ma hubo.
I will find you.	Waan ku heli doonaa.
But she did not think it would happen here.	Laakiin uma ay malaynayn inay halkan ka dhici doonto.
She had many friends.	Waxay lahayd saaxiibo badan.
It may take some time but it can be done.	Waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti laakiin waa la samayn karaa.
I think someone told him.	Waxaan filayaa in qof u sheegay.
Whether one was real or not.	Haddii mid ka mid ah uu ahaa mid dhab ah iyo haddii kale.
I seem to be gaining new abilities every day	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan helay awoodo cusub maalin kasta
I was so impressed with him	Aad ayaan ugu dhacay isaga
He will stay home tomorrow.	Berri ayuu guriga joogi doonaa.
Not everyone is like that.	Qof walba sidaas uma aha.
At first they didn’t take me.	Markii hore ima ay qaadan.
Very difficult.	Aad u adag.
It just can’t be better	Kaliya ma fiicnaan karo
That may not be what you want.	Taasi ma noqon karto waxa aad rabto.
I want something better	Waxaan rabaa wax ka fiican
Not that I think it is true	Ma aha inaan u malayn inay run tahay
I want to help people	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo dadka
I didn't have to	Ma ahayn inaan sameeyo
I want you to do it.	Waxaan rabaa inaad sameyso.
But he could not see.	Laakiin taas wuu arki waayay.
I wonder what he will do about it.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu ka yeeli doono.
I do not know what that could be	Ma garanayo waxa ay taasi noqon karto
I want to be here too	Waxaan rabaa inaan sidoo kale halkaan joogo
There is something for everyone.	Qof walba wax baa jira.
Lots of food.	Cunto badan.
I'm sure there must be something similar	Waxaan hubaa inay tahay inay jiraan wax la mid ah
You have the right man.	Waxaad leedahay nin sax ah.
I have a lot going on	Wax badan baa iga socda
Is that what happened?	Ma waxa dhacay.
Another one.	Mid kale.
Both are very complex.	Labaduba aad bay u adag yihiin.
But that will take time.	Laakiin taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
But over time they will.	Laakiin waqti ka dib way dhici doonaan.
He must.	Waa inuu.
I have to know.	Waa inaan ogaado.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
Not everyone can do it.	Qof kastaa ma samayn karo.
That was what she did.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ay samaysay.
He would do things for the people he loved.	Dadka uu jecel yahay ayuu wax u qaban lahaa.
It was still a day.	Weli maalin bay ahayd.
You can fall	Waad ku dhici kartaa
I wanted to be friends again.	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale saaxiibo la noqdo.
Very little.	Runtii aad u yar.
He did well.	Si fiican buu u sameeyay.
I will never love anyone else	Weligay qof kale ma jeclaan doono
I can still say he is not here	Waxaan weli sheegi karaa inuusan halkan joogin
That's right again.	Waa sax mar kale.
And no time.	Oo aan waqti lahayn.
Runtii really.	Runtii runtii.
But I will do that later.	Laakiin taas mar dambe ayaan samayn doonaa.
Where.	Aaway.
I did not even know they existed	Xitaa ma aan ogayn inay jiraan
That was a problem.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhibaato.
I can't say anything else.	Wax kale ma odhan karo.
I know what happened	Waan ogahay waxa dhacay
He was alone.	Keligiis ayuu ahaa.
You will love him.	Waad jeclaan doontaa isaga.
I will not say anything.	Waxba odhan maayo.
I can't believe what happened	Ma rumaysan karo waxa dhacay
I could not believe it, someone like me	Ma rumaysan karin, qof aniga oo kale ah
I am very sorry for what happened	Aad baan uga xumahay wixii dhacay
Now no one seems to be at home.	Hadda qofna uma eka inuu guriga joogo.
The main reason was you.	Sababta ugu weyn waxay ahayd adiga.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
He took no money.	Wax lacag ah ma uu qaadan.
Very good friends.	Saaxiibo aad u wanaagsan.
Not a big deal, after all.	Wax weyn maaha, ka dib oo dhan.
Take that, really.	Qaado taas, runtii.
I did not want to be a foodie	Maan rabin inaan cunto u noqdo
I know you may not be able to tell me	Waan ogahay in laga yaabo inaadan ii sheegi karin
A place where no one lives	Meel aan cidna lahayn
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
I can go now	Hadda waan tagi karaa
So small is beautiful.	Sidaas yar ayaa qurux badan.
I got all the work	Waxa aan helay shaqada oo dhan
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono .
But he seemed to feel he would do it.	Laakiin waxa uu u muuqday in uu dareemay in uu samayn doono.
I tried	waan isku dayay
She loves me.	Way i jeceshahay.
I just want to see you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko
I have to stay the day after tomorrow	Waa inaan joogo maalin ka dib berri
I will never do anything like this	Weligay ma samayn doono wax sidaas oo kale ah
Maybe one year.	Laga yaabaa in hal sano ah.
I know it's not right.	Waan ogahay inaysan sax ahayn.
That is good.	Taasi waa wanaagsan tahay.
I just don’t know where to leave here.	Kaliya ma garanayo meel aan ka tago halkan.
It's hard, but it will happen.	Way adag tahay, laakiin way dhici doontaa.
Maybe that can help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ku caawin karto.
I have not yet told anyone what happened	Weli cidna uma sheegin wixii dhacay
I would think that.	Waxaan u malayn lahaa taas.
I was somewhere else	Waxaan joogay meel kale
He was so beautiful.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u qurux badan.
I told him it was not, but it was a lie	Waxaan u sheegay in uusan ahayn, laakiin waa been
You will not find it here.	Halkan kuma heli doono.
She needs it.	Waxay u baahan tahay.
She is not at home.	Ma joogto guriga.
I could not do anything else	Wax kale maan samayn karin
I can't afford it	Ma awoodo inaan diyaar u noqon
I expect good from you	Wax wanaagsan baan kaa filayaa
Now I can talk about other things	Hadda waxaan ka hadli karaa waxyaabo kale
If you want, bring it.	Haddii aad rabto, soo qaado.
It does not seem to exist.	Waxay u egtahay inuusan jirin.
So far clearly.	Ilaa hadda si cad.
But, she did.	Laakiin, way samaysay.
He will need more.	Wax badan ayuu u baahan doonaa.
I'm glad you said that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad sidaas tidhi.
I want her to be there	Waxaan rabaa inay halkaas joogto
No money.	Malaha lacag.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
He was in trouble, a big problem.	Waxa uu ku jiray dhibaato, dhibaato weyn.
I can leave at any time	Waqti kasta waan ka bixi karaa
She didn't want any problems.	Ma aysan rabin wax dhibaato ah.
I wanted to work with him	Waxaan rabay inaan la shaqeeyo
I just did not know it was so	Kaliya maan ogeyn inay sidaas tahay
I did, really.	waan sameeyay, runtii.
Several times.	Dhowr jeer.
He could not have come for a better time.	Ma uusan iman karin waqti ka wanaagsan.
I just love seeing this.	Kaliya waxaan jeclahay inaan arko tan.
You can get that.	Waad heli kartaa taas.
He has to do the right thing.	Waa inuu wax sax ah samaynayo.
I have never done anything like this.	Weligay wax sidaas oo kale ah ma samayn.
But they are in trouble.	Laakiin dhib bay ku jiraan.
I can stop this now	Waan joojin karaa tan hadda
I make more money than he does.	Waxaan sameeyaa lacag ka badan inta uu sameeyo.
I want to talk to you alone	Waxaan rabaa inaan keligaa kula hadlo
He is in everything.	Wax walba wuu ku jiraa.
He said something difficult.	Si dhib ah ayuu wax ugu sheegay.
I haven't had that in a long time	Taas maan helin muddo aad u dheer
I hope we can help each other.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan is caawin karno.
But that was nothing new.	Laakiin taasi wax cusub ma ahayn.
I hope you will do the same	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto
I knew it would happen, one day	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto, maalin
I think there is a chance they will do something good	Waxaan filayaa inay jirto fursad ay wax wanaagsan samayn doonaan
Nothing more today.	Ma jiro wax ka badan maanta.
Obviously, that is what happened.	Sida cad, taasi waa waxa dhacay.
I hope you will see why	Waxaan filayaa inaad arki doonto sababta
You can talk to me	Waad ila hadli kartaa
I wanted to help everyone	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo qof walba
No one knew he was here.	Qofna ma ogayn inuu halkan joogo.
I wanted to talk to him	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo
I thought so.	Waxaan u maleeyay sidaas.
I told you he was a little surprised	Waxaan kuu sheegay inuu yara yaabay
But he was surprised.	Laakiin wuu yaabay.
I should have had it now	Waxay ahayd inaan hadda haysto
I tried to do something good.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sameeyo wax fiican.
He just told me.	Kaliya wuu ii sheegay.
But I am not able to do that.	Laakiin ma awoodo inaan sidaas sameeyo.
And he says.	Oo uu leeyahay.
I think you can do it	Waxaan filayaa inaad samayn karto
This is my favorite	Waa kan aan jeclahay
As someone said something similar.	Sidii qof u sheegay wax la mid ah.
Something very big is going to happen.	Wax aad u weyn ayaa soo bixi doona.
I always knew it was a lie	Mar walba waan ogaa inay been tahay
I don't mind that.	Dhib uma arko taas.
I do not have to speak	Ma aha inaan hadlo
I did not want to have anything to do with it	Ma rabin in aan wax ku leeyahay
Not really sure why.	Runtii ma hubo sababta.
You will love this.	Waad jeclaan doontaa tan.
I should not have said that to you	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas kula hadlo
It can not be very interesting.	Ma noqon karto mid aad u xiiso badan.
Once he loves you, he loves you.	Mar uu ku jecel yahay, wuu ku jecel yahay.
What he did to you.	Muxuu ku sameeyay.
I would be tough	Waxaan noqon lahaa mid adag
But nothing came of it.	Laakiin ma jirin wax ka soo baxay.
It's hard.	Way adag tahay.
I looked again	Mar kale ayaan eegay
We will see what we can do about it.	Waan arki doonaa waxa aan taas ka qaban karno.
It was everything he did.	Waxay ahayd wax kasta oo uu sameeyo.
I'm sure it won't be, but it shouldn't be.	Waan hubaa inaysan ahaan doonin, laakiin waa inaysan ahaan doonin.
I did not know what this would accomplish	Maan garanayn waxa ay tani ku guulaysan doonto
I saw it recently.	Waxaan arkay dhawaan.
That is amazing.	Taasi waa yaab.
I hope she does the same for you!	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas oo kale kugu sameyso!
As it was.	Sidii ay ahayd.
I once did that.	Mar ayaan taas sameeyay.
I am happy to help.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan caawiyo.
It was an amazing day.	Waxay ahayd maalin yaab leh.
Nothing has been done yet.	Weli waxba lama qaban.
It is here	Waa halkan
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
Either way it has always been a problem.	Si kasta oo kale ayaa had iyo jeer ahaa dhibaato.
I could not say what it was	Ma sheegi karin waxay ahayd
I may leave the living	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan kan nool ka baxo
I have no idea if it was real or not.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay dhab ahayd iyo in kale.
And something else as well.	Iyo wax kale sidoo kale.
She really didn't understand.	Dhab ahaantii ma ay fahmin.
I know you are not.	Waan ogahay inaadan ahayn.
I can give her anything she wants	Wax kasta oo ay rabto waan siin karaa
And there it is.	Oo waxaa jira.
But this is not a new problem.	Laakiin tani maaha dhibaato cusub.
He is a man.	Waa nin.
Maybe I won't do it again	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan mar dambe sameyn doonin
I'm happy	waan ku faraxsanahay
I told only one friend.	Waxaan u sheegay hal saaxiib oo kaliya.
Most did not come here.	Inta badan halkan ma iman.
I was all this	Waxaan ahaa tan oo dhan
But there were other things, too.	Laakiin waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
A little for you	Wax yar adiga
There is nothing new.	Ma jiraan wax ku cusub.
So, I'll see.	Marka, waan arki doonaa.
He was still with me.	Weli wuu ila joogay.
Time to do your best.	Waqti aad ku sameyso waxa ugu fiican.
They are for everyone.	Waxay u yihiin qof walba.
I can stay here for you	Waan kuu joogi karaa halkan
You look good enough.	Waxaad u egtahay mid ku filan.
I never stopped telling him	Weligay ma joojin inaan u sheego
I never knew you could find someone you love	Maan ogeyn inaad heli karto qof aad jeceshahay
This was another day of work for us.	Tani waxay ahayd maalin kale oo shaqada noo ah.
It is something new and bad.	Waa wax cusub oo xun.
I haven't really seen anyone in a long time	Anigu qof si dhab ah uma arag muddo dheer
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
He thought it was very good.	Wuxuu mooday inay aad u wanaagsan tahay.
She likes to do that all the time.	Waxay jeceshahay inay taas samayso had iyo jeer.
I also like to have something that no one else has	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclahay inaan haysto wax qofna uusan haysan
I have not seen anything bad	Wax xun maan arag
I owe you everything	Wax walba waan ku leeyahay
It was also true.	Sidoo kale run bay ahayd.
If you were one of them.	Haddii aad ka mid ahayd sidaas.
There was not a single chance.	Hal fursad ma jirin.
He knew he could do it.	Wuu ogaa inuu samayn karo.
He is back.	Wuu soo noqday.
In person.	Qof ahaan.
I think you can make a lot of money for me	Waxaan filayaa inaad lacag badan ii samayn karto
I'm sure they will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa inay fiicnaan doonaan.
This is not.	Tani ma aha.
I have to know	Waa inaan ogahay
I really did not know what to do.	Runtii maan garanayn waxaan sameeyo.
I will stop	waan joojin doonaa
But it is not a big deal.	Laakiin ma aha wax weyn.
I had no problems	Wax dhibaato ah ma helin
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I already have something for work	Wax hore ayaan u hayaa shaqada
As you can see, there are none.	Sida aad arki karto, ma jiraan.
That is why.	Waa sababta ay.
Less is always more.	In ka yar ayaa had iyo jeer ka badan.
I wish you were here with us.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan nala joogto.
You are very fast.	Aad baad u degdeg badan tahay.
That is what we do.	Taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
I hope you find it amazing	Waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto waxyaabo yaab leh
I just love you and I want what is best for you	Waan ku jeclahay oo kaliya waxaan rabaa waxa kuu fiican
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
Otherwise I would be in the room	Haddii kale qolka waan joogi lahaa
You did that.	Adiga ayaa taas sameeyay.
I knew it was for me	Waan ogaa inuu ii ahaa
I will not let her do it.	Uma ogolaan doono inay sameyso.
She said she was not ready.	Waxay sheegtay inaysan diyaar u ahayn.
I doubt it.	Waan ka shakisanahay.
As you may wish.	Sida laga yaabo inaad doonto.
He came back.	Dib buu u soo noqday.
I am ready to work now	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan hadda shaqeeyo
No one knows this.	Qofna ma garanayo tan.
I can no longer give.	Mar dambe ma siin karo.
I have nothing but time	Ma haysto wax aan wakhti ahayn
You are probably like him.	Waxaad u badan tahay isaga oo kale.
I know where you are	Waan ogahay meesha aad joogto
You know it's nothing.	Waad ogtahay inaysan waxba ahayn.
I don't know what to expect	Ma garanayo waxaan filan karo
If you really want to.	Haddii aad runtii rabto.
We will do whatever you want	Waxaan sameyn doonaa waxaad doonto
I heard it differently	Si kale ayaan u maqlay
I looked at him intently	Aad ayaan u eegay isaga
But that has time and place.	Laakiin taasi waxay leedahay waqti iyo meel.
I hope you find something you like here	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad halkan ka heli doonto wax aad jeceshahay
I thought it was beautiful	Waxaan u malayn jiray inay qurux badan tahay
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
I want you to be there	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaas joogto
She said a lot.	Wax badan bay tidhi.
Friend, who seemed more than a friend	Saaxiib, oo u muuqday in ka badan saaxiib
Not too long.	Ma aha muddo aad u dheer.
You are me.	Waxaad tahay aniga.
I wonder if he knows me so well	Waxaan la yaabanahay in uu sidaas ii yaqaan
Now he had one small problem to deal with.	Hadda wuxuu lahaa hal dhib yar oo uu wax ka qaban lahaa.
He said it was nothing.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay waxba ahayn.
I can no longer help	Mar dambe ma caawin karo
First as needed.	Marka hore si loo baahan yahay.
Take this.	Kan qaado.
There is difficulty	Waxaa jira adag
You, me, everyone.	Adiga, aniga, qof walba.
So much.	Wax aad u badan.
Something was taken from me.	Wax baa la iga qaaday.
I can’t do it for him, either	Anigu ma samayn karo isaga, sidoo kale
We'll see to it.	Waan arki doonaa in la sameeyo.
I can't do that now	Taas hadda ma samayn karo
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor.
I think you could have done better.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad wax ka wanaagsan samayn lahayd.
He felt he was really there.	Waxa uu dareemay in uu dhab ahaan halkaas joogo.
He liked it.	Wuu ka helay.
I look forward to seeing you there !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkaas!.
I was surprised she would be here	Waxaan la yaabay inay halkan joogi lahayd
I saw something for you	Wax baan kugu arkay
He tried to speak.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu hadlo.
I made a promise	Ballan baan u qaaday
It is still here	Wali waa halkan
Just a little bit.	Kaliya wax yar.
I will find someone else.	Waxaan heli doonaa qof kale.
That would be smart.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd mid caqli badan.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
I can't see anything bad	Wax xun ma arki karo
It’s like everything.	Waa sida wax kasta.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
I'm sorry.	waan ka xumahay.
He seemed to do nothing.	Waxa uu u muuqday in aanu waxba samayn.
I think it was right	Waxaan filayaa inay sax ahayd
They may not pay much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan bixin wax badan.
All I want is to be with you again.	Waxa kaliya ee aan rabo waa inaan mar kale kula joogo.
It is every day.	Waa maalin walba.
I think they are ready now	Waxaan filayaa inay diyaar yihiin hadda
Probably mostly for sure.	Malaha inta badan run ahaantii.
As it was.	Sida uu ahaa.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
I still don't have to be here	Wali ma ahan inaan halkaan joogo
A lot is going on for me	Wax badan ayaa ii socda
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
I am very happy about this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
I was not ready for that yet	Wali diyaar uma ahayn taas
I can't do that.	Ma awoodo inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I want to do something	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax sameeyo
I started to wonder	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay
But here it was.	Laakiin halkan waxay ahayd.
Something was right.	Wax baa sax ahaa.
But I will do well.	Laakiin si fiican ayaan u qaban doonaa.
Amazing here.	La yaab leh halkan.
He had no idea he was too young.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inuu aad u yar yahay.
I really wanted to get to know him better	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan sii barto isaga
You can't go home.	Guriga ma aadi karto.
I think he did.	Waxaan filayaa inuu sameeyay.
A little fell.	In yar soo dhacay.
I wondered why she did it	Waxaan la yaabay sababta ay u samaysay
I knew where he lived, now	Waan ogaa meesha uu ku nool yahay, hadda
There is not enough money.	Lacag ku filan ma jirto.
Good idea, but not very accurate	Fikrad fiican, laakiin ma aha mid aad u sax ah
I thought it would be interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon doonto mid xiiso leh.
To be present when someone needs it.	In ay joogto marka ay qof u baahan tahay.
I did not know you would be here	Maan ogayn inaad halkan joogi doonto
I can only do so much	Kaliya wax badan ayaan qaban karaa
In fact, there wasn’t much else I could do.	Runtii, ma jirin wax kale oo badan oo aan sameeyo.
It is given	Waa la siiyay
That has to be done.	Taasi waa in la sameeyaa.
But not now, not now.	Laakiin hadda maaha, hadda maaha.
That's good, that's good.	Taasi waa wax fiican, taasi waa fiican tahay.
We need you.	Waanu kuu baahanahay.
Do everything for me.	Wax walba igu qabo.
I want you to be there with me	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaas ila joogto
I think you are something else	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad tahay wax kale
Also a lot of money.	Sidoo kale lacag badan.
Not as if this is something new.	Ma aha sida haddii tani ay tahay wax cusub.
He did something.	Wax buu sameeyay.
It's a big deal.	Waa wax aad u weyn.
There was something more difficult than you.	Waxaa jiray wax ka adag adiga.
I did not see the next one	Maan arag soo socda
I think he knew.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ogaa.
An appointment is required.	Ballan ayaa loo baahan yahay.
I did not spend much time there	Waqti badan kuma aan qaadan halkaas
As you can tell.	Sida aad sheegi karto.
No wonder he loves me more than you.	La yaab ma leh inuu iga jecel yahay adiga.
I can clearly see it now	Si cad ayaan hadda u arki karaa
I have already spent a lot of time on it.	Waqti badan ayaan hore ugu qaatay.
I wonder how it will be	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay noqon doonto
I have not said it yet	Wali uma sheegin
Small things.	Waxyaabo yar yar.
I should have told you earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan wakhti hore kuu sheego
That’s fine, it’s not very smart.	Taasi waa si fiican, ma aha mid aad u caqli badan.
He was at home again.	Mar kale ayuu guriga joogay.
I picked up another and did the same	Mid kale ayaan soo qaatay oo sidii oo kale ayaan sameeyay
I can give you everything you need	Waxaan ku siin karaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan karto
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
I promised you a long time ago	Waa hore ayaan ballan kuu qaaday
It looks really good.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid aad u fiican runtii.
I really had.	Runtii waan lahaa.
I can't see and I don't have anyone	Ma arki karo qofna ma haysto
Is jecel.	Is jecel.
I have not seen it any other way.	Si kale uma arag.
I know you want this.	Waan ogahay inaad tan rabto.
I was ready to help.	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan caawiyo.
And there is something else.	Oo wax kale ayaa jira.
He is not a real person.	Ma aha qof dhab ah.
That's when he left.	Waa markii uu ka baxay.
And maybe not for long.	Oo laga yaabo in aan muddo dheer.
I got you.	Waan ku helay.
This was new to me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd mid igu cusub.
I did not give	Maan siin
Lots of money, friend.	Lacag aad u badan, saaxiib.
Maybe more, really.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii badan, dhab ahaantii.
I know what she wants.	Waan ogahay waxay rabto.
I wanted to leave school and go home	Waxaan rabay inaan dugsiga ka tago oo aan guriga aado
Me and you.	Aniga iyo adiga.
I had no problems	Wax dhibaato ah ma helin
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
You are something.	Wax baad tahay.
I was so.	Waxaan ahaa sidaas.
I know enough of you not to do that.	Waan ogahay in kugu filan in aanan taas samayn.
I have to know exactly who he is	Waa inaan si sax ah u garanayaa qofka uu yahay
That was the right thing to do.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
There was no other.	Mid kale ma jirin.
I wanted to be surprised	Waxaan rabay inaan la yaabo
I would like to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo
I'm sure she is like him.	Waxaan hubaa inay isaga la mid tahay.
She only did it a few times.	Kaliya waxay samaysay dhowr jeer.
I need you to tell me everything	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad wax walba ii sheegto
That is the good thing.	Taasi waa waxa fiican.
I know it will happen	Waan ogahay inay dhici doonto
I would like her to know how to do it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay ogaato sida loo sameeyo.
I do not understand why this is so.	Ma fahmin sababta ay tani sidaas u tahay.
One is smart.	Mid waa caqli.
I have to go	Waa inaan tago
This is probably what happened to you.	Tani waxay u badan tahay waxa kugu dhacay.
I have never seen that before.	Weligay taas hore uma arag.
In fact, that is how it is.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa sida ay tahay.
I will get another one.	Mid kale ayaan ku heli doonaa.
I just want better food	Kaliya waxaan rabaa cunto ka wanaagsan
He knew what would happen.	Wuu ogaa wax dhici doona.
This is work.	Tani waa shaqo.
I can clearly see	Si cad ayaan u arki karaa
But there is nothing else here.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax kale halkan.
I told him you are the best.	Waxaan u sheegay in aad tahay kan ugu fiican.
Only	Kaliya
He ate the same food.	Cunto isku mid ah ayuu soo qaatay.
I thought it was weird.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay yaab lahayd.
I am what you are	Aniga ayaa ah waxa aad tahay
I don't know now.	Hadda ma garanayo.
I was still.	weli waan ahaa.
I really know what you are	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa waxaad tahay
Work there if you could.	Shaqada halkaas haddii aad heli lahayd.
I just have to have him	Kaliya waa inaan haysto isaga
I think that is as far as I go	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi tahay ilaa inta aan tagi doono
Maybe he'll get better.	Malaha wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
I love that	Waan jeclahay taas
I heard there are you know	Waxaan maqlay inay jiraan waad ogtahay
You can see the house.	Waad arki kartaa guriga.
I could not see.	Waan arki waayay.
That, too, is obviously true.	Taas, sidoo kale, waa sida iska cad run.
It will stay, too.	Way joogi doontaa, sidoo kale.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
tell me how it feels for you.	ii sheeg sida ay adiga kugu tahay.
It is very real.	Aad bay u dhab tahay.
He went.	Wuu aaday.
I came back to you	Waan ku soo noqday
I wonder if you can help me with that	Waxaan la yaabanahay inaad taas iga caawin karto
That would be interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
A lot like you, really.	Wax badan adiga oo kale, dhab ahaantii.
He will not leave.	Ma bixi doono.
I didn't even do that	Xitaa taas maan samayn
I knew it would be good	Waan ogaa inay fiicnaan doonto
I can't believe this.	Ma rumaysan karo tan.
I really know they do	Runtii waan ogahay inay sameeyaan
It is needed.	Waa loo baahan yahay.
I knew it belonged to me	Waan ogaa inay aniga ii leedahay
You can do better there.	Halkaas ayaad ku fiicnaan kartaa.
Really long time	Runtii waqti aad u dheer
I have not seen anyone	Qofna maan arag
I was not ready for this	Diyaar uma ahayn tan
Maybe you are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tahay.
They like to do that.	Waxay jecel yihiin inay sidaas sameeyaan.
I could not, I did not stop, to see him	Maan awoodin, ma joojin, inaan arko isaga
I knew he wanted to do other things	Waan ogaa inuu doonayo inuu sameeyo waxyaabo kale
I hope we will get better	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan fiicnaan doono
I could not see very well.	Si fiican wax uma arki karin.
I really think it was the best.	Waxaan runtii u maleynayaa inay ahayd tan ugu fiican.
I need his help	Waxaan u baahanahay inuu i caawiyo
I was amazed like everyone else	Waxaan la yaabay sida dadka kale oo dhan
I would like to know more about it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado
I am not here today	Anigu maanta ma joogo
I think I will leave	Waxaan filayaa inaan ka bixi doono
I really tried	Runtii waan isku dayay
I'm glad you like it	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad jeceshahay
If you could talk to him that would be nice.	Haddii aad la hadli karto isaga taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
You can definitely do it.	Dhab ahaantii waad sameyn kartaa.
It will not make money.	Lacag ma samayn doonto.
I had some good years	Waxaan lahaa xoogaa sano oo wanaagsan
I expect a lot.	wax badan ayaan filayaa.
That may once have been true, but not now.	Taasi waxa laga yaabaa inay mar run ahayd, laakiin hadda ma jirto.
There is none.	Ma jirto.
That is what will happen.	Taasi waa waxa dhici doona.
I could not see where you went	Meesha aad aaday ayaan arki waayay
I know very well what she will say.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa waxay odhan doonto.
I pretended to be a friend	Waxaan iska dhigay sidii saaxiib
He did not come.	Ma iman.
I am a bit.	Waxaan ahay xoogaa.
I should be happy about that	Waa inaan ku faraxsanahay taas
Lots of food.	Cunto badan oo badan.
As she says.	Sida ay leedahay.
I thought this was a good idea	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan
I really do not know what to do now	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo hadda
Now that would be something.	Hadda taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax.
I haven't seen it in a long time	Maan arag muddo dheer
I did nothing	waxba maan qaban
I think that is a good idea	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay fikrad fiican
I got better	Waxaan helay wax ka sii fiican
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
But, well, here it is.	Laakiin, si fiican, halkan waa.
The best place.	Meesha ugu fiican.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I had no idea this could be done	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn in tan la samayn karo
I will not leave.	Ka tagi maayo.
Everyone is too tall.	Qof walba aad buu u dheer yahay.
I did not want to see you	Ma rabin inaan ku arko
This is true.	Tani waa dhab.
I could not find anything better to do.	Wax iga fiican oo aan sameeyo maan helin.
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
I want him to know that	Waxaan rabaa inuu taas ogaado
I got something	Wax baan helay
This is obvious.	Tani waa wax iska cad.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
This may not be the case.	Tani waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
He looked at me like that.	Wuu i eegay sidaas.
I did not want to	Ma aanan rabin
They had no time.	Wax wakhti ah ma ay helin.
I always liked it	Had iyo jeer waan ka helay
I just want her to know how true that is	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inay ogaato sida ay taasi run u tahay
We'll see you a bit.	Waanu ku arki doonaa xoogaa.
I could not let him go	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu baxo
I did not believe him	Maan rumaysan isaga
We like her to be with us	Waanu jeclayn inay nala joogto
You do not have to.	Ma aha inaad.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
I want to know how well it works.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida wanaagsan ee uu u shaqeeyo.
It is not done.	Ma aha wax la sameeyay.
Probably not much.	Malaha wax badan.
That was something he had not yet done.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax uusan weli wax ka qaban.
He took it personally.	Qof ahaan buu u qaatay.
I wonder what happened to me	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa igu dhacay
I know where he will be.	Waan ogahay meesha uu joogi doono.
I will not say much about this	Wax badan ka sheegi maayo arrintan
I have other things.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo kale.
I still do that.	Weli taas ayaan sameeyaa.
He should not be able to buy it.	Waa inuusan awoodin inuu iibsado.
He is who we are.	Waa cidda aan nahay.
I need to tell you.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kuu sheego.
I knew what he was doing.	Waan ogaa waxa uu samaynayo.
You will be fine here	Waad ku fiicnaan doontaa halkan
They will not get it.	Ma heli doonaan.
I don't like it now.	Ma jecli hadda.
This was good.	Tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I could not see people	Dadka maan arki karin
That was him.	Taasi waxay ahayd isaga.
I tried to help him	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo isaga
She needs me.	Way ii baahan tahay.
How to do it.	Sida loo sameeyo.
Take what you want.	Qaado waxaad rabto.
And to be held.	Iyo in la haysto.
And who it could be.	Iyo cidda ay noqon karto.
It's beautiful.	Waa qurux.
I tried to find out	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado
I thought you would be fine	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad fiicnaan doonto
Nothing to see here.	Wax halkan lagu arko ma jiraan.
I hope it can happen	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici karto
A little goes here	Wax yar ayaa halkan u socda
He went there.	Halkaas ayuu aaday.
Very bad time.	Waqti aad u xun.
Everyone saw what happened	Qof kastaa wuu arkay waxa dhacay
I need your help.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad i caawiso.
I looked so bad, too	Waxaan u muuqday mid aad u xun, sidoo kale
I have three.	Saddex baan leeyahay.
No one was back home.	Qofna guriga dib uma joogin.
I will certainly do it.	Hubaal waan yeeli doonaa.
Please do not go	Fadlan ha tagin
Maybe it's true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu run yahay.
I have to do something	Waa inaan wax sameeyaa
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
I have not been there for a while	In muddo ah ma aan joogin halkaas
I know you are.	Waan ogahay inaad tahay.
The reason for this is still unknown.	Sababta arrintan ayaan weli la garanayn.
But this is true.	Laakiin tani waa run.
I hope you can do a lot of good	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax badan oo wanaagsan samayn karto
Something else is needed.	Wax kale ayaa loo baahan yahay.
I may not have another chance	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan fursad kale helin
It was small.	Wax yar bay ahayd.
I know they will not give me anything	Waan ogahay in aanay waxba i siin doonin
What happened was bad.	Waxa dhacay ayaa xun.
I was not ready yet	Wali diyaar uma ahayn
I was not in a good place.	Meel fiican maan joogin.
Let me know if you need anything.	I soo sheeg haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
I have something strange to tell you	Waxaan hayaa wax yaab leh oo aan kuu sheego
I know where she is	Waan ogahay halka ay joogto
No one knew how it would turn out.	Qofna ma ogeyn sida uu ku soo bixi doono.
I had him here	Waxaan isaga ku lahaa halkan
He is an unbelievable man.	Waa nin aan la rumaysan karin.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
But she will definitely be here more than anyone wants.	Laakiin hubaal inay halkan joogi doonto in ka badan inta qof kasta doonayo.
I just hope that is true	Kaliya waxaan rajeynayaa inay taasi run tahay
I think it is very strange	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u yaab badan tahay
He said he really liked it.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu aad uga helay.
I didn't want you to know.	Maan rabin inaad ogaato.
That is what he wants to do.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabo inuu sameeyo.
It seems to me to be true.	Waxa ay ila tahay mid dhab ah.
He wants to help us.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu na caawiyo.
I guess he is not at home	Waxaan filayaa inuusan guriga joogin
I know how good that would be.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u fiicnaan lahayd.
That is how long I will be here.	Taasi waa inta aan halkaan joogi doono.
I was not with him	Maan joogin isaga
Now tell me what you want.	Hadda ii sheeg waxaad rabto.
I am happy to be back at work.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan shaqada ku soo noqday.
Probably nothing.	Malaha waxba kuma jiraan.
He said he would get it too.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu heli doono xitaa.
He is sure.	Wuu hubaa.
I did not know until much later	Ma garanayn ilaa wax badan ka dib
i love you the way you are	waan ku jeclahay sida aad tahay
That is the only reason I have.	Taasi waa sababta kaliya ee aan haysto.
I am a true friend of you	Waxaan ahay saaxiib dhab ah adiga
I think that's the best	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi ugu fiican tahay
A lot of everything.	Wax badan oo dhan.
He really wanted to.	Runtii wuu rabay.
I just need to know	Waxaan kaliya u baahanahay inaan ogaado
I know you will get it	Waan ogahay inaad heli doonto
You will find many good things there.	Waxaad halkaas ka heli doontaa waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan.
Not a good idea.	Maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
There was something else.	Wax kale ayaa jiray.
He said something.	Wax buu yidhi.
Not so anymore.	Ma aha sidaas mar dambe.
I know everyone here	Waan ogahay qof walba halkan
I think he found us that way	Waxaan filayaa inuu sidaas nagu helay
I don't think he is a bad person	Uma maleynayo inuu yahay qof xun
I would get everything	Wax walba waan heli lahaa
I just want to help you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
I entered the room, but did not stay	Waxaan galay qolka, laakiin ma joogi
I want to be there	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas joogo
There are no problems so far.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan ilaa hadda.
I have never seen one so happy.	Weligay ma arag mid aad u faraxsan.
I still don't know anything	Wali waxba maan ogayn
I know how things are.	Waan ogahay sida ay wax yihiin.
I want to see money everywhere	Waxaan rabaa inaan meel walba ku arko lacag
I need something else.	Wax kale ayaan u baahanahay.
Every day, the same thing.	Maalin kasta, wax la mid ah.
Probably nothing.	Malaha waxba.
I think it is beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inuu qurux badan yahay
I have not been here for a while	In muddo ah maan joogin
I was a loving person	Waxaan ahaa qof jecel
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
But now tell me something else.	Laakiin hadda wax kale ii sheeg.
I can't make an appointment	Wax ballan ah ma samayn karo
I think he can help me	Waxaan filayaa inuu i caawin karo
This is a difficult time for me.	Wakhti adag ayaa igu adag arrintan.
I have a hard idea about that.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad adag taas.
I do not know why she is there	Ma garanayo sababta ay halkaas u joogto
That is always given.	Taasi mar walba waa la siiyay.
I wanted to see you	Waxaan rabay inaan ku arko
I knew that one of us could go	Waan ogaa in mid naga mid ah uu tagi karo
I can't do this, it's not like this	Ma samayn karo tan, sida tan oo kale maaha
I can do this at home	Waxaan taas ku samayn karaa guriga
No one knows who she is.	Qofna ma garanayo cidda ay tahay.
There is no urgency	Ma jiro degdeg
I wish it wasn't true, but it is	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan run ahayn, laakiin waa
You can do more.	Wax badan ayaad samayn kartaa.
I say please give me a job, any job.	Waxaan leeyahay fadlan shaqo i sii, shaqo kasta.
I just don't know who.	Kaliya ma garanayo cidda.
I am a real person.	Waxaan ahay qof dhab ah.
I have so much to learn!	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan ka barto!
I do everything hard	Wax walba si adag ayaan u sameeyaa
I heard things you would not believe	Waxaan maqlay waxyaabo aadan rumaysan doonin
I have seen many things	Waxaan arkay waxyaabo badan
I want everything you want	Waxaan rabaa wax kasta oo aad rabto
I wanted a place to go	Waxaan rabay meel aan aado
I tried to tell him that.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan taas u sheego.
But I no longer do it.	Laakiin mar dambe ma sameeyo.
He was there.	Wuu joogay.
I want to help people.	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo dadka.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Berri waa maalin cusub.
This was not a good thing.	Tani ma ahayn wax wanaagsan.
I still haven't had a chance to tell them	Weli maan helin fursad aan ugu sheego
You do not have to know.	Ma aha inaad ogaato.
I can not say.	Ma sheegi karo.
I just can't	Kaliya ma awoodo
I do not understand why he now wants to be friends	Maan fahmin sababta uu hadda u rabo in uu saaxiibo noqdo
I was the luckiest man, the luckiest man	Waxaan ahaa nin nasiib badan, nin ugu nasiib badan
I wanted to see more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan arko
Apparently not soon	Waxaa cad in aan dhawaan
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
I put it to work once	Hal mar ayaan shaqada u dhigay
I did not know that anyone else was here	Maan ogayn in qof kale halkan joogo
I wanted something to work on	Waxaan rabay wax aan ku shaqeeyo
I'm sorry to keep you here.	Waan ka xumahay in aan halkan kugu hayo.
He is new to what he has to do.	Waxa uu ku cusub yahay waxa ay tahay inuu sameeyo.
But that's the way it is.	Laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
I did not find another job	Meel kale maan helin wax shaqo ah
I want to be that for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan taas kuu noqdo
And, it was definitely a good idea.	Oo, hubaal waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I wouldn’t really take it	Si dhab ah uma qaadan lahayn
He really thought this was weird.	Waxa uu si dhab ah u maleeyay in tani ay tahay mid la yaab leh.
I wanted to see it up close	Waxaan rabay in aan meel dhow ku arko
I did not take any chances	Ma aanan qaadan wax fursad ah
I really did not have one	Runtii mid maan haysan
You think you will never see it again.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaadan dib dambe u arki doonin.
It's out.	Waa soo baxay.
I still do not know what she did, what she did	Wali maan garanayn waxay samaysay, waxay samaysay
I did not want money	Maan rabin lacag
She had a similar one.	Waxay lahayd mid la mid ah.
I need money, and more	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag, iyo wax badan
I think he should come with me	Waxay ila tahay inuu ila yimaado
But it was done.	Laakiin waa la sameeyay.
I do not want to know what you did	Ma rabo inaan ogaado waxaad samaysay
I will help him	waan caawin doonaa isaga
What has been tried has already been tried.	Waxa la isku dayay mar hore ayaa la isku dayay.
I thought that was a bit difficult	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi yara adag tahay
I want you to tell them	Waxaan rabaa inaad u sheegto
I could not tell you how	Waan kuu sheegi waayay sida
I did not know she was doing it	Maan ogayn inay samaynayso
Also as expected.	Sidoo kale sida la filan karo.
It is everything else true.	Waa wax kasta oo kale oo run ah.
A friend was with me	Saaxiib baa ila jiray
It just can’t be you.	Kaliya adiga ma noqon karto.
He does a little bit on a regular basis.	Waxa uu sameeyaa wax yar oo joogto ah.
They won't, here.	Ma samayn doonaan, halkan.
I was just there to be with him	Waxaan u jiray kaliya inaan isaga la joogo
A little harder	In yar oo adag
I really wanted to help	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan ku caawiyo
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
It was a little.	Waxay ahayd wax yar.
there is a lot to say if you want to.	waxaa jira wax badan oo lagu sheegi karo haddii aad rabto.
In fact, she already has.	Runtii, waxay hore u leedahay.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
In fact, we would stay.	Runtii, waanu joogi lahayn.
No one wants it here	Qofna kuma rabo halkan
That is the only thing she can do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay samayn karto.
I didn’t think they would really do it	Uma malaynayn inay dhab ahaantii samayn doonaan
I can't believe he really left	Ma rumaysan karo inuu runtii baxay
I love you so much, you	Aad baan kuu jeclahay, aad
I was in a hurry	Waxaan ahaa mid degdeg ah
Where he did not come	Meel aanu iman
happy not only me.	ku faraxsanahay ma aha aniga oo kaliya.
I am not the reason.	Aniga ma aha sababta.
I did not know you were in it today	Maan ogayn inaad maanta ku jirto
You can also come back.	Waxaad sidoo kale ku soo noqon kartaa.
I will not go home tonight	Caawa guriga tagi maayo
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
It really wasn't! 	Dhab ma ahayn!
I don't say that.	Uma sheego taas.
I would leave	Waan ka bixi lahaa
He lost what to do.	Waxa uu waayay wixii uu samayn lahaa.
He has three.	Saddex ayuu leeyahay.
It will be fine	Way fiicnaan doontaa
But it was not found.	Laakiin lama helin.
I am not	Ma ihi
You have a friend.	Waxaad leedahay saaxiib.
I would never say anything.	Weligay waxba ma odhan lahayn.
I wanted to tell them it was not true	Waxaan rabay inaan u sheego inaysan run ahayn
I just need to do it.	Waxaan u baahanahay oo kaliya inuu sameeyo.
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto.
I did not know.	Anigu maan garanayn.
It must be with me.	Waa inay aniga ila tahay.
I knew it wasn't a good thing	Waan ogaa in aanay wax wanaagsan ahayn
I thought there was no way out.	Waxaan u maleeyay in aysan jirin meel laga baxo.
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
I have to.	Waa inaan haysto.
He had nothing to say.	Wax uu u sheego ma jirin.
I have something else to say to you.	Wax kale oo aan kula hadlo ayaan hayaa.
I don’t think this was a good idea.	Uma malaynayo in tani ay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I had to tell her something	Waxay ahayd inaan wax u sheego
What to do was clear.	Waxa la sameeyo waxay ahayd mid cad.
I pretended to be like everyone else	Waxaan iska dhigay sidii qof kasta oo kale
I made a lot of friends	Waxaan helay saaxiibo badan
I really had one	Runtii mid baan ku lahaa
I had to stay home and work	Waxay ahayd inaan guriga joogo oo aan shaqeeyo
I knew that would be a lie	Waan ogaa inay taasi been noqon doonto
I am still.	weli waan ahay.
He said he did not know much about it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu wax badan ka garanayn.
Maybe he would be one of them.	Malaha wuu ka mid ahaan lahaa.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono
But not now.	Laakiin hadda maaha.
I have looked before	Hore ayaan u eegay
I can't say for sure	Ma sheegi karo runtii
I will not just leave	Kaliya iska tagi maayo
I fell for him, hard.	Waxaan u dhacay isaga, adag.
I need to leave now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda baxo
I want you to always be happy	Waxaan rabaa inaad mar walba faraxsan tahay
Something good came out of it.	Wax wanaagsan baa ka soo baxay.
Let me help you now.	Aan ku caawiyo hadda.
You have to stay here	Waa inaad halkaan joogto
He said he did not want to.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu rabin.
A little will not hurt	In yar waxba ma yeeli doonto
They will say what they want.	Waxay sheegi doonaan waxay doonaan.
A little later maybe, but not now.	Wax yar ka dib waa laga yaabaa, laakiin hadda maaha.
That was something she had to do.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax ay ahayd inay samayso.
It is for everyone else.	Waxay u tahay qof kasta oo kale.
You are a lot like me.	Waxaad tahay wax badan aniga oo kale ah.
It is good that you are able to help.	Way fiican tahay inaad awoodo inaad caawiso.
I just left	Kaliya waan ka tagay
I can't say anything good.	Wax fiican kama odhan karo.
I am very happy about that	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas
Maybe he would.	Malaha wuu yeeli lahaa.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
I'll see you tonight	caawa ayaan ku arki doonaa
We live well.	Waxaan u nool nahay si wanaagsan.
I think it would be nice to stay here	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan lahayd inaad halkan sii joogto
It is not an emergency.	Ma ahan wax degdeg ah.
She was still a new person.	Wali waxay ahayd qof cusub.
I want to be here now	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadda joogo
We can't do anything tonight.	Caawa waxba ma qaban karno.
I think they still exist	Waxaan filayaa inay weli jiraan
It would not happen	Uma dhici lahaa
So close.	Sidaas u dhow.
Now I need him.	Hadda waan u baahanahay isaga.
I know who she is.	Waan garanayaa cidda ay tahay.
I know she can do a lot	Waan ogahay inay wax badan qaban karto
That was awful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I would tell you if he has	Waan kuu sheegi lahaa haddii uu leeyahay
I will tell you what will be needed	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa loo baahan doono
I wondered what he really thought	Waxaan la yaabay waxa uu runtii u maleeyay
I will say it again.	Mar kale ayaan odhan doonaa.
In fact the latter may be greater.	Dhab ahaantii kan dambe ayaa laga yaabaa inuu ka weyn yahay.
I know he wants to help	Waan ogahay inuu doonayo inuu caawiyo
But that was a lie.	Laakiin taasi been bay ahayd.
There is something for everyone.	Qof walba wax baa jira.
I have no idea what to do.	Wax fikrad ah kama qabo inaan sameeyo.
They did not say.	Ma ay odhan.
I know everything there is to know about him	Waan ogahay wax walba oo jira inaan ka ogaado isaga
He went out to help.	Wuxuu u baxay inuu caawiyo.
He has done it before.	Hore ayuu u sameeyay.
You need to.	Aad u baahan tahay inaad.
Maybe that's it.	Malaha waa taas.
I want to help you with this	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa caawiyo tan
I was still the same	Weli sidii hore ayaan ahaa
I have not seen anyone	Qofna maan arag
I wish they did	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay sameeyaan
I can't believe otherwise	Si kale ma rumaysan karo
It was so much more.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
A difficult day.	Maalin adag.
I want to be with you for a while	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo xoogaa waqti ah
Maybe I'll come back later	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar dambe soo noqdo
I thought nothing else	Wax kale uma malaynayn
Not with him.	Ma isaga la.
I still have time	Weli wakhti ayaan hayaa
But I will see.	Laakiin waan arki doonaa.
I can't say much	Wax badan kama sheegi karo
It is what everyone would do.	Waa waxa qof kasta samayn lahaa.
I did not find it to be a problem.	Ma aan helin inay dhibaato tahay.
I looked at everyone	Qof walba waan eegay
I heard it was very good.	Waxaan maqlay inay aad u fiican tahay.
It will not be a problem	Dhib ma ahaan doono
No one knows anything.	Qofna waxba ma garanayo.
I want you to be with me	Waxaan rabaa inaad ila joogto
I know her well.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
I heard you.	Waan ku maqlay.
I wanted to say something, everything	Waxaan rabay inaan wax sheego, wax kasta
I'm sorry, but it can't happen.	Waan ka xumahay, laakiin ma dhici karto.
I had to find you again	Waxay ahayd inaan mar kale ku helo
Now there was no urgency.	Hadda ma jirin wax degdeg ah.
I was fun too	Waxaan ahaa mid xiiso leh sidoo kale
I was denied access	Waa la ii diiday inaan arko
But she should know better.	Laakiin waa inay si fiican u ogaato.
Everything else.	Wax kale oo dhan.
That's really it.	Runtii waa taas.
You obviously did.	Sida cad waad samaysay.
Where to go	Meesha aad tagi lahayd
I just want a real friend	Kaliya waxaan rabaa saaxiib dhab ah
Very little.	Si aad u yar.
The same can be said for me.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa la ii sheegi karaa.
Do not lie to others.	Been ha u sheegin dadka kale.
I would love to see it.	Jeclahay inaan arko.
I didn't even understand what was really going on	Xitaa ma fahmin waxa run ahaantii socda
Is that what happened?	Ma waxa dhacay.
I really don’t want to know.	Runtii runtii ma rabo inaan ogaado.
I will not stay.	Ma sii joogi doono.
I look forward to seeing you there	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkaas
He has already started.	Hore ayuu u bilaabay.
It was indeed a great day.	Runtii waxay u ahayd maalin aad u fiican.
I will not lie.	Been ka sheegi maayo.
That may be what you want.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa waxaad rabto.
I think that is very good	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi aad u wanaagsan tahay
There was nothing surprising here.	Ma jirin wax la yaab leh halkan.
I can't tell you here	Halkan kuma sheegi karo
Now, how much they still need you.	Hadda, inta ay weli kuu baahan yihiin.
He wanted to do something.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax sameeyo.
Probably a good one.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay mid fiican.
That's it and more.	Waa taas iyo in ka badan.
I took it	Wax baan u qaatay
He was smart enough.	Wuxuu ahaa caqli ku filan.
I know she can do it	Waan ogahay waxay samayn karto
I'm not even sure if it's correct.	Xitaa ma hubo inay sax tahay.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I really thought it would stay	Runtii waxaan u maleeyay inay sii joogi doonto
That would have been a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
you are like me.	waxaad tahay aniga oo kale.
Not everyone likes it.	Qof kastaa ma jecla.
He said.	Wuxuu yidhi.
I do something for it, maybe	Wax baan u sameeyaa, malaha
I felt very little.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u yar.
You can go	Waad tagi kartaa
He will stay.	Wuu joogi doonaa.
I was surprised he didn't already know	Waxaan la yaabay inuusan hore u ogeyn
But nothing comes of it.	Laakiin waxba ma yimaado.
I am very sorry.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay.
I do not know how to help.	Ma garanayo si aan u caawiyo.
I know how they are	Waan ogahay sida ay yihiin
I will be there soon now.	Dhawaan ayaan halkaas joogi doonaa hadda.
I do not know why they do it.	Ma garanayo sababta ay sidaas u sameeyaan.
I would help you	waan ku caawin lahaa
I am a very bad person.	Waxaan ahay qof aad u xun.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
He got a chance.	Fursad ayuu helay.
I can't speak right now	Hadda kama hadli karo
Shortly afterwards, he was at the back door	Wax yar ka dib, waxa uu joogay albaabka dambe
I can do this well.	Si fiican ayaan tan u samayn karaa.
There is so much to learn here, and so much to love.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo laga barto halkan, iyo wax badan oo la jecel yahay.
I did not give anything	Waxba maan siin
Now I know he wants this for me	Hadda waan ogahay inuu tan aniga ii rabo
He told me what he needed.	Wuxuu ii sheegay wuxuu u baahan yahay.
I don't like this.	Ma jecli tan.
You are everything.	Waxaad tahay wax walba.
We may not even need you	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa kuu baahnayn

I am so happy to have a friend like him	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan haysto saaxiib isaga oo kale ah
We need it.	Waanu u baahanahay.
He had a job.	Shaqo ayuu lahaa.
I had to come back to you	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu soo noqdo
I'm sure they didn't catch me.	Waxaan hubaa in aanay i qaban.
Not everyone is able to do that.	Qof walba ma awoodo inuu taas sameeyo.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
I have not seen anything live.	Wax nool ma arag.
No problems were found	Wax dhibaato ah lama arag
I could not find him, he could not find me	Waan heli waayay, wuu i heli waayay
I really enjoyed it here	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay halkan
I didn’t know it might be needed.	Maan ogayn in loo baahan karo.
Is everyone? 	Ma qof walba?
It was still there.	Hadda weli way ahayd.
I heard him, he heard me.	Waan maqlay isaga, wuu iga maqlay.
What she could do and what she could not.	Waxa ay qaban karto iyo waxa ay awoodi weyday.
I did not want to be at school	Ma rabin in aan dugsiga joogo
This is something new.	Tani waa wax cusub.
To say as if it were nothing.	Si aad u sheegto sida haddii aysan waxba ahayn.
Anything else.	Wax kale.
This is very interesting to me.	Tani aad bay ii xiiso badan tahay.
He said he couldn't do it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu samayn karin.
I always did the right thing	Mar walba waxaan samayn jiray wax sax ah
I think he is fine.	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiican yahay.
I still haven't left	Wali ma tagin
I know you know how it is	Waan ogahay inaad ogtahay sida ay tahay
He was another man.	Nin kale ayuu ahaa.
It can help	Way ku caawin kartaa
I do not think so	U malayn maayo
I heard her say it first	Waxaan maqlay waxay tidhi marka hore
I am really happy	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
Nothing helped	Waxba ima caawin
I wondered who he could be	Waxaan la yaabay cidda uu noqon karo
He said it was good to go now.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay wanaagsan tahay in hadda la tago.
No one likes that.	Qofna taas ma jecla.
I just can't keep it	Kaliya ma sii haysan karo
I do not know what to do	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
Me and you.	Aniga iyo adiga.
I want to know what happened to her	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa ku dhacay
Something very bad.	Wax aad u xun.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma samayn doono
But as it turned out it was good.	Laakiin sida ay ahayd way fiican tahay.
Really, I really do.	Runtii, runtii waan sameeyaa.
Good man, she said	Nin wanaagsan, sida ay tidhi
I still don't have a job	Weli shaqo maan haysan
I thought you were.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay.
I could not find much.	Wax badan ayaan ka heli waayay.
Obviously I would like to know why.	Sida cad waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sababta.
Not only that.	Kaliya lama samayn.
Apparently it was a few years.	Waxaa cad in ay ahayd dhowr sano.
Sorry to do that.	Waan ka xumahay inaan sameeyo.
It was so often.	Waxay ahayd sidaas oo kale inta badan.
I just did not know why	Kaliya maan garanayn sababta
I was not always lucky	Mar walba nasiib maan ahayn
I owe you more	Waxa aan ku leeyahay wax ka badan
He knows this.	Tan wuu garanayaa.
The same is true today.	Isla maanta waa sidaas oo kale.
I did not know that would happen	Maan ogeyn in ay taasi dhici doonto
And maybe it was.	Oo laga yaabo inay ahayd.
I really had.	Runtii waan lahaa.
He would see it again one day.	Mar kale ayuu arki lahaa maalin.
Not yet, he thought.	Weli ma aha, ayuu u maleeyay.
You are an adult.	Qof weyn baad tahay.
He has to go.	Waa inuu tago.
Somehow, he really is.	Si ahaan, runtii wuu joogaa.
I knew he would not give anything	Waan ogaa inuusan waxba siin doonin
Now she has to go home.	Hadda waa inay guriga aado.
I can help you do it if you want	Waxaan kaa caawin karaa inaad sameyso haddii aad rabto
'I !.	'I !.
Like him.	Isaga oo kale.
He thinks he is a tough guy.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inuu yahay nin adag.
I can do better than that	Waxaan samayn karaa wax ka fiican taas
We may not know, but we are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan garanayn, laakiin waan nahay.
I have an idea you like.	Waxaan hayaa fikrad aad jeceshahay.
I should not have done that	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas sameeyo
I wonder why he is here	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu halkan u joogo
I hope all is well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in dhammaan ay wanaagsan yihiin.
I need to stay here for a while	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaan sii joogo wax yar
She is happy.	Way faraxsan tahay.
He really did.	Runtii wuu galay.
The other place is in dispute.	Meesha kale waa la isku hayaa.
I thought it might come out.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay soo bixi karto.
I did not say otherwise.	Si kale uma sheegin.
I really did not want to go	Runtii ma rabin inaan tago
I really think it's worse	Runtii waxaan filayaa inay ka xun tahay
Now, this has been longer.	Hadda, tani waxay ahayd muddo ka badan.
She looks like him.	Waxay u egtahay isaga oo kale.
I need your help to find a job	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad iga caawiso inaan shaqo helo
I had to do it to see it	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo si aan u arko
There was nothing else.	Wax kale ma jirin.
Not much, but it is home.	Ma badna, laakiin waa guriga.
really, i'm so happy now !!.	run ahaantii, hadda aad ayaan u faraxsanahay!!.
I think he could be, but he is very smart	Waxaan filayaa inuu noqon karo, laakiin aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay
One is bigger.	Mid ka weyn ayaa ka weyn.
They are more likely to do it.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sameeyaan.
I just couldn't let him go	Kaliya waan u ogolaan waayay inuu baxo
I had to do nothing	Ma ahayn in aan waxba sameeyo
I hope you can enjoy it	Waxaan filayaa in aad ka heli karto
Only everything will do.	Kaliya wax walba ayaa sameyn doona.
That is money.	Taasi waa lacag.
They will stay longer.	Waxay joogi doonaan muddo dheer.
I was at every opportunity	Fursad kasta ayaan la joogay
It took a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaa qaatay.
He was right.	Wuxuu ahaa mid sax ah.
No man lives here.	Ma jiro nin halkan ku nool.
I will not leave anything out	Waxba ka tagi maayo
I wanted someone else to work with	Waxaan rabay qof kale inuu la shaqeeyo
I wanted him to stay	Waxaan rabay inuu joogo
It's great, really.	Aad bay u fiican tahay, run ahaantii.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
I did well there	Waxaan ku sameeyay si fiican halkaas
I looked at it, but saw nothing	Anigu sidaas ayaan eegay, laakiin waxba ma arag
He did one.	Mid buu sameeyay.
It can still happen to me.	Wali way igu dhici kartaa aniga.
I thought that would be nice	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd
I should have.	Waxay ahayd inaan haysto.
I heard you	waan ku maqlay
I have always been that way.	Weligay sidaas ayaan ahaan jiray.
I am the adult, not you	Anigu waxaan ahay qofka weyn, ma aha adiga
I had to find out who	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado cidda
It's hard to find later.	Way adag tahay in mar dambe la helo.
I have no idea where	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo meesha
I didn’t think it would be but it really is	Uma malaynayn inay ahaan doonto laakiin runtii waa
I felt that maybe it was.	Waxaan dareemay in laga yaabo in ay sidaas tahay.
I have a lot to tell you	Wax badan oo aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa
I told her it was good	Waxaan u sheegay inay fiican tahay
Would you like to know what you are doing.	Ma jeclaan lahayd inaad ogaato waxaad samaynayso.
I think he needs time	Waxaan filayaa inuu u baahan yahay wakhti
At work	Shaqada
I knew what would happen	Waan ogaa waxa dhici doona
I can see, clearly.	Waan arki karaa, si cad.
I really need to know	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado
He started again.	Mar kale ayuu bilaabay.
I promised.	Waxaan u ballan qaaday.
I can stay, he thought	Waan joogi karaa, ayuu is yidhi
This would be over.	Tani way dhammaan lahayd.
But it is a good place.	Laakiin waa meel wanaagsan.
Who would have thought that a few years ago.	Yaa u malayn lahaa in dhowr sano ka hor.
I didn't even get anything close.	Xitaa wax u dhow ma helin.
Maybe, maybe.	Malaha, malaha.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
I do not have to tell you that	Ma aha inaan taas kuu sheego
I can make one better for you	Mid ka fiican ayaan kuu samayn karaa
I hope I will be able to remain friends	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan awoodi doono inaan sii ahaan doono saaxiibo
You can't see anything.	Waxba ma arki kartid.
Maybe, he said.	Laga yaabaa, ayuu yidhi.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
I really know what she would say	Runtii waan garanayaa waxay odhan lahayd
I did not speak.	Maan hadlin.
I know you need to do this alone	Waan ogahay inaad u baahan tahay inaad tan keligaa samayso
At home, she did not.	Guriga, ma ay lahayn.
I am not all.	Anigu ma ihi dhammaan.
He was quick and smart.	Wuxuu ahaa mid degdeg badan oo caqli badan.
Everyone saw what happened.	Qof kastaa wuu arkay waxa dhacay.
The only way to do this is to work.	Sida kaliya ee tan lagu samayn karaa waa in la shaqeeyo.
I refused to pick it up and pick it up	Waan diiday in aan soo qaado oo aan qaado
No tonight.	Ma jiro caawa.
I know there is a man	Waan ogahay inuu jiro nin
Probably the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ugu wanaagsan.
This is to be found.	Tani waa in la helo.
How nice to do this.	Sidee u fiican in tan la sameeyo.
Maybe I want to tell him later	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan rabo inaan u sheego maalin dambe
I am with you	waan kula jiraa
I wonder what you think of the place.	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaad u malaynaysaa meesha.
And again and again.	Oo mar kale iyo mar kale.
I do not have time for that.	Waqti uma hayo taas.
No one really took it.	Qofna si dhab ah uma qaadan.
Not just food as well.	Ma aha oo kaliya cunto sidoo kale.
I will not be there one day	Hal maalin ma joogi doono halkaas
That is probably enough now.	Taasi malaha hadda waa ku filan tahay.
Good, he said.	Fiican, ayuu yidhi.
It was bad.	Wax xun bay ahayd.
She had to tell him.	Waxay ahayd inuu u sheego.
Now I will do what you want to do.	Hadda waxaan sameyn doonaa wax aad rabto inaad sameyso.
Whatever they like.	Wax kasta oo ay jecel yihiin.
I wanted to see that.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas arko.
This is obvious.	Tani waa wax iska cad.
It can’t be beautiful.	Ma noqon karo qurux.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.	Ha ii sheegin haddii aadan rabin.
I did not want to know if he was serious or not	Maan rabin inaan ogaado inuu dhab ka yahay iyo in kale
I did not know what had happened to me	Ma garanayn waxa igu dhacay
It will be fun to do.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh in la sameeyo.
He may have felt that way.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu dareemay sidaas oo kale.
He was lucky and really got it.	Nasiib buu lahaa oo runtii wuu helay.
I could not believe what I saw now	Waxaan rumaysan waayay waxa hadda arkay
This is really great.	Tani runtii waa mid aad u fiican.
I think there is someone else	Waxaan filayaa inuu jiro qof kale
In fact, he did not say.	Dhab ahaantii, ma uusan odhan.
I said something obvious	Waxaan sheegay wax iska cad
I could not do this again	Ma awoodin tan mar kale
I don't think they are real.	Uma maleynayo inay dhab yihiin.
I can see you	Waan ku arki karaa adiga
I just didn’t like it.	Kaliya maan jeclayn.
I would like you to tell me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad ii sheegto
I still haven't found him	Wali ma helin isaga
Maybe I shouldn't have been here, really	Malaha ma ahayn inaan halkaan joogo, run ahaantii
He just said nothing.	Kaliya waxba ma odhan.
I'm sure you will find someone else out there	Waxaan hubaa inaad qof kale ka heli doonto halkaas
I think that's a good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan
I thought we were all great	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan wada weyn nahay
I came out to find you.	Waxaan u soo baxay inaan ku helo.
I do not know what that was	Ma garanayo waxay taasi ahayd
I think that will happen to someone else.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in ay taasi ku dhici doonto qof kale.
I will not be able to help you with this	Ma awoodi doono inaan tan kaa caawiyo
I would do anything to take it	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta si aan u qaado
Too much time.	Waqti aad u badan.
I would like to know more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ogaado.
I really have no idea how	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto sida
That was you.	Taasi waxay ahayd adiga.
I wish, but.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa, laakiin.
I asked once	Mar ayaan waydiiyay
That's what he said, too.	Taasi waa waxa uu yidhi, sidoo kale.
it is as.	waa sidii .
That's weird, you guessed it.	Taasi waa yaab, waxaad u malaynaysaa.
Now let me tell you something.	Hadda aan wax kuu sheego.
I think you can.	Waxaan filayaa inaad dhici karto.
You don't have to want him here.	Uma baahnid inaad jeclaan lahayd inuu halkan joogo.
I seem to have done everything, too	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan wax walba sameeyay, sidoo kale
I will love you.	waan ku jeclaan doonaa.
That is better.	Taas way ka fiican tahay.
I know it's hard.	Waan ogahay inay adag tahay.
He would always make time.	Wuxuu had iyo jeer samayn lahaa waqti.
I told him he would never speak to me again.	Waxaan u sheegay in uusan mar dambe ila hadlin.
But here's what we do.	Laakiin waa kan waxa aan samayno.
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
That's right.	Waa sax.
I think this is a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
Everyone is there.	Qof kastaa wuu joogaa.
If someone has it, he should.	Haddii qof uu haysto, waa inuu.
Maybe a little better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax yar ka fiican.
Can't help.	Lama caawin karo.
If that is what you want.	Haddii taasi tahay waxa aad rabto.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
But it will be done.	Laakiin waa la qaban doonaa.
Each one.	Mid walba.
It is not time.	Ma aha waqti.
I could not go	Waan u tagi waayay
I have never seen anything like this.	Weligay ma arag sida tan.
I am very happy now	Hadda aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I just want to know how it is	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida ay tahay
But it is interesting to see.	Laakiin waa wax xiiso leh in la arko.
It must be seen by everyone.	Waa in la arkay qof walba.
I can give you everything here	Waxaan ku siin karaa wax walba halkan
I can't figure out why.	Ma awoodo in la ogaado sababta.
No one can find it.	Qofna ma heli karo.
I thought one was enough	Waxaan u maleeyay in mid ku filan yahay
You know it's me.	Waad ogtahay inay aniga tahay.
I saw what he was doing and I was quick to help	Waan arkay waxa uu samaynayo oo u degdeg inaan caawiyo
I liked it a lot, too	Wax badan ayaan ka helay, sidoo kale
Everyone is there.	Qof walba waa jiraa.
I think you did it here	Waxaan filayaa inaad halkan ku samaysay
It was like another day.	Waxay ahayd sida maalin kale.
She did not want to.	Ma ay rabin.
It is very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
You do not have to do this.	Ma aha inaad tan samaynayso.
It is a very good car.	Waa baabuur aad u fiican.
I have no idea who she is	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo cidda ay tahay
But it should not be.	Laakiin maaha inay.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
But I do not know how to do it.	Laakiin ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo.
He can leave tonight.	Caawa wuu bixi karaa.
There was no time for me.	Ma jirin waqti ay aniga ii joogin.
I have not seen what it is	Maan arag waxa ay tahay
This is probably the best way.	Tani waxay u badan tahay sida ugu wanaagsan.
I'm scared.	Waxaan ka baqayaa.
He was clear.	Wuxuu ahaa mid cad.
Really not sure.	Runtii ma hubo.
He was surprised.	Waa la yaabay.
I could not see who she was	Maan arki karin cidda ay tahay
Everyone was here.	Qof kastaa wuu joogay halkan.
I have a little for you	Wax yar baan kuu hayaa
I was not able to talk to her	Ma awoodin inaan la hadlo
I went once	Hal mar ayaan aaday
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
Probably nothing.	Malaha waxba.
And well you should not.	Oo si fiican waa inaadan.
I wonder how many people rejected it today	Waxaan la yaabay inta qof ee diiday maanta
Money, money, money.	Lacag, lacag, lacag.
I knew you would leave	Waan ogaa inaad bixi doonto
But this is a long time coming.	Laakiin tani waa muddo dheer.
I do it now	hadda waan sameeyaa
I tried it first	Waxaan isku dayay marka hore
It was really fun.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I told him to do it for me	Waxaan u sheegay inuu ii sameeyo
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
I will address three problems.	Waxaan wax ka qaban doonaa saddex dhibaato.
Everything at once.	Wax walba hal mar.
I wish it would be different	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay si kale ahaan lahayd
It is me.	Waa aniga.
Can you believe it?	Ma rumaysan kartaa
Maybe no one knows who he is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qofna uusan ogeyn cidda uu yahay.
I want to see you in a negative light	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko si xun
She said she would not allow it.	Waxay sheegtay in aysan ogolaan doonin.
I can't imagine.	Ma malayn karo.
I was here a few years later but I had to leave	Waxaan halkaan joogay dhowr sano ka dib laakiin waa inaan baxo
But it is still small.	Laakiin wali way yar tahay.
I can't give you more without taking anything from him	Wax ka badan kuma siin karo adiga oo aan isaga waxba ka qaadan
But no one knows.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo.
She is not doing it now.	Hadda ma samaynayso.
He would rather work for it.	Wuxuu ka jeclaan lahaa inuu u shaqeeyo.
He said he could not.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu awoodin.
I love you for everything.	Waxaan ku jeclahay wax walba.
I gave you something better	Wax ka fiican ayaan ku siiyay
I told you I would be friends	Waxaan kuu sheegay inaan saaxiibo noqon doono
The same is true of him.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa iska cad inaysan run isaga ahayn.
I can't say anything that hasn't been said before	Ma odhan karo wax aan hore loo sheegin
He knew very well.	Aad buu u ogaa.
I have not seen anyone leave	Maan arag qof ka baxay
good, good, good.	wanaagsan, wanaagsan, wanaagsan.
It's all me.	Dhammaan waa aniga.
Nothing less.	Wax ka yar ma jiro.
I was really surprised	Runtii aad baan ula yaabay
This is definitely true.	Tani hubaal waa sax.
But she has.	Laakiin way leedahay.
He was a bad person.	Qof xun buu ahaa.
I don’t, obviously.	Anigu ma sameeyo, si cad.
I found you and I found something beautiful	Waan ku helay oo waxaan helay wax qurux badan
I just want you to be good	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in aad wanaagsan tahay
I was not ready to know	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan ogaado
He is really happy.	Runtii aad ayuu u faraxsan yahay.
Not that it's not an interesting idea.	Ma aha in aysan ahayn fikrad xiiso leh.
I wanted her to be with me.	Waxaan rabay inay ila joogto.
I started to wonder why this is	Waxaan bilaabay in aan la yaabanahay sababta ay tani tahay
I think that is you	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay adiga
This is a problem.	Tani waa dhibaato.
I probably will always be	Waxaan u badan tahay inaan had iyo jeer ahaan doono
It was a car.	Waxa uu ahaa baabuur.
I can't take it that way	Anigu sidaas uma qaadan karo
Everything it was must have been bad.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd waa in ay ahayd mid xun.
I hope you are like that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas oo kale tahay
I will come again	mar kale ayaan iman doonaa
But he needs you.	Laakiin wuu kuu baahan yahay.
it was not wise.	caqli ma ahayn.
More than anything, he wanted to help.	Wax kasta oo ka badan, wuxuu rabay inuu caawiyo.
That was amazing	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh
It couldn't hurt me.	Waxba ima yeeli karin.
I did not know what would happen to me	Maan garanayn waxa igu dhici doona
I suspect there is a lot available	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inay jiraan wax badan oo la heli karo
He is at work.	Shaqada ayuu ku jiraa.
He never did.	Waligiis ma samayn.
I heard enough.	Waxaan maqlay in ku filan.
I want you to help me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad i caawiso.
He does it well.	Si wanaagsan ayuu u sameeyaa.
I think it is beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan tahay
This is a great place.	Tani waa meel fiican.
That was big money.	Taasi waxay ahayd lacag weyn.
I just wanted to leave.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
I hope it will take	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay qaadan doonto
I am always happy	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahay kan faraxsan
Do not take people seriously.	Dadka si dhab ah ha ugu qaadan.
I love people like that	Waxaan jeclahay dadka sidaas oo kale ah
There was someone else.	Waxaa jiray qof kale.
I know how good that would be	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u fiicnaan lahayd
They may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan haysan.
I was still trying to find out more	Waxaan weli isku dayay inaan wax badan ogaado
I don't want money.	Ma doonayo lacag.
I can't do this either	Tan sidoo kale ma qaban karo
I do not wish to remain in it	Ma jecli inaan ku sii jiro
We did not need it.	Uma baahnayn.
He wanted to make more money.	Wuxuu rabay inuu lacag badan sameeyo.
I do not know what he said	Ma garanayo wuxuu yidhi
And maybe it was, a little bit.	Oo malaha waxay ahayd, wax yar.
It was, really, the latter.	Waxay ahayd, runtii, tan dambe.
I would love to go home, too	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan aado guriga, sidoo kale
I think that is for sure	Waxay ila tahay taasi waa hubaal
Probably one man.	Hal nin bay u badan tahay.
That is a great day for us.	Taasi waa maalin nagu weyn.
I don't want it anymore	Mar dambe ma rabo
I don't see anything interesting today	Wax xiiso leh uma arko maanta
They will not be.	Ma ahaan doonaan.
It's a terrible thing.	Waa wax aad u xun.
I knew he didn't believe me	Waan ogaa inuusan i rumaysan
I think we are who we are	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan nahay cidda aan nahay
I didn't have time tonight	Caawa waqti uma helin
He is a very busy person.	Waa qof aad u badan.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
I told him he needed to come to me now	Waxaan u sheegay inuu u baahan yahay inuu hadda ii yimaado
I didn't have time to see anyone else	Waqti uma helin inaan arko qof kale
I thought, nothing really	Waxaan u maleeyay, waxba run ahaantii
Not very good at that.	Ma aha mid aad u fiican taas.
Just don't say anything.	Kaliya waxba ha odhan.
This is all true.	Tani waa run oo dhan.
Maybe he can help.	Malaha wuu caawin karaa.
I was a little rejected.	In yar baa i diiday.
Still, it is very nice and beautiful.	Weli, waa mid aad u fiican oo qurux badan.
A little here, a little there.	In yar halkan, in yar ayaa jira.
I'm sure things are clear.	Waxaan hubaa inay wax iska cad yihiin.
I don't know exactly what she is doing.	Si sax ah uma garanayo waxay samaynayso.
I think you should do it	Waxay ila tahay inaad sidaas samayso
I wonder why he does this	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu tan u sameeyo
I thought you were something else	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay wax kale
I did not know you were doing this now	Maan ogayn inaad tan samaynayso hadda
I hold everything beautifully.	Wax walba si qurux badan ayaan u hayaa.
Nice to see.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay in la arko.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo la samayn lahaa.
I heard him very well.	Aad baan u maqlay isaga.
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
I know you know that	Waan ogahay in aad taas ogtahay
There is no other way to tell.	Kaliya ma jirto si kale oo loo sheego.
Nice to see you	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko
I want to do this but I have no money	Waxaan rabaa tan inaan sameeyo laakiin lacag ma haysto
That is really nothing new.	Runtii taasi wax cusub maaha.
You may want to do this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto inaad taas sameyso.
So it was rejected.	Sidaas ayaa lagu diiday.
I just can't accept that	Kaliya taas ma ogolaan karo
It’s all together.	Waa wax walba oo wada jira.
It is too early	Waa goor hore
I would assume he did	Waxaan u qaadan lahaa inuu sameeyay
Give me a day.	Maalin i sii.
He wanted her to know he had heard.	Wuxuu rabay inay ogaato inuu maqlay.
I wanted you to know a little bit about it.	Waxaan rabay inaad wax yar ka ogaato.
he could not stop.	wuu joojin waayay.
I didn't think I would say that yesterday	Uma malaynayn in aan shalay sheego
Please give it today !.	Fadlan maanta sii!.
I wanted to eat more.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ka cuno.
I know what happened.	Waan ogahay waxa dhacay.
I have no idea how much it is	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto inta ay tahay
Now I am in a good place	Hadda waxaan joogaa meel wanaagsan
I will tell you all	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa dhammaan
Tell them you need it back.	U sheeg inaad u baahan tahay dib.
I'm sure I will.	Waan hubaa inaan sameyn doono.
I really have no idea.	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
I gave the place	Meesha ayaan siiyay
I wish I hadn’t, really	Waxaan jeclahay inaanan haysan, dhab ahaantii
I could not see him.	Maan arki karin isaga.
I know what they are, after all	Waan ogahay waxa ay yihiin, ka dib oo dhan
It is something that is not.	Waa wax aan ahayn.
Very little.	Aad uga yar.
'you'.	' ku'.
I wondered what had happened	Waxaan la yaabay maxaa dhacay
I really felt at home.	Waxaan dareemay runtii guriga.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
She said no one was at home.	Waxay sheegtay in guriga qofna uusan joogin.
I think no one wants to	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qofna uusan rabin
I was told that maybe you could help	Waxaa la ii sheegay in laga yaabo in aad caawin karto
No matter how big they are.	Si kasta oo ay u weyn yihiin.
But not too close.	Laakiin aad uma dhow.
We would talk.	Waan wada hadli lahayn.
I really couldn’t say much	Runtii wax badan uma sheegi karin
I wanted him to be with me	Waxaan rabay inuu ila joogo
He is a tall man.	Waa nin dheer.
I just can't leave him	Kaliya kama tagi karo isaga
Like many things.	Sida waxyaabo badan.
I wonder if you would like it	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aad jeclaan lahayd
After a while he got what he wanted.	Wax yar ka dib waxa uu helay waxa uu rabay.
It wasn't much work, really.	Ma ahayn shaqo badan, runtii.
I heard what happened	Waxaan maqlay waxa dhacay
Here, I will discuss that.	Halkan, waxaan ka hadli doonaa taas.
I wanted to know more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ogaado
Really need to go !!!.	Runtii u baahan in la tago!!!.
Hold on.	Qabo.
I thought it was him	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu yahay isaga
Tell them enough is enough.	U sheeg in kugu filan ayaa kugu filan.
No one went.	Qofna ma tagin.
Maybe everyone else can see it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof kasta oo kale arki karo.
I'm sure he is fine	Waan hubaa inuu fiican yahay
Maybe this is true as well.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax tahay tan sidoo kale.
I'm sure it's nothing	Waxaan hubaa inaysan waxba ahayn
Maybe that was it.	Malaha taasi waxay ahayd.
This could be you.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa adiga.
You should be happy with that.	Waa inaad ku faraxsan tahay taas.
Nothing will happen.	Wax dhici doona ma jirin.
Tell me so.	Aniga sidaas ii sheeg.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
That should be sufficient enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I still tried to help	Weli waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo
Someone else wants it.	Qof kale ayaa doona.
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
I know him.	waan garanayaa isaga.
I heard about it yesterday	Shalay ayaan ka maqlay
I desperately need a job	Waxaan aad ugu baahanahay shaqo
And you do not want to do that.	Oo ma rabto inaad taas samayso.
Very little.	Wax aad u yar.
Bad day.	Maalin xun.
I can pay you	Waan ku bixin karaa
There are no problems.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan.
I was very good.	Aad ayaan u fiicnaan jiray.
I did that once	Taas hal mar ayaan sameeyay
I want to see more of you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko wax badan
I decided not to	Waxaan go'aansaday in aanay noqon
It was without.	Waxay ahayd mid la'aan.
I just want to be.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo.
I'm happy so far	Waan ku faraxsanahay ilaa hadda
I really saw it that way	Runtii sidaas ayaan ku arkay
Turns out, not too much.	Soo baxay, aan aad u badan.
I tried to find out	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado
I have something to tell you.	wax aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa.
I can't find the place.	Ma heli karo meesha.
I think it was three	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd saddex
I know that very well	Aad ayaan u ogahay taas
There really is no.	Runtii ma jirto.
I thought that was interesting	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay tahay mid xiiso leh
I was in it for a while.	Waqti yar ayaan ku jiray.
I told you one day	Maalin baan kuu sheegay
I do not know how it was	Ma garanayo sida ay ahayd
I just felt what you wanted	Kaliya waxaan dareemay waxaad rabto
It is the smallest.	Waa kan ugu yar.
I had to get a job	Waxay ahayd in aan shaqo helo
He is another man.	Waa nin kale.
I love it, really	Waan jeclahay, run ahaantii
A lot has happened.	Wax badan ayaa dhacay.
I will not lie to you.	Been kuu sheegi maayo.
You're sorry about that.	Waad ka xun tahay taas.
I hope you have good luck	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu nasiib wanaagsan ku heli doono
I thought it was very difficult	Waxaan mooday inay aad u adag tahay
I thought you were someone else	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay qof kale
he said.	ayuu yiri.
This is unlikely to happen.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaysan dhici doonin.
This must be done.	Tani waa in la sameeyaa.
I would definitely be here again.	Waxaan hubaal ahaan lahaa halkan mar kale.
She can't take anything else.	Wax kale ma qaadan karto.
Do not say anything.	Waxba ha odhan.
Good idea.	Fikrad fiican.
I can't believe I can't do anything about it	Ma rumaysan karo inaanan waxba ka qaban karin
But he probably won't.	Laakiin waxay u badan tahay inuusan yeeli doonin.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
I can't find it that way	Kuma heli karo sidaas
They do what they do.	Waxay sameeyaan waxay sameeyaan.
I think it is the best.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay tan ugu fiican.
I had to find out how it is	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado sida uu yahay
I really know what he does	Runtii waan garanayaa waxa uu sameeyo
I can't lie	Been uma sheegi karo
I will not lie about that	Taas been ka sheegi maayo
Not worse.	Ma aha wax ka xun.
I told him what was there	Waxaan u sheegay waxa jira
Maybe he was surprised.	Malaha wuu yaabay.
I just say.	Kaliya waxaan leeyahay.
I did something today	Wax baan sameeyay maanta
They live in it.	Way ku nool yihiin.
I always have to work	Had iyo jeer waa inaan shaqeeyo
I didn't think she could do that	Uma malaynayn inay taas samayn karto
I want to know what she wants	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxay rabto
If he had to go back and tell him.	Haddii uu dib ugu noqon lahaa oo u sheegi lahaa.
I just gave it a go	Kaliya waan siiyay
I could not leave	Meesha ayaan uga tagi waayay
Bad for us.	Nagu xun.
Bigger and better.	Ka weyn oo ka wanaagsan.
Now, tell me.	Hadda, ii sheeg.
I'm sorry for him	Waan ka xumahay isaga
That would go first, really.	Taasi way tagi lahayd marka hore, runtii.
Someone else posted	Qof kale ayaa dhigay
I can't believe that	Ma rumaysan karo taas
I'm just happy to do it	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay in la sameeyo
It's not very beautiful, you know.	Aad uma qurux badna, waad ogtahay.
I have not been there for a while	In muddo ah ma aan joogin halkaas
I was a little surprised	Waan yara yaabay
He asked me not to stop.	Wuxuu iga codsaday inaanan joojin.
said nothing	waxba ma odhan
It must have been a terrible thing for you.	Waxay ahayd inay kugu ahayd wax aad u xun.
It's beautiful.	Waa qurux badan.
Good for you.	Adiga kuu wanaagsan.
But still one.	Laakiin weli mid.
I tried the door.	Waxaan isku dayay albaabka.
He felt he was somewhere else, everywhere but here.	Wuxuu dareemay inuu meel kale joogo, meel kasta laakiin halkan.
I have no idea where to go	Meel ay aadi lahayd maan fikrad ka haysan
That is exactly what it was.	Taasi waa dhab waxa ay ahayd.
She could not see anything.	Waxba ma ay arki karin.
Spend one day here, spend one day.	Hal maalin ku bixi halkan, hal maalin ku qaado.
I think it could come back	Waxaan filayaa inay soo noqon karto
I think this is what is good for everyone	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay waxa qof walba u wanaagsan
I could not get out, really	Waan ka bixi waayay, runtii
I tried to do something	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax sameeyo
I have both seen and heard	Labaduba wax baan arkay oo maqlay
An old one.	Mid hore.
I would like him to say something, whatever	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu wax sheego, wax kasta
He would not take it.	Ma uu qaadan lahaa.
And he does it beautifully.	Oo si qurux badan ayuu u sameeyaa.
I have seen enough.	Wax igu filan baan arkay.
I think it is something else	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax kale
I can do everything here	Wax walba halkan ayaan ku samayn karaa
I don't know if it's right or not.	Ma garanayo inay sax tahay iyo in kale.
I really should have seen the following	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan arko soo socda
He tried another.	Mid kale ayuu isku dayay.
What did you say.	Maxaad tidhi.
I thought it was weird	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay tahay wax yaab leh
Maybe it's just.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waxa kaliya.
A few years.	Dhowr sano.
I did not know what he said	Maan garanayn waxa uu yidhi
It really wouldn’t make him to be seen here.	Runtii ma yeeli doonto isaga in halkan lagu arko.
I saw who she really was	Waxaan u arkay qofka ay dhab ahaantii tahay
I saw and there are three	Waan arkay oo waxaa jira saddex
I used to be beautiful	Hore ayaan si qurux badan u ahaan jiray
That is just one meal.	Taasi waa hal cunto oo kaliya.
I think she would do that.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas samayn lahayd.
Where it will definitely be found.	Meesha hubaal laga heli doono.
I did not make time	Waqti kuma aan samayn
But something else.	Laakiin wax kale.
I did not do that	Taas maan samayn
No one had more.	Qofna wax ka badan ma haysan.
Maybe you like it tonight	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad jeceshahay caawa
Both have not spoken for several years.	Labaduba dhowr sano ma hadlin.
I used to be.	Waxaan ahaan jiray.
It has already been done for me.	Mar hore ayaa la ii sameeyay.
I did not want to see	Maan rabin inaan arko
He said he wanted to leave.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu doonayo inuu baxo.
I have never seen him before	Hadda ka hor weligay ma arag
I did not know they were alive	Maan garanayn inay nool yihiin
And it doesn't matter.	Oo waxba maaha.
I can leave	Waan ka bixi karaa
He looked interesting.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid xiiso leh.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
You have done this to us.	Waxaad nagu samaysay tan.
I didn't even do it one day	Xitaa hal maalin maan samayn
She did.	Way samaysay.
I'm glad to have you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku haysto.
He said he could not believe it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu rumaysan karin.
I was surprised it was now permanent	Waxaan la yaabay inay hadda joogto tahay
He is a very handsome man.	Waa nin aad u qurux badan.
I know, they are many.	Waan ogahay, inay badan yihiin.
I really like him	Runtii waan jeclahay isaga
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
I had to say something about it	Waxay ahayd inaan wax ka sheego
I would do it again and again	Mar kale iyo mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa
I have always been that way	Weligay sidaas ayaan ahaan jiray
This is not over yet.	Tani weli ma dhammaan.
I think we can help	Waxaan filayaa inaan ku caawin karno
I can't give you everything	Wax walba kuma siin karo
There was nothing for him there.	Ma jirin wax isaga halkaas.
And, whatever it is, it is smart.	Oo, wax kasta oo ay tahay, waa caqli.
At first she didn't want to.	Markii hore ma ay rabin.
I want to see what it looks like	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko sida ay u egtahay
I can't do everything.	Wax walba ma samayn karo.
I had something else	Wax kale ayaan lahaa
This was new to me	Tani waxay igu ahayd mid igu cusub
Not much.	Ma badna.
There were three others with him.	Waxaa isaga la joogay saddex kale.
I do not have long	Ma haysto wakhti dheer
This is what happened here.	Tani waa waxa halkan ka dhacay.
And less.	Iyo wax ka yar.
He appeared at the door.	Wuxuu ka soo muuqday albaabka.
You are new to this.	Waad ku cusub tahay kan.
If someone could give it to me that would be great.	Haddii qof uu i siin karo taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I will not do that here.	Taas halkan kuma samayn doono.
That is here.	Taasi waa halkan.
It is truly a beautiful place for this.	Runtii waa meel qurux badan tan.
You can do this wherever you want.	Waxaad sidaas samayn kartaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
She lost.	Way wayday.
You have been paid.	Lacag ayaa lagu siiyay.
I may not have much time	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan haysan waqti badan
Give us something good.	Wax wanaagsan na sii.
I knew she would be there	Waxaan ogaa inay halkaas joogi doonto
But I do not know why.	Laakiin ma garanayo sababta.
I think he knows what he is doing	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu garanayo wuxuu samaynayo
There is a lot of good stuff to work on here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan oo lagu shaqeeyo halkan.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
But it would be better.	Laakiin way fiicnaan lahayd.
If so, great.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, weyn.
We will get it first	Marka hore waan heli doonaa
I think she did.	Waxaan filayaa inay samaysay.
Do not let them do this to you.	Ha u ogolaan inay sidaas kugu sameeyaan.
So far, no luck.	Ilaa hadda, nasiib ma leh.
He came out, he went out.	Wuu soo baxay, wuu baxay.
Only one day.	Kaliya hal maalin.
One to talk would be nice	Mid lagu hadlo ayaa fiicnaan lahayd
Stop.	Jooji.
What they cannot see is that it is not the same.	Waxa aanay arki karin waa in aanay ahayn wax la mid ah.
I am happy today	Waan ku faraxsanahay maanta
I did not get much	Wax badan maan helin
That may be true.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay run tahay.
I'm not looking to get it again	Uma eka in aan mar kale helo
No one.	Qofna maaha.
More than you know.	In ka badan inta aad ogtahay.
I will not say anything about it	Waxba ka odhan maayo
Someone would talk.	Qof ayaa hadli lahaa.
I took one and took a little.	Mid baan qaatay oo yara qaatay.
It turned out.	Waxaa soo baxay.
I do not expect to be an adult	Ma rajaynayo inaan noqdo qof weyn
Not like him.	Ma aha isaga oo kale.
It is really great for us.	Dhab ahaantii way nagu weyn tahay.
I know what he knows	Waan ogahay waxa uu yaqaan
She had no idea what to expect.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan waxa ay filan karto.
I will not leave everything to you	Wax walba adiga keligaa uga tagi maayo
There is nothing worse than this.	Ma jiro wax ka xun tan.
I knew it all	Taas oo dhan waan ogaa
I like to know a little bit about people	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax yar ka ogaado dadka
I make something to eat	Waxaan sameeyaa wax aan cuno
It was really taken.	Runtii waa la qaaday.
But you know.	Laakiin waad ogtahay.
I hope he becomes a good man.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu noqday nin wanaagsan.
I think it was reversed	Waxaan u malayn lahaa in laga noqday
That really was it.	Runtii taasi waxay ahayd.
He told her not to say anything about what had happened.	Waxa uu u sheegay in aanay waxba ka odhan waxa dhacay.
I need to do things	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo waxyaabo
I don't know what to do, either.	Waxaan sameeyo ma garanayo, sidoo kale.
It did not take long to do.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer in la sameeyo.
He knew it would happen soon.	Wuu ogaa inay dhawaan dhici doonto.
This is rejected.	Tani waa la diiday.
I can't see there is a problem	Ma arki karo inay dhibaato jirto
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
I have to be there now	Waa inaan halkaas joogo hadda
Not much.	Wax badan kuma jiraan.
I think he went there	Waxaan u malaynayaa in uu halkaas tagay
I can be so	Waxaan noqon karaa sidaas
I decided	Aniga ayaa go’aansaday
But I will go.	Laakiin waan tagi doonaa.
He knew she was coming.	Wuu ogaa inay iman doonto.
There is nothing good.	Wax wanaagsan ma jiraan.
He took money.	Lacag buu qaatay.
It was done quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaa loo sameeyay.
I should not have talked about it	Ma ahayn inaan ka hadlo
I need to know he is still here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inuu weli halkan joogo
I would leave	Waan ka bixi lahaa
I haven't seen him in a long time	Muddo dheer kuma arag
Often this is a big deal.	Inta badan tani waa wax weyn.
In fact, there is nothing to do.	Dhab ahaantii, ma jiraan wax la sameeyo.
I put it off.	Dib baan u dhigay.
It was him.	Waxay ahayd isaga.
I know you will be fine	Waan ogahay inaad fiicnaan doonto
I think it would be good for me	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ii fiicnaan lahayd
And there is more.	Oo waxaa jira wax ka badan.
I think it would be me	Waxaan qabaa inay aniga ahaan lahayd
But that is also smart.	Laakiin taasi sidoo kale waa caqli badan.
I thought he loved you	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku jecel yahay
I was really impressed	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay
It will be a very beautiful day for you.	Waxay kuu noqon doontaa maalin aad u qurux badan.
What I do not really know.	Waxa aan dhab ahaan garanayn.
Not just me.	Ma aha aniga oo kaliya.
Probably not everything.	Malaha wax walba maaha.
I didn't get a job today	Wax shaqo ah maan helin maanta
He was not in the room.	Ma uusan joogin qolka.
I think you can go now	Waxaan filayaa inaad hadda aadi karto
I can see you	Waan ku arki karaa adiga
You don't want to help me.	Ma rabto inaad i caawiso.
I can't speak right now	Hadda kama hadli karo
I haven't seen him in a while.	In muddo ah ma arag isaga.
I really can't imagine	Runtii ma malayn karo
Definitely a bit.	Dhab ahaantii xoogaa.
He did not want the place.	Meesha ma uu rabin.
If true, he did not own a car.	Haddii ay run tahay, ma uu lahayn baabuur.
I have never seen a time that was not	Weligay ma arag wakhti aanay ahayn
I wonder how much he heard.	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta uu maqlay.
She found out later.	Waxay ogaatay goor dambe.
I will not leave here	Halkan ka tagi maayo
I had to work fast, let me tell you	Waxay ahayd inaan si degdeg ah u shaqeeyo, aan kuu sheego
I will not do that again	Taas mar dambe ma samaynayo
You think they will, but they don't.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inay samayn doonaan, laakiin ma sameeyaan.
I love it, really.	Jeclahay, runtii.
When done well.	Marka si fiican loo sameeyo.
Where everyone knows everyone else.	Meesha qof kastaa yaqaan qof kasta oo kale.
Not so anymore.	Ma aha sidaas mar dambe.
He was very impressed.	Aad buu ula dhacay.
For a long time.	Waqti dheer.
Probably the same here.	Malaha halkan waa isku mid.
I got a lot	Waxaan helay wax badan
He was a great man.	Waxa uu ahaa nin weyn.
I could not see very well	Si fiican wax uma arki karin
Now I can see a lot	Hadda aad ayaan u arki karaa
A lot of bad things happened to him.	Wax badan oo xun ayaa ku dhacay.
I wanted to help now	Waxaan rabay inaan hadda caawiyo
I wanted to keep that.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas sii hayo.
I love the place	waan jeclahay meesha
I liked that, he said.	Waan ka helay taas, ayuu yidhi.
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
No one knows what happened, exactly.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa dhacay, si sax ah.
It can be stopped.	Waa la joojin karaa.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I wonder if you can help me	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aad i caawin karto
I can't do anything.	Waxba ma awoodo.
I hope it was good	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ahayd mid wanaagsan
He has been there for a long time.	Muddo dheer ayuu halkaas joogay.
I know you can do the job	Waan ogahay inaad shaqada qaban karto
I want someone to know	Waxaan rabaa in qof ogaado
Know me.	Iga yaqaan.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
Lots of friends.	Saaxiibo badan.
I was always ready	Mar walba waan diyaar ahaa
I thought he knew what you did.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu garanayo waxaad samaysay.
Always a little more.	Mar kasta wax yar ka badan.
I still can't.	Wali ma awoodo.
I love learning new things	Waxaan jeclahay inaan barto waxyaabo cusub
I am one of them.	Aniga ayaa ka mid ah.
I can't help much	Wax badan kuma caawin karo
That sounds complicated.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid adag.
Now they have to do it.	Hadda waa inay sameeyaan.
One, you said.	Mid ka mid ah, waxaad tidhi.
Download soon	Soo bixi dhawaan
I have been, until recently	Waxaan ahaan jiray, ilaa dhawaan
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
I did what he did.	Waxaan sameeyay wixii uu sameeyay.
It won't take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan doonto.
If you do not want to.	Haddii aadan rabin.
I promised not to tell anyone.	Waxaan u ballan qaaday in aanan cidna u sheegin.
I have nothing to do today	Wax aan sameeyo maanta ma hayo
It will not do.	Ma yeeli doonto.
I wanted to help him	Waxa aan rabay in aan caawiyo isaga
Only that.	Kaliya waa in.
We would be fine	Waan fiicnaan lahayn
In fact, there is not much to say.	Dhab ahaantii, ma jiraan wax badan oo la sheego.
I had no real friends	Maan lahayn saaxiibo dhab ah
But he knew it could not happen.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inaysan dhici karin.
I know they need me.	Waan ogahay inay ii baahan yihiin.
I need to speak first	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadlo marka hore
I told you	Adiga ayaan u sheegay
you would have already left	mar hore waad bixi lahayd
And stop me from doing anything that is not right.	Oo iga jooji wax kasta oo aan sax ahayn.
You	Adiga
This is a busy time for me.	Tani waa wakhti mashquul ah aniga.
I really need it.	Runtii waan u baahanahay.
I did not have much for him.	Wax badan maan lahayn isaga.
I love doing a lot of fun and new things	Waxaan jeclahay samaynta waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh oo cusub
I have already told everyone this	Mar hore ayaan qof walba u sheegay tan
I do not want to speak now.	Ma rabo inaan hadda hadlo.
I am mostly happy	Inta badan waan ku faraxsanahay
I could not find it	Waan heli waayay
I just did not understand	Kaliya ma fahmin
More than a bit.	In ka badan xoogaa.
I wanted to learn more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax ka barto
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
I have never seen it	Weligay ma arag
You know it isn't.	Waad ogtahay inuusan ahayn.
I really did nothing, I went to school	Runtii waxba maan samayn, waxaan aaday dugsiga
It would be nice to do so.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in sidaas la sameeyo.
I can't believe you did it here	Ma rumaysan karo inaad halkan ku samaysay
I had a friend, a friend	Waxaan lahaa saaxiib, saaxiib
I made him leave the house.	Waxaan ka dhigay inuu guriga ka baxo.
More time for that.	Waqti badan taas.
he could not stop.	wuu joojin waayay.
I am nobody.	Anigu qofna ma ihi.
It didn’t help that he didn’t really like people.	Ma aysan caawin in uusan runtii jeclayn dadka.
I want this to be done in advance	Waxaan rabaa in tan hore loo sameeyo
Three years ago.	Saddex sano ka hor.
And well known.	Oo si fiican loo yaqaan.
I do not know where you went	Meel aad aaday maan garanayn
I always do it in a new place	Had iyo jeer waxaan ku sameeyaa meel cusub
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
He is there.	Halkaas ayuu joogaa.
I could not stay here.	Halkan ma joogi karin.
You have to stay with it.	Waa inaad la joogto.
I do not want to stay here	Ma doonayo inaan halkaan sii joogo
Really, I really wanted to	Runtii, runtii waan rabay
I can see that here.	Waxaan taas ka arki karaa halkan.
Maybe it was the same.	Malaha waxay ahayd mid la mid ah.
I wanted to tell you	Waxaan rabay inaan kuu sheego
It would have taken a long time.	Waxa uu qaadan lahaa wakhti dheer ka hor.
A little better	Wax yar ka wanaagsan
He always said.	Had iyo jeer wuu odhan jiray.
I am very sorry about that	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
I also looked at the door.	Albaabka ayaan sidoo kale eegay.
It’s a lot together.	Waa wax badan oo wada jira.
I was nothing	Waxba maan ahayn
It was a difficult day for us.	Waxay noo ahayd maalin adag.
I had to do that before anything else	Waxay ahayd in aan taas ka hor wax kale ka hor
I know who you are	Waan garanayaa qofka aad tahay
He started telling me who he was, what he had done.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu ii sheego qofka uu yahay, waxa uu sameeyay.
I had nothing to do	Ma haysan wax aan sameeyo
They are who they are.	Waa cidda ay yihiin.
I will not really tell you	Dhab ahaan kuu sheegi maayo
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
I can do everything here	Waxaan wax walba ku samayn karaa halkan
I thought maybe for a while.	Waxaan u maleeyay in laga yaabo in ay muddo ah.
And the other, too, now.	Iyo kan kale, sidoo kale, hadda.
It belongs to one man.	Hal nin baa leh.
He could not see.	Wuu arki waayay.
I have not seen it before	Maan arag markii hore
This is not true	Tani run maaha
Made and made.	La sameeyay oo la sameeyay.
I could not find anything to eat	Wax aan cuno ma helin
I really wonder how that is true.	Runtii waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay taasi run u tahay.
Don't be like me.	Ha noqon aniga oo kale.
I looked again.	Mar kale ayaan eegay.
Not sure more.	Ma hubo in ka badan.
I have no idea what this might be	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxa ay tani noqon karto
I had to leave.	Waxay ahayd inaan ka baxo.
I had to leave there	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas uga tago
I knew about everyone	Qof walba waan ka ogaa
I know it's true	Waan ogahay inay run tahay
He did the same for her.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayuu u sameeyay.
I did not have time for this	Waqti uma helin tan
Maybe he was.	Waa laga yaabaa inuu ahaa.
I wonder what it looks like	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay u egtahay
They did not have it.	Ma ay haysan.
I look forward to seeing you one day	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan maalin arko
I was once one	Mar ayaan ka mid ahaa
She can do whatever she wants.	Waxay doonto way samayn kartaa.
Beautiful day.	Maalin qurux badan.
I always have a lot to do.	Had iyo jeer waxaan hayaa waxyaabo badan oo aan sameeyo.
Better than anyone else.	Qof kasta oo kale ka wanaagsan.
I used to be beautiful	Waxaan ahaan jiray qurux
I should not have been there	Ma ahayn in aan halkaas joogo
That can be difficult for him.	Taasi waxay dhib ku noqon kartaa isaga.
No one has ever done that before.	Qofna hore uma samayn taas.
Great one.	Mid weyn.
And you still think it's a good idea.	Oo waxaad weli u malaynaysaa inay tahay fikrad fiican.
He told me he would stop.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in uu joojin doono.
No one knew much about him.	Qofna wax badan kama ogayn isaga.
You will find this.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa tan.
This is the back of the new home.	Tani waa dambe ee guriga cusub.
After a while she would allow it.	Wax yar ka dib way u ogolaan lahayd.
I started to help myself	Waxaan bilaabay inaan is caawiyo
I am here with you	halkaan ayaan kula joogaa
I hope it will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
Everyone is everyone.	Qof walba waa qof walba.
I think he is in me	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu igu jiro
Pick it up now.	Hadda soo qaado.
I can't tell you	Ma awoodi karo inaan kuu sheego
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Ilaa hadda ma jirto.
Me and you.	Aniga iyo adiga.
Here it is the same as anywhere else.	Halkan waa la mid sida meel kasta oo kale.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
The rest do not.	Inta kale oo aan lahayn.
I don't know if he will pay again.	Ma garanayo inuu mar kale bixin doono iyo in kale.
Now, it is not available now.	Hadda, hadda lama helin.
Yesterday it was a common place.	Shalay waxay ahayd meel la wada leeyahay.
I had to do it a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo wakhti dheer ka hor.
I wanted to talk to him	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo
To have.	Si uu u lahaa.
It would all be fine.	Dhammaan way fiicnaan lahayd.
I can't do this again	Mar kale tan ma samayn karo
I think it is correct	Waxaan filayaa inay sax tahay
He was surprised.	Waa la yaabay.
I had a similar idea	Waxaan lahaa fikrad la mid ah
Whatever he would expect, this is not.	Wax kasta oo uu filan lahaa, tani maaha.
I did not know what it was	Maan garanayn waxa ay tahay
I'm afraid it's real.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay dhab tahay.
I knew.	Waan ogaa.
I thought now everyone knew	Waxaan u maleeyay in hadda qof kastaa ogaa
But you will come back.	Laakiin waad soo noqon doontaa.
Probably not.	Malaha ma haysan.
Soon we would be home.	Mar dhow waxaan noqon lahayn guriga.
I really don't get this.	Runtii tan ma helo.
There was nothing else I could do	Wax kale oo aan sameeyo ma jirin
I must.	waa inaan.
Much the same tomorrow.	In badan oo la mid ah berrito.
There was no problem.	Meesha dhib ma lahayn.
He is a tall man.	Waa nin dheer.
It didn't even take long.	Xitaa waqti dheer ma qaadan.
I love you so much for doing that.	Aad ayaan kuu jeclahay inaad taas sameyso.
But it can happen.	Laakiin way dhici kartaa.
There are other things in it, too.	Waxyaabo kale ayaa ku jira, sidoo kale.
I think people like it.	Waxaan filayaa inay dadka jeceshahay.
That is better than nothing.	Taasi waa ka fiican tahay waxba.
I am something else as well	Anigu waxaan ahay waxyaabo kale sidoo kale
It was so much fun.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xiiso badan.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
What happened and what can be done about it.	Maxaa dhacay iyo waxa laga qaban karo.
I need to not know what someone is feeling.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaanan garanayn waxa uu qof dareemayo.
It really is work.	Runtii waa shaqo.
Now it is.	Hadda waa.
It needs to be worked on.	Waxaa loo baahan yahay in laga shaqeeyo.
I would be ready for him	diyaar baan u ahaan lahaa isaga
I had a very good idea of ​​who she was	Waxaan lahaa fikrad aad u wanaagsan cidda ay tahay
I began to know something	Waxaan bilaabay inaan wax ogaado
I wanted to know more about you	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan kaa ogaado
I can give you anything you want, you know	Waan ku siin karaa wax kasta oo aad rabto, waad ogtahay
I never did	Weligay ma samayn
But when he did, he went in together.	Laakiin markii uu sameeyay, wuu wada galay.
I hope to see you there !!.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkaas!!.
I think there is more to it	Waxaan filayaa inay wax badan ka jiraan
He doesn’t have to have anything better to do.	Ma aha in uu haysto wax ka fiican oo uu sameeyo.
Give it time.	Waqti sii.
I asked to see the room.	Waxaan codsaday inaan arko qolka.
I can talk to him and everything	Isaga iyo wax walba waan la hadli karaa
I know it's not true	Waxa aan ogahay in aanay run ahayn
But he did not come.	Laakiin ma uu iman.
I can hardly believe it	Si dhib ah ayaan u rumaysan karaa
It was not such a bad place.	Ma ahayn meel sidaas u xun.
I can't stay here	Halkan kuma joogi karo
Either way it is good for me.	Si kasta oo loo sameeyo waa ii fiican aniga.
And it's still better than nothing.	Oo weli way ka fiican tahay waxba.
She really didn't want to do that.	Runtii ma ay rabin inay taas samayso.
You can get out of this.	Waad ka bixi kartaa tan.
There was no problem.	Dhib ma jirin.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay
I wanted you to know that.	Waxaan rabay inaad taas ogaato.
I need to know how things are with him lying	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida wax isaga la jira been
I really want to do what is good	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxa wanaagsan
It would not hurt him.	Waxba uma yeeli lahayn isaga.
There is more.	Wax ka badan ayaa jira.
No one else has spent time in the same way.	Ma jiro qof kale oo waqti ku qaatay si la mid ah.
But he did not believe me.	Laakiin ima uu rumaysan.
It was very difficult.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u dhib badan.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I don't want it anymore	Mar dambe ma doonayo
Really, really he said.	Runtii, run ahaantii wuu yidhi.
This cannot be stopped.	Tan lama joojin karo.
Probably everything, he thought.	Malaha wax walba, ayuu u maleeyay.
I still think this is better	Weli waxaan qabaa in tani ay ka fiican tahay
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
I still haven't found it	Wali maan helin
He is in a very difficult place.	Meel aad u adag ayuu joogaa.
I was surprised by that	Taas waan la yaabay
I put it there	Halkaas ayaan dhigay
I would like to do something	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax sameeyo
I found something more interesting.	Waxaan helay wax ka xiiso badan.
This should not be too difficult.	Tani waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
There is no time, there is nothing beautiful.	Ma jiro waqti, ma jiraan wax qurux badan.
It can be done, for sure.	Waa la samayn karaa, hubaal.
tell me what to do.	ii sheeg waxa aan sameeyo.
And it is good.	Oo waa wanaagsan yahay.
I'm not sure what happened there.	Ma hubo waxa halkaas ka dhacay.
You know, you know.	Waad ogtahay, waad ogtahay.
I really have to be here tonight	Runtii waa inaan caawa halkan joogo
I would like to.	Waan jeclaan lahaa.
I thought she wanted that	Waxaan u maleeyay inay sidaas ku rabto
I used to go every day.	Maalin walba waan tagi jiray.
Now that is the worst.	Hadda taasi waa tan ugu xun.
We need something good in advance	Waxaan u baahanahay wax wanaagsan ka hor
I know him	Waan garanayaa isaga
Now they love it.	Hadda way jecel yihiin.
I can't believe you did this to me	Ma rumaysan karo inaad tan ii samaysay
I have never seen this before	Weligay tan hore uma arag
I did not know it was very bad	Ma aan ogeyn inay aad u xun tahay
Bad place to be.	Meel xun oo la joogo.
This will help.	Tani way ku caawin doontaa.
Both are.	Labaduba waa.
I can't see this.	Ma arki karo tan.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
I had a good friend	Waxaan lahaa saaxiib fiican
I could not get a chance anymore.	Mar dambe maan fursad u heli karin.
Another man came out.	Nin kale ayaa soo baxay.
I know that is hard for you	Waan ogahay inay taasi kugu adag tahay
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I hope something good	Waxaan rajeynayaa wax wanaagsan
I could not speak, I just looked.	Ma aan hadli karin, kaliya ayaan eegay.
I could not tell anyone	Qofna uma sheegi karin
It is good otherwise.	Way ku fiican tahay haddii kale.
I never feel like doing that.	Weligay ma dareemayo inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I did not want to know who he was	Maan rabin inaan ogaado qofka uu yahay
I can't think of how you can help me	Ma malayn karo sida aad ii caawin karto
I did not want to leave.	Maan rabin inaan ka tago.
Just money.	Oo kaliya lacag.
I really thought it was great.	Waxaan runtii mooday inay aad u fiican tahay.
I really need to get some work done	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo xoogaa shaqo ah
If you want to help, you can say it from there.	Haddii aad rabto inaad caawiso, halkaas ayaad ka odhan kartaa.
I know what will happen to him	Waan ogahay waxa isaga ku dhici doona
It should not have.	Ma ahayn inay.
I have to.	Waa inaan aniga ahay.
I want to go out and see myself	Waxaan rabaa inaan baxo oo aan is arko
I hope you can enjoy it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ka heli karto
It no longer looks the same.	Mar dambe isku mid uma eka.
It didn't take long.	Waqti badan ma aysan wada qaadan.
I did not want to do it again	Ma rabin inaan mar kale sameeyo
I hope to see you tomorrow	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko berrito
Both were rejected.	Labaduba waa la diiday.
I did not go to do it	Uma aan tagin inaan sameeyo
I think it has always been a bit of a problem	Waxaan filayaa inuu had iyo jeer ahaa xoogaa dhibaato ah
I was only for him	Isaga kaliya ayaan u jiray
It was a long day.	Maalin dheer bay ahayd.
This was familiar.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la yaqaan.
I'm sorry to say they are true	Waan ka xumahay inaan sheego inay run yihiin
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
I need to know that you need me.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inaad ii baahan tahay.
I just want to go there	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas tago
I decided not to tell him	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan isaga u sheegin
I took it really well	Runtii si fiican ayaan u qaatay
can you do that for me ?.	ma ii qaban kartaa taas?.
I would be someone else for him.	Waxaan noqon lahaa qof kale isaga.
And really, it could be one of us.	Oo runtii, waxay noqon kartaa mid naga mid ah.
Nothing similar has happened there.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah oo halkaas ka dhacay.
He is a beautiful person.	Waa qof qurux badan.
I did not do that.	Taas maan samayn.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo.
Above all.	In ka badan oo dhan.
That is not a given.	Taasi maaha wax la siiyay.
But so far, very good.	Laakiin ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan.
Everyone who lives does it.	Qof kasta oo nool wuu sameeyaa.
I wanted to leave here immediately	Waxaan rabay inaan si degdeg ah halkan uga tago
I saw it shortly after	Wax yar ka dib ayaan arkay
I wanted to see you	Waxaan rabay inaan ku arko
This is not a new idea right now.	Tani hadda ma ahan fikrad cusub.
You know that is not true.	Waad ogtahay in taasi aysan run ahayn.
I told you yesterday	Shalay ayaan kuu sheegay
I looked right	Sax baan u eegay
Both are the best.	Labaduba waa ugu fiican yihiin.
It should not be discussed.	Waa in aan laga hadlin.
I can see how problematic that is	Waan arki karaa sida ay taasi dhibaato u tahay
I want to find a good and beautiful man	Waxaan rabaa inaan helo nin wanaagsan oo qurux badan
He found himself in great trouble.	Dhib weyn buu isku arkay.
I can't tell you enough.	Wax kugu filan igama sheegi karo.
I will be better.	Waan ka fiicnaan doonaa.
I know what she wants	Waan ogahay waxay rabto
I knew they included a lot	Waan ogaa in ay wax badan ku jiraan
I knew it was something	Waan ogaa inay wax ahayd
But this is hard to see.	Laakiin tani way adag tahay in la arko.
Any time.	Waqti kasta.
He thought it was the best place to find it.	Wuxuu mooday inay tahay meesha ugu wanaagsan ee laga heli karo.
But since.	Laakiin tan iyo.
I still got the other one	Wali waan helay kii kale
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
I do not eat.	Ma cunto.
I was someone else.	Waxaan ahaa qof kale.
I was told not to say anything	Waxa la igu yidhi waxba ha odhan
To find out.	Si aad u ogaato.
I'm sorry he left.	Waan ka xumahay wuu baxay.
I knew where it would be	Waan ogaa meesha ay noqon doonto
I think he knows what's going on	Waxaan filayaa inuu garanayo waxa jira
I have to go early	Waa inaan mar hore tago
Not much.	Ma aha wax badan.
They will not let them do it any other way.	Uma ogolaan doonaan inay si kale sameeyaan.
I am very happy.	aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I did not think you would be here.	Uma malaynayn inaad halkan joogi doonto.
He tried to come back.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu soo noqdo.
Only once.	Kaliya hal mar.
I'm glad you're here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto
A friend was always with me	Saaxiib mar walba la joogay
He had, as soon as he had a chance.	Wuu lahaa, isla markii uu fursad u helo.
He did not want you to know that you can do this.	Ma uusan rabin inaad ogaato inaad tan samayn karto.
I want more than that	Waxaan rabaa wax ka badan kan
Not everyone is included.	Qof kastaa kuma jiro.
In fact, there may be no time.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan jirin waqti.
But not in my opinion.	Laakiin maaha sida aan qabo.
I did not want to know anything else	Ma rabin inaan wax kale ogaado
Maybe he already had.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hore u lahaa.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
I will help	Waan caawin doonaa
I always thought that was weird	Had iyo jeer waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay tahay yaab
I wanted him to leave	Waxaan rabay inuu baxo
I still can't see well	Weli si fiican uma aan arki karin
I did not understand everything	Wax walba maan fahmin
Most of the time, you are.	Inta badan, waxaad tahay.
I will not tell him anything	Waxba u sheegi maayo
It 's good, it' s not a big deal.	Way fiican tahay, wax weyn maaha.
This is a real job.	Tani waa shaqo dhab ah.
I could not help it	Ma caawin karin
It is a very bad idea.	Waa fikrad aad u xun.
I still wanted more	Weli wax badan ayaan rabay
I wanted to see.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko.
She had no idea she would return	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay soo noqon doonto
I wanted to talk to him	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo
I did not think you could take it	Uma malaynayn inaad qaadan karto
This will not hurt you.	Tani waxba kuma yeeli doonto.
I guess they really don’t like it personally	Waxaan filayaa inay run ahaantii aanay jeclayn qof ahaan
I liked what you said	Waxaan ka helay waxaad tidhi
I want to	waxaan rabaa
He did not get it.	Ma uusan helin.
I left	Aniga ayaa iska tagay
I'm still out	Weli waan ka baxay
I know we can be close friends	Waan ogahay inaan noqon karno saaxiibo dhow
He has already done this, as a food.	Waxa uu tan hore u sameeyay, cunto ahaan.
Something he had	Wax uu lahaa
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay.
I can't even tell what you look like.	Xitaa ma sheegi karo waxaad u egtahay.
I have to say it is very beautiful	Waa inaan sheego inay aad u qurux badan tahay
Something similar is happening here.	Wax la mid ah ayaa halkan ka socda.
I would not believe what he said	Ma rumaysan lahaa wax uu yidhi
A little later.	In yar ka dib.
I know you like it very much	Waan ogahay inaad aad u jeceshahay
He should not have said anything.	Ma ahayn inuu wax sheego.
They are there.	Waxay ku jiraan halkaas.
I really did not believe that	Runtii taas maan rumaysan
I did not know who she was	Maan garanayn cidda ay tahay
We need you not here in prison	Waxaan kuu baahanahay halkan kuma jiro xabsiga
More than once.	In ka badan hal mar.
He did not speak.	Ma uusan hadlin.
In fact, a lot of that had to do with me.	Run ahaantii, wax badan oo taas ka mid ah waxay ahayd inay aniga igu sameeyaan.
You can see it often.	Waad arki kartaa inta badan.
But he seemed happy to speak.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan inuu hadlo.
Do you know.	Ma ogtahay.
I really was	Runtii sidaas ayaan ahaan jiray
But not much.	Laakiin ma badna.
Older man now.	Nin hadda ka weyn.
I know what she would say.	Waan garanayaa waxay odhan lahayd.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.	Malaha maanta maaha, malaha berri maaha, laakiin way dhici doontaa.
I came in.	Waan soo galay.
That she did.	Taas oo ay samaysay.
As often.	Sida badan.
I hope you would do something	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax qaban lahayd
I told him it had already been done	Waxaan u sheegay in mar hore la sameeyay
Who would have thought ?.	Yaa u malayn lahaa?.
I surprised you	Adiga ayaan kaa yaabay
I still think this is a very interesting job.	Weli waxaan qabaa in tani ay tahay shaqo aad u xiiso badan.
I have no problem	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo
I know you probably won't believe me	Waan ogahay inay u badan tahay inaadan i rumaysan doonin
Certainly that was.	Hubaal taasi waxay ahayd.
I have a lot to do with that	Wax badan ayaan u hayaa taas
I did not think it would be so	Uma malaynayn inay sidaas noqon doonto
No one even knows where he is.	Qofna xitaa ma garanayo meesha uu joogo.
I left a lot today	Aad ayaan maanta uga baxay
I need to leave for a while	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka baxo in muddo ah
It was a difficult day, a difficult time.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag, waqti adag.
I wanted to be with him	Waxaan rabay inaan la joogo isaga
That was how it felt.	Taasi waxay ahayd sida laga dareemay.
I had an amazing time again	Waxaan mar kale helay waqti yaab leh
I'm really not sure.	Runtii taas ma hubo.
I really was not one of them	Runtii anigu kama aan mid ahayn
Everything is fine.	Wax walba way ku fiican tahay.
They probably need more.	Waxay u badan tahay inay u baahan yihiin in ka badan.
She said she did not want to be seen together.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay doonayn in la isla arko.
He was an unbelievable man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aan la rumaysan karin.
I have one now.	Mid baan hadda joogaa.
I hope he does.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameeyo.
I can't find anything to work on	Wax aan ku shaqeeyo ma heli karo
I love making	Waan jeclahay samaynta
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
One true friend.	Hal saaxiib oo run ah.
I certainly can't stop now.	Hubaal hadda kuma joojin karo.
I have no intention of leaving	Wax niyad ah uma hayo inaan tago
I have a strong idea of ​​that	Waxaan qabaa fikrad adag taas
But it was.	Laakiin waxay ahayd.
There will be no more unemployment.	Ma jiro shaqo la'aan mar dambe.
That was probably.	Taasi waxay ahayd malaha.
I really like this one.	Runtii waan jeclahay kan .
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u weyn.
I'm scared	waan ka baqayaa
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
He still hasn't said anything	Wali waxba ma odhan
I'll be back.	Dib ayaan ugu soo noqon doonaa.
He is afraid of you.	Wuu kaa baqayaa.
I know how it is	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay
I know he has.	Waan ogahay inuu leeyahay.
you will do well	si fiican ayaad u samayn doontaa
I hope it will be so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas ahaan doonto.
Feeling at the door.	Dareemay albaabka.
.	.
I think he was really unable to speak	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dhab ahaantii aan awoodin inuu hadlo
Surprisingly, she was just like me.	Si la yaab leh, waxay u ahayd sidii aniga oo kale.
He did not want to know, but he did.	Ma uusan rabin inuu ogaado, laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I couldn’t stop to find out	Waan joojin waayay si aan u ogaado
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I think so quickly.	Waxaan u maleynayaa si degdeg ah.
I may not say it correctly.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan si sax ah u odhan.
It really looks like that.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay sidaas.
I wanted to know more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ka ogaado
That's what she did.	Taasi waa waxa ay samaysay.
You can do it.	Waad samayn kartaa.
Let them do what they need to do.	Ha sameeyaan waxay u baahan yihiin inay sameeyaan.
I should have seen if you were better,	Waxay ahayd inaan arko haddii aad fiican tahay,
No one understood	Qofna ma fahmin
I want to see you again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale arko
I heard everything that was said.	Waxaan maqlay wax kasta oo la yidhi.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I made time for it.	Waqti ayaan u sameeyay.
But tomorrow is another day.	Laakiin berri waa maalin kale.
I really did not find anything to say	Runtii maan helin wax aan ku sheego
Great stuff, just great !.	Waxyaabo aad u fiican, kaliya aad u fiican!.
But it is difficult for us.	Laakiin way nagu adag tahay.
A little.	In yar .
It is said.	Waxa lagu yidhi.
I really did he said	Runtii waan sameeyay wuxuu yidhi
I am not that.	Anigu taas ma ihi.
He knew now that he was home.	Wuu ogaa hadda inuu guriga u dhow yahay.
He is a good friend.	Waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
But he does.	Laakiin wuu hayaa.
I guess they really aren't	Waxaan filayaa inaysan run ahaantii ahayn
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
Tell him he will not come here again.	U sheeg inuusan mar dambe halkan iman.
Many other things.	Waxyaabo kale oo badan.
But much can be said.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa la odhan karaa.
I know how bad you want this	Waan ogahay sida xun ee aad tan u rabto
I decided to go	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan u tago
I'm not sure you know that.	Ma hubo inaad taas ogtahay.
I have a lot to tell you	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan kuu sheego
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
I love when he does that	Waan jeclahay marka uu sidaas sameeyo
I don't think they do.	U malayn maayo inay sameeyaan.
How could he not see that.	Sidee buu taas u arki waayay.
I really wanted it now	Aad ayaan u rabay hadda
He looked good tonight.	Caawa si wanaagsan buu u muuqday.
Too much money.	Lacag aad u badan.
It's a little difficult.	Waa dhib yar.
But that's enough.	Laakiin taas ku filan.
It is too long.	Aad buu u dheer yahay.
That is what you need to do.	Taasi waa waxa aad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso.
I really want it.	Aad baan u rabaa.
No one saw him.	Qofna ma arag isaga.
I would not say much.	Wax badan ma odhan lahaa.
But here is a strange problem.	Laakiin halkan waa dhibaato yaab leh.
That was the hardest thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa aad u adag.
Would anyone tell me what to do?	Ma qof baa ii sheegi lahaa waxaan sameeyo.
This is how it works.	Tani waa sida uu u shaqeeyo.
I don't know why this is so.	Ma garanayo sababta ay tani sidaas u tahay.
I will not like it.	Ma jeclaan doono.
Stop what you are doing.	Jooji waxaad samaynayso.
We'll see what he can do.	Waan arki doonaa waxa uu qaban karo.
To help each other.	In la is caawiyo.
It is better to say it again	Waxaa fiican inaan mar kale sheego
I have no idea what to do tonight	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxa aan sameeyo caawa
I know where he lives	Waan ogahay meesha uu ku nool yahay
I always wonder why he did that	Had iyo jeer waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu sidaas u sameeyay
Tell them that.	U sheeg taas.
But she will not do it again.	Laakiin mar dambe ma samaynayso.
One small.	Mid yar.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
I became a man.	nin baan noqday.
I hope they are alive	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay nool yihiin
I decided to continue talking.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sii hadlo.
Indeed, he said.	Runtii, wuxuu yidhi.
I do not want to go anywhere else.	Ma rabo inaan aado meel kale.
I was one.	Mid baan ahaa.
He was a very smart man.	Nin caqli badan buu ahaa.
I will talk to you about everything	Wax walba waan kula hadli doonaa
It is a job.	Waa shaqo.
I just know what she told me.	Kaliya waxaan ogahay waxay ii sheegtay.
I want to be the best for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kuu noqdo kan ugu fiican
That is a long time.	Taasi waa wakhti dheer.
She did not want to lie to him.	Ma rabin inay been u sheegto.
No one can be present	Qofna lama joogi karo
He may need to buy.	Wuxuu u baahan karaa inuu iibsado.
You really look like someone else.	Runtii waxaad u egtahay qof kale.
She couldn't see anything.	Waxba way arki wayday.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
No one really took it.	Qofna si dhab ah uma qaadan.
Him, I'm not sure.	Isaga, ma hubo.
I know enough to say	Waxaan garanayaa waxyaabo igu filan oo aan sheego
Pick it up now.	Hadda soo qaado.
I couldn’t believe he was really out	Ma rumaysan karin in uu run ahaantii baxay
It's great, and rightly so.	Aad bay u fiican tahay, iyo si sax ah.
They will come.	Way iman doonaan.
I can't believe how small it is, how beautiful it is	Ma rumaysan karo sida ay u yar tahay, sida ay u qurux badan tahay
If he is so good.	Haddii uu sidaas u wanaagsan yahay.
How good is that?	Sidee u fiican taasi?.
You are a true friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib dhab ah.
But another and.	Laakiin mid kale iyo .
I'm not sure	Ma hubo tan
Until someone else knows how to carry it.	Ilaa qof kale uu ogaado sida loo sii qaado.
he will be fine.	wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
That is why it is not needed.	Taasi waa sababta aan loo baahnayn.
Maybe I should do it again	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar kale sameeyo
After all, too.	Ka dib, sidoo kale.
I have never been able to do that	Weligay ma awoodin inaan taas sameeyo
Otherwise I would not be here.	Haddii kale halkan ma joogi lahayn.
He promised me that.	Wuu ii ballan qaaday taas.
I am very happy to see you here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan ku arko
It amazes me.	Waa iga yaab.
But there were a lot of good things, too.	Laakiin waxaa jiray waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
Don't tell them anything.	Waxba ha u sheegin.
I wanted a little, but not too much	Waxaan rabay wax yar, laakiin aad uma yara
Me and you.	Aniga iyo adiga.
It's hard work.	Waa shaqo adag.
I want to stay home with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan guriga kula joogo
I think it is true	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay
Just so good.	Kaliya aad u fiican.
I have to tell you this	Waa inaan tan kuu sheego
Small but constant	Yar laakiin joogto
I started to do little	Waxaan bilaabay inaan wax yar sameeyo
I would like you to stay here now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan sii joogto hadda
And it really has.	Oo runtii waxay leedahay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Among them.	Ka mid ah.
Still very happy	Weli aad u faraxsan
Great guy really.	Nin weyn runtii.
He didn't even give me a chance.	Xitaa fursad ima uu siin.
I don't see that at all	Taas waxba uma arko
But not less.	Laakiin ma yara.
I applied correctly.	Waxaan si sax ah u codsaday.
I did, a long time ago	Waxaan sameeyay, waqti dheer ka hor
I could not be better	Waan ka fiicnaan waayay
Love to talk.	Jecel in la hadlo.
I wonder if there is anything that can be done	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii ay jiraan wax la qaban karo
It was really home.	Runtii wuxuu ahaa guriga.
They do not do it today.	Maanta ma sameeyaan.
I need to know this.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado tan.
Something similar to getting.	Wax la mid ah in la helo.
I would like to stay longer	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sii joogo waqti dheer

I was left again	Mar kale ayaa la iga tagay
I had to find out what happened	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
I heard enough for you.	Waxaan maqlay wax kugu filan.
You do not have.	Ma aadan lahayn.
They are really bad.	Runtii aad bay u xun yihiin.
What a wonderful surprise !.	Yaab fiican oo kale!.
Someone was here.	Qof baa halkan joogay.
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto.
I hope they will actually end at once	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhab ahaantii ku dhammaan doonaan hal mar
There was nothing available.	Ma jirin wax la hayo.
I do not.	Ma sameeyo.
It seems to me a bit difficult.	Waxay ila tahay wax xoogaa igu adag.
You will get it.	Waad heli doontaa.

Any chance ?.	Fursad kasta?.
He told us.	Ayuu noo sheegay.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
I really know this	Runtii tan waan ogahay
I really have no one.	Dhab ahaantii qofna ma haysto.
I did not want to study	Ma rabin inaan wax barto
He always thought that everyone loved him.	Had iyo jeer wuxuu u maleynayay in qof kastaa uu jecel yahay isaga.
I knew there was not much he could do	Waan ogaa inaysan jirin wax badan oo uu qaban karo
How can it be.	Sidee buu noqon karaa.
Maybe not.	Ma laga yaabaa.
He could not take it anymore.	Mar dambe wuu qaadan waayay.
You need time.	Waxaad u baahan tahay waqti.
I didn't think he wanted me	Uma malaynayn inuu i rabo
I am there with you	halkaas ayaan kula joogaa
No one knows where he went.	Qofna ma garanayo meel uu aaday.
I thought you were	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay
It was like everything else.	Waxay ahayd sida wax kasta oo kale.
There is very little idea.	Ma jiro fikrad aad u yar.
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono

I have never seen that before	Weligay taas hore uma arag
I would do anything to get it.	Waxaan sameyn lahaa wax kasta si aan u helo.
Now let me do the same.	Hadda aan sidaas oo kale sameeyo.
It can not be so	Ma noqon karo sidaas
No one else can be you.	Qof kale adiga ma noqon karo.
I can see why she likes him	Waan arki karaa sababta ay isaga jeceshahay
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
She looks like she can see.	Waxay u egtahay inay arki karto.
Here today, gone tomorrow.	Halkan maanta, berri tagay.
That was rejected.	Taasi waa la diiday.
I was always surprised by that	Mar walba taas ayaan la yaabay
I will not be there again	Mar dambe halkaas ma joogi doono
She did something.	Wax bay samaysay.
Really happy for him.	Runtii aad ugu faraxsan isaga.
I did not tell him why.	Maan u sheegin sababta.
He is a good man.	Waa nin fiican.
I wish you would see him	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad arki lahayd isaga
Bad day.	Maalin xun.
Great trouble and great opportunity	Dhibaato weyn iyo fursad weyn
It doesn't matter, really.	Waxba maaha, runtii.
This will get him, all the same.	Tani waxay heli doontaa isaga, dhammaan isku mid.
I really liked it at first.	Aad ayaan uga helay markii hore.
I really hope to find out!	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ogaado!
Today, not much.	Maanta, ma badna.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
That is not what happened.	Taasi maaha waxa dhacay.
I want to talk to him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo.
Everything is done.	Wax walba waa la sameeyay.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
I wanted to know everything about him	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ka ogaado isaga
That is not a lie.	Taasi been ma aha.
I want to see what is in it first	Waxaan rabaa inaan marka hore arko waxa ku jira
I want to help with that	Waxaan rabaa inaan taas ku caawiyo
But only one day.	Laakiin maalin kaliya.
There was nothing really going on.	Ma jirin wax si dhab ah u socda.
He said he knew a man.	Wuxuu yidhi nin baan garanayaa.
But I do not.	Laakiin ma sameeyo.
What happened next is uncertain	Maxaa dhacay ka dib lama hubo
Not at all difficult.	Ma aha mid adag oo dhan.
I wonder if tomorrow will be so busy	Waxaan la yaabay haddii berri ay sidaas oo kale mashquul noqon doonto
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
I knew what we needed to do	Waan ogaa waxa aan u baahanahay inaan samayno
Here and here.	Halkan iyo halkan.
I knew what she was doing	Waan ogaa waxay samaynayso
Few will do it now.	Wax yar ayaa hadda sameyn doona.
I know that will really help me a lot	Waan ogahay in taasi runtii wax badan i caawin doonto
That could be a good thing.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa wax fiican.
I got that from him	Taas ayaan ka helay isaga
Mary refused to leave	Maryan way diiday inuu baxo
It was no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma ahayn.
I've been here for a while.	In muddo ah ayaa halkan joogay.
He really did not know.	Runtii ma uu ogayn.
I was a little early	Waxaan ahaa wax yar hore
He said he was doing it.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu samaynayo.
But this is very interesting.	Laakiin tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I know what you did to me	Waan ogahay waxaad igu samaysay
I really went out.	Runtii aad ayaan u baxay.
I could not say to him	Ma aan odhan karin isaga
He did.	Waxa uu sameeyay.
He says that's right.	Wuxuu yidhi taasi waa sax.
I only did this once.	Mar kaliya ayaan tan sameeyay.
It's good for me.	Way ii fiican tahay aniga.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
I know that, she knows that.	Waan ogahay taas, way ogtahay taas.
I can tell he needs it	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inuu u baahan yahay
Everyone was surprised to see me there.	Qof kastaa wuu la yaabay inuu halkaas igu arko.
I had to do something big, big	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo wax weyn, wax weyn
I really want to talk to you	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
I need to know who to tell	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado cidda aan u sheego
I felt rejected	Waxaan dareemay in la diiday
I felt a lot to eat now	Waxaan dareemay wax badan inaan hadda wax cuno
I had to do it yesterday	Waxay ahayd inaan shalay sameeyo
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqada aado
I know something he does not know	Waxaan ogahay wax uusan ogeyn
I can't now	Hadda ma awoodo
Now is the time to start seeing.	Hadda waa markii aan bilaabay inaan wax arko.
No idea came up.	Ma jiro wax fikrad ah oo soo baxay.
Will help me.	I caawin doona.
I can do it quickly	Si degdeg ah ayaan u samayn karaa
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
Someone loves you.	Qof ayaa ku jecel.
This she did for three men.	Tani waxay u samaysay saddex nin.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay in la yaqaan.
I thought it was very good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u wanaagsan tahay.
I think it could still be better	Waxaan filayaa inay wali ka sii fiicnaan karto
He is afraid to be seen.	Wuxuu ka baqayaa in la arko.
I will win again tonight	mar kale ayaan guulaysan doonaa caawa
I think he was right.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu sax ahaa.
I wanted to do more for him tonight	Waxa aan rabay in aan caawa wax ka badan ku sameeyo isaga
It just can't happen that way.	Ma dhici karto oo kaliya sidaas.
But he had to know for sure.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inuu si dhab ah u ogaado.
I know it looks amazing.	Waan ogahay in ay u egtahay wax yaab leh.
It is too.	Waa sidoo kale.
I am not the same man.	Ma ihi nin la mid ah.
I looked fast	Waxaan u muuqday mid degdeg ah
I wondered how it would be	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay noqon doonto
I would love to do it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo.
I think he should talk about it	Waxaan qabaa inuu ka hadlo
You would have been earlier.	Hore ayaad ahaan lahayd.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
No one will tell you what it will be like.	Qofna kuu sheegi maayo sida ay noqon doonto.
I did that yesterday and today	Taas shalay iyo maanta ayaan sameeyay
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
Maybe this will be right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay sax noqon doonto.
It is what they do.	Waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
That would be something.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax.
I had to get it.	Waxay ahayd inaan helo.
I need to go	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago
I did not give much	In badan maan siin
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
I can see why you like it	Waan arki karaa sababta aad u jeceshahay
This cannot be you.	Tani ma noqon karto adiga.
But no problem.	Laakiin dhib ma leh.
I want him to get what he really wants	Waxaan rabaa inuu helo waxa uu runtii rabo
I have to know it better	Waa inaan si fiican u garanayaa
I have to wonder why.	Waa inaan la yaabaa sababta.
We will see what he has to say.	Waan arki doonaa waxa uu leeyahay.
Everything will help.	Wax walba ayaa ku caawin doona.
He asked what he said.	Waxa uu waydiiyay waxa uu yidhi.
I just looked and looked	Kaliya waan eegay oo eegay
I think it will be interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay noqon doonto mid xiiso leh.
You were right there.	Waxaad ahayd sax halkaas.
I would love that.	Waan jeclaan lahaa taas.
A little but not much	Wax yar laakiin ma badna
And no food.	Oo cunto la'aan.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
It would be true.	Run bay ahaan lahayd.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
would not do	ma yeeli lahayn
Very good, he should go.	Aad u fiican, waa inuu aado.
I knew there was something strange about you	Waan ogaa inay jiraan wax kaa yaab leh
I have to get a chance.	Waa inaan fursad u helo.
It can happen.	Way dhici kartaa.
I thought, maybe.	Waxaan u maleeyay, malaha.
It looks like a fun job.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo xiiso leh.
He is much older than me.	Aad buu iga weyn yahay.
It is who and what you are.	Waa qofka iyo waxa aad tahay.
See you here, everyone.	Halkaan ku arag, qof walba.
I wanted to keep it but	Waxaan rabay inaan ku sii hayo laakiin
But not only that.	Laakiin ma aha ka kaliya.
I could no longer see	Anigu mar dambe lama arki karin
But we just.	Laakiin waxaan kaliya.
Now, not too much.	Hadda, aad uma badna.
I am so.	Waxaan ahay sidaas.
Afterwards, he wondered why he did it.	Ka dib, wuxuu la yaabay sababta uu sidaas u sameeyay.
It looked so bad.	U muuqday mid aad u xun.
I think it is beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan tahay.
I want to work with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
I know you are happy	Waan ogahay inaad faraxsan tahay
I was not present	Maan joogin
It’s still my favorite.	Waa ilaa hadda aan jeclahay.

I have done it for a long time	Waxaan sameeyay muddo dheer
I want you to do something	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax sameyso
I have to tell you something	Waa inaan wax kuu sheego
I have no one.	Cidna ma hayo.
I think that is the only thing we can do	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno
I really want to be like that	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan sidaas noqdo
I was, after all, at work	Waxaan ahaa, ka dib oo dhan, shaqada
I really can't.	Runtii ma awoodo.
I wanted to be there early	Waxaan rabay inaan goor hore halkaas joogo
I got that from you	Taas adiga ayaan ka helay
I can see	waan arki karaa
I'm not sure if that is true.	Ma hubo inay taasi sax tahay.
It is not a lie.	Been maaha.
Maybe another.	Laga yaabaa in mid kale.
I even thought it could be more than one	Xitaa waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon karto wax ka badan hal
But you should not.	Laakiin waa inaadan.
But you can't do that.	Laakiin taas ma samayn kartid.
That is enough for me.	Taasi waa igu filan tahay.
I doubt someone will come today	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in uu qof iman doono maanta
I did not want to do that	Maan rabin inaan taas sameeyo
This can be very difficult.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u dhib badan.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
I have already fallen	Hore ayaan u dhacay

He did not have.	Ma uu haysan.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan lahayd
I need to know everything that is going on	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado wax kasta oo socda
This does not look like much.	Tani uma eka wax badan.
How difficult is this.	Sidee u adag tahay tani.
That is not a good place to be.	Taasi maaha meel wanaagsan oo la joogo.
It was really not given to anyone.	Run ahaantii qofna lama siin.
Don't do it	Ha samayn
I know this is true for me.	Waan ogahay inay tani run igu tahay aniga.
I was amazed at how small everything was.	Waxaan aad ula yaabay sida wax walba u yar yihiin.
I could not do that again	Taas mar kale ma aan samayn karin
You know, you don't have to do that.	Waad ogtahay, maaha inaad sidaas samayso.
He said he was right.	Waxa uu yidhi waa sax.
But it is not there.	Laakiin meesha ma joogto.
I can't find one there	Ma heli karo mid halkaas
He had no friends.	Saaxiibo ma lahayn.

More will be needed	Wax badan ayaa loo baahan doonaa

I am not talking about it here	Ka hadli maayo halkan
I do not understand how it went now	Maan fahmin sida uu hadda u baxay
I should not be arrested	Waa inaan la i qaban
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad fiican.
He did not say.	Ma uu odhan.
That you do not lie.	In aadan been ka sheegin.
He decided he would never like it.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuusan waligiis jeclayn.
The house will be done much earlier.	Guriga waxa la samayn doonaa ka hor wax badan.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah igama haysto.
Everything is fine.	Wax walba waa fiican yihiin.
And still.	Oo weli.
Not sure now.	Ma hubo hadda.

I think he is happy about this	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku faraxsan yahay arrintan

I have been through this a lot	In badan ayaan tan ku dhacay
I looked for a long, long time	Waxaan eegay muddo dheer oo dheer
He would come, but maybe he wouldn't stay.	Wuu iman lahaa, laakiin malaha ma uu joogi lahaa.
A few years.	Dhowr sano.
I never thought it was so bad.	Weligay uma malaynayn inay sidaas u xun tahay.
I did not see where he went	Meel uu aaday maan arag
Not that.	Ma aha in.
Only man.	Nin kaliya.
But what can you do? 	Laakiin maxay samayn kartaa?
Just hold me.	Kaliya i qabo.
I need to find someone else.	Waxaan u baahanahay in la helo qof kale.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I thought how would you like to know	Waxaan u maleeyay sida aad jeclaan lahayd inaad ogaato
you did nothing.	waxba ma aadan samayn.
For the most part, it is not.	Inta badan, ma aha.
I can do it, no one else	Waan samayn karaa, qof kale ma jiro
There is really not much more to say.	Runtii wax badan oo kale ma aha in la sheego.
You are a good person.	Waxaad tahay qof wanaagsan.
I really think it is	Dhab ahaantii waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay

She is very good at that.	Aad bay ugu fiican tahay taas.
I really have to learn something tonight	Runtii waa inaan wax ka barto caawa
You have to be happy.	Waa inaad ku faraxsan tahay.
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
Much is clear.	In badan ayaa cad.
I hope he knows that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu taas garanayo
He was unemployed.	Shaqo la’aan ayuu ahaa.
We are always.	Waxaan had iyo jeer nahay.
I just couldn't go out.	Kaliya ma bixi karin.

He will be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
No one can help please.	Qofna ma caawin karaa fadlan.
I did not do well.	Si fiican uma aanan qaban.
I have so much for you	Wax badan ayaan kuu hayaa
I wonder why he could not pay.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu u bixin waayay.
I think this is a good idea	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad fiican
I have three jobs.	Waxaan hayaa saddex shaqo.
I'm afraid that's true	Waxaan ka baqayaa taasi waa run
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I did not go.	Ma tagin.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I think she is my favorite.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay kan aan jeclahay.
And maybe it was true.	Oo malaha run bay ahayd.
I can't leave now	Hadda kama bixi karo
Very nice money, and home too	Lacag aad u qurux badan, iyo guriga sidoo kale
I hope all will be well	Waxaan rajeynayaa in dhammaan ay fiicnaan doonaan
I have no idea where he is.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo meesha uu joogo.
I will stay here if you need anything.	Waan joogi doonaa halkan haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
Until he felt it.	Ilaa uu dareemay.
I'm sure that will happen.	Waxaan hubaa inay taasi dhici doonto.
I can't give you anything	waxba kuma siin karo
I should not have been so surprised	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas ula yaabay
I was not able to help	Ma awoodin inaan caawiyo
Only a few years later you know.	Dhowr sano ka dib kaliya waad ogtahay.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn.
One more problem.	Hal dhibaato oo kale.
I just have to know how	Kaliya waa inaan ogaado sida
I have to go out and everyone else	Waa inaan baxo oo qof kasta oo kale tago
I have to get it.	Waa inaan helo.
All set.	Dhammaan waa la dhigay.
But it was not.	Laakiin ma ahayn.
I wanted to be everywhere but here	Waxaan rabay inaan joogo meel kasta laakiin halkan
We will stay here	Waanu joogi doonaa halkan
He really loves you, you know.	Runtii wuu ku jecel yahay, waad ogtahay.
Really bad, really.	Runtii xun, dhab ahaantii.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
You will love it.	Waad jeclaan doontaa.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I know you will have a good time	Waan ogahay inaad waqti fiican qaadan doonto
Maybe I would do too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale sameyn lahaa.
Well given.	Si fiican ayaa loo siiyay.
All three years.	Saddex sano oo dhan.
I know that already.	Waan ogahay taas mar hore.
I can't do anything	Waxba ma qaban karo
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ma jiro wax xun oo aan ka sheego.
I have done it before	Hore ayaan u sameeyay
This is what it is.	Tani waa waxa ay tahay.
More than that, it can be anything.	In ka badan, waxay noqon kartaa wax walba.
This is true for me.	Tani waa run aniga.
It will not be.	Ma ahaan doonto.
I do not want to	ma rabo
I do not know what that is, to do it	Ma garanayo waxa taasi ay tahay, inaan taas sameeyo
I have to know he is fine	Waa inaan ogaado inuu fiican yahay
There is nothing new here	Ma jiro wax cusub halkan
I didn't like it.	Maan jeclayn.
I started to work differently	Waxaan bilaabay in aan si kale u shaqeeyo
I pretended not to exist	Waxa aan iska dhigay in aanay jirin
I hope he doesn't leave early	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan hore u bixin
will be.	noqon doonaa.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
This is not something that can be done.	Tani maaha wax sidaas lagu samayn karo.
A little less, really	In yar oo ka yar, dhab ahaantii
He looked at us.	Wuu na eegay.
Mostly it is very good	Inta badan waa wax aad u fiican
Everyone else has it.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa leh.
I got some food to eat	Waxaan helay xoogaa cunto ah oo aan cuno
I did not want to be like him	Ma rabin inaan noqdo isaga oo kale
I am not the person you want me to be	Ma ihi qofka aad rabto in aan noqdo
She said she didn't.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay samayn.
you were right	sax baad ahayd
I really did not want to know more about it	Runtii ma rabin inaan wax badan ka ogaado
Much more.	Inta badan in ka badan.
They will be home soon.	Waxay noqon doonaan guriga dhawaan.
He could not believe he had left us	Ma rumaysan karin inuu naga tagay
he will take me.	wuu i qaadan doonaa.
He said he was not.	Wuxuu sheegay inuusan ahayn.
I can't stay here	Ma joogi karo halkan
It's better than hard.	Way ka fiican tahay adag.
I hope you have a great time	Waxaan filayaa inaad waqti fiican heli doonto
It looks bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun.
Still without food.	Weli cunto la'aan.
I found	waan helay
I do this all the time.	Waxaan tan sameeyaa mar kasta.
I knew it wasn't really.	Waan ogaa in aysan run ahaantii ahayn.
We will help you if you help us.	Waan ku caawin doonaa haddii aad na caawiso.
I got a lot of good friends there.	Waxaan halkaas ka helay saaxiibo badan oo wanaagsan.
I found myself doing the same thing	Waxaan isku arkay inaan samaynayo isla wax la mid ah
We give you time.	Waxaan ku siin waqti.
I didn't think so at first	Uma malaynayn marka hore
I told him, but he did not believe me	Waan u sheegay, laakiin ima rumaysan
I could not believe what had just happened	Waxaan rumaysan waayay waxa hadda dhacay
It will be.	Waxay noqon doontaa.
For me this is a big deal.	Aniga ahaan tani waa wax weyn.
I think that is why it is so.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay sababta ay sidaas u tahay.
Tom couldn't see anything.	Tom waxba ma arki karin.
What happened now I could not do	Waxa hadda dhacay maan qaban karin
I hope you find out	Waxaan rajeynayaa in la ogaado
You were just.	Waxaad ahayd kaliya.
It can be a lot.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax badan.
But it was real.	Laakiin dhab bay ahayd.
I had to do this	Waxay ahayd inaan tan sameeyo
I have no idea how good this is.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto sida tani u fiican tahay.
That is, right unless it is.	Taasi waa, sax ilaa aysan ahayn.
I wanted to do that.	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas sameeyo.
It doesn't say much.	Wax badan ma sheegto.
Something happened.	Wax baa dhacay.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
Do not take it seriously.	Si dhab ah ha u qaadan.
I wish you could see	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad arki lahayd
I have a lot to say about it.	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan ka sheego.
I never thought of that	Weligay uma malaynayn taas
Now we are friends.	Hadda waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
No one else seems to have it.	Qof kale uma eka inuu haysto.
It will no longer be great.	Mar dambe ma noqon doonto mid weyn.
I do not know what happened to me.	Ma garanayo waxa igu dhacay.
I really have to go now	Runtii waa inaan aado hadda
Including.	Oo ku jira.
I had a good time, too	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay, sidoo kale
She didn't think so.	Ma ay malaynayn.
I was surprised it was good	Waxaan la yaabay inay fiican tahay
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
But a little.	Laakiin wax yar.
It can be very difficult as well.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag sidoo kale.
Someone else did it.	Qof kale ayaa sidaas sameeyay.
I can love you everywhere	meel kasta waan kaa jeclaan karaa
But so far nothing has come of it.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax ka soo baxay.
It is best to be there when it does.	Waxaa fiican inaad halkaas joogto marka ay sameyso.
And I got nothing back.	Oo waxba dib uma helin.
If it doesn't matter to you, that's fine.	Haddii aanay adiga waxba kugu ahayn, taasi waa fiican tahay.
I think you are good for him	Waxaan filayaa inaad isaga u fiican tahay
I really don't like it.	Runtii ma jecla.
I am so happy to see you again.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan dib kuu arko.
I doubt it will be permanent	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu noqon doono mid joogto ah
Which may be too.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay sidoo kale tahay.
I want to keep it close	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku hayo meel u dhow
This is enough.	Tani waa ku filan tahay.
It's hard to say.	Way adag tahay in taas loo sheego.
And it will be.	Oo noqon doona.
I did not like the former, so to speak	Maan jeclayn kii hore, si aan wax ugu sheego
Everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
This will happen.	Tani way dhici doontaa.
I really need to go	Waxaan si dhab ah ugu baahanahay inaan tago
I don't like it.	Ma jecla.
I only want one.	Waxaan rabaa mid kaliya.
I want him to leave	Waxaan rabaa inuu baxo
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
I want to know how to do this.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida tan loo sameeyo.
But it just isn't true.	Laakiin kaliya run maaha.
No one spoke	Cidna lama hadlin
You are very good.	Aad baad u fiican tahay.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
But there was, exactly what he needed.	Laakiin waxaa jiray, dhab ahaan waxa uu u baahan yahay.
I have to do it right.	Waa inaan si sax ah u sameeyaa.
No one has come yet.	Weli qofna ma iman.
I got the best.	Waxaan helay waxa ugu fiican.
I have nothing	waxba ma hayo
But this will not go away.	Laakiin tani ma bixi doonto.
One for you, one for me.	Mid adiga, mid aniga.
I did not want to have it forever	Ma aanan rabin in aan weligay haysto
I would do it again and again.	Mar kale iyo mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa.
She didn't want to do what someone else was doing.	Ma rabin inay samayso wax qof kale samaynayo.
That is not true, he said.	Taasi sax maaha ayuu is yidhi.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
They need me.	Way ii baahan yihiin.
He said badly.	Si xun buu u yidhi.
I had to get out of there, now	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas ka baxo, hadda
He didn't want her to do that.	Ma uu rabin in ay sidaas samaynayso.
But maybe it shouldn't be.	Laakiin malaha waa in aanay noqon.
I would love to see you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko
He knew what was coming.	Wuu ogaa waxa soo socda.
I should not stay	Waa inaanan sii joogin
But at first nothing was seen.	Laakiin markii hore ma jirin wax la arkay.
I need time	Waxaan u baahanahay waqti
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u fiican.
I would do the same	sidaas oo kale ayaan yeeli lahaa
He left	Wuu tagay
It's the same for me.	Waa isku mid aniga.
The longer, the better.	Inta dheer, ka sii fiican.
That is, if you do the same.	Taasi waa, haddii aad sidaas oo kale sameyso.
So, let me help.	Marka, aan caawiyo.
Wonder how it was done.	Yaab sida loo sameeyay.
Today, he knows very little.	Maanta, wax yar ayuu yaqaan.
If you do, this is for you.	Haddii aad sameyso, tani waa adiga.
I was not able to see	Ma aan awoodin inaan arko
I had to leave tonight	Waxay ahayd inaan baxo caawa
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
I think it turned out to be very beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inuu noqday mid aad u qurux badan
He thought he would leave.	Wuxuu mooday inuu ka bixi doono.
I know him, he knows me.	Waan garanayaa isaga, wuu i yaqaan.
There is nowhere to go.	Meel la aado ma jirto.
He knows what he did to me.	Wuu garanayaa waxa uu igu sameeyay.
A little, you might say.	In yar, waxaad odhan kartaa.
I got it now !.	hadda waan helay!.
Not to be found.	Si aan loo helin.
Not now.	Ma aha hadda.
It will do.	Way yeeli doontaa.
I do not see.	Ma arko.
I can not stay there	Ma sii joogi karo halkaas
I don't know how to do it.	Ma garanayo sida uu u sameeyo.
I asked her what she was doing.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa ay samaynayso.
For a long time.	Muddo dheer.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
I should not have seen it again	Ma ahayn inaan mar kale arko
And another.	Iyo mid kale.
I could not see anything clearly	Wax si cad uma arki karin
Is that correct?	Ma sax baa?.
Several friends watched	Dhowr saaxiibo ah ayaa eegay
I knew there was something	Waan ogaa in ay wax jiraan
I wanted to see this.	Waxa aan rabay in aan tan arko.
Even if it is very small.	Xitaa haddii ay aad u yar tahay.
You must not do it again.	Waa inaadan dib u samayn.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
She had to know what to do now.	Waxay ahayd in ay ogaato waxa ay samayn lahayd hadda.
I could not think of anything else	Wax kale maan malayn karin
So very.	Sidaas aad u.
I decided to eat well and work	Waxaan go'aansaday in aan si fiican wax u cuno oo aan u shaqeeyo
It will not be so.	Sidaas ma ahaan doonto.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
She is much younger than him.	Aad bay uga yar tahay isaga.
I did not know how this could be	Maan garanayn sida ay tani noqon karto
There is so much to do now.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo hadda la sameeyo.
No more.	Mar dambe ma yara.
I heard about it yesterday	Shalay ayaan ka maqlay
I just can't go for that.	Kaliya taas ma aadi karo.
Any way you want.	Si kasta oo aad u rabto.
I am not, he said.	Anigu ma ihi, ayuu yidhi.
I want to help, he said	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo, ayuu yiri
I saw something strange	Waxaan arkay wax yaab leh
I need to talk.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadlo.
I have nothing to eat	Wax aan cuno ma haysto
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
But that is how it was.	Laakiin taasi waa sidii ay ahayd.
This was hard work.	Tani waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
I knew it was right.	Waan ogaa inay sax ahayd.
I had a really good time.	Waxaan lahaa waqti aad u fiican runtii.
I wanted to know more about him	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ka ogaado isaga
But not everyone does.	Laakiin qof walba ma sameeyo.
I want to go to work	Waxaan rabaa inaan shaqada tago
I did not like to tell him	Maan jeclayn inaan u sheego
Nothing all the time.	Waxba mar kasta.
You should too.	Waa inaad sidoo kale.
I really wanted to see everyone	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan arko qof walba
Wonder what happened.	Yaab waxa dhacay.
And another man.	Iyo nin kale.
I will make one for you	Mid baan kuu samayn doonaa
He is here to help me.	Wuxuu halkan u joogaa inuu i caawiyo.
I would like her to help me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay i caawiso
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
And I do not get it.	Oo anigu ma helo.
I want him to say more.	Waxaan rabaa inuu wax badan sheego.
I told her it was	Waxaan u sheegay inay tahay
I can do that	Taas waan samayn karaa
He knew what to do.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu samayn lahaa.
It has been very bad for a few years.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun dhowr sano.
I wonder why that is	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta ay taasi tahay
This is not a problem.	Tani dhib ma aha.
I think it will happen.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay dhici doonto.
We will see what we can do	Waan arki doonaa waxaan sameyn karno
I love it so much, so, so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay sidaas, si, aad u badan
I can leave now	Hadda waan bixi karaa
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
We need to do more.	Waxaan u baahanahay in la sameeyo wax ka badan.
I will not be told	La ii sheegi maayo
It will not hurt you and me.	Ma yeeli doono adiga iyo aniga.
I just need a place to be	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay meel aan joogo
I am very sorry about that.	Aad iyo aad ayaan uga xumahay taas.
I would never do that	Weligay taas ma yeeli lahayn
I think it's a good thing.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax fiican.
What is a new.	Maxaa cusub.
You can speak whatever you want.	Waxaad ku hadli kartaa waxaad doonto.
I know he loves you	Waan ogahay inuu ku jecel yahay
Maybe you have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad leedahay.
Less than nothing.	In ka yar waxba.
In fact, everything comes with it.	Dhab ahaantii, wax kasta oo la socda.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
He looked so much bigger.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad uga weyn.
There must be more than that	Wax badan oo ka badan waa inay jiraan
A place he does not want to be	Meel uusan rabin in uu joogo
But there is one problem for him.	Laakiin waxaa jira hal dhibaato isaga.
But if there is enough interest.	Laakiin haddii ay jirto xiiso ku filan.
I know how difficult it is	Waan ogahay sida ay u adag tahay
I don't like many people right now	Ma jecli qof badan hadda
All can be expected as well.	Dhammaan sidoo kale waa la filan karaa.
I did not know where else to go	Meel kale oo aan aado maan garanayn
I can tell he doesn't want to	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inuusan rabin
I could not allow it	Waan kuu ogolaan waayay
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
I heard but did not speak	Waan maqlay laakiin ma hadlin
It will not last long.	Ma sii joogi doono wakhti dheer.
I found it here	Waan ka helay halkan
I did not want to go anywhere else	Maan jeclayn inaan meel kale aado
I did that.	Taas waan sameeyay.
They will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samayn doonaan.
I need to know, once and for all	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado, hal mar iyo dhammaan
I happened to know what happened	Waxa dhacay in aan ogaado waxa dhacay
I came back.	Dib ayaan u soo noqday.
I wanted to see them all.	Waxaan rabay inaan wada arko.
You can help us	Waad na caawin kartaa
I hope there is more to come	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay jiraan wax badan oo soo socda
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
I didn't even have that	Xitaa taas maan haysan
Not only that.	Kaliya lama samayn.
She has him.	Waxay leedahay isaga.
That may be too little for you.	Taasi waxaa laga yaabaa inay kugu yar tahay.
Mostly this is true.	Inta badan tani waa run.
Better yet.	Si taas ka wanaagsan.
I should have been a bit lucky now, for sure	Waxay ahayd in la igu leeyahay xoogaa nasiib ah hadda, hubaal
Something had to be done.	Wax ay ahayd in la sameeyo.
Now like the other one.	Hadda sida kan kale.
I could not do it	Waan qaban waayay
People who are good at each other.	Dadka ay isku wanaagsan yihiin.
I love everything you do	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo aad sameyso
I knew he would stop there.	Waan ogaa inuu halkaas ku joojin doono.
I can help him with that.	Taas waan ka caawin karaa isaga.
It was given to me.	Waa la i siiyay.
This was true.	Tani run bay ahayd.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
I took that to leave	Taas ayaan u qaatay in aan baxo
He thought she could do it.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inay samayn karto.
I want to help	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
I would definitely stay there again.	Dhab ahaantii waan sii joogi lahaa halkaas mar kale.
It would be nice if someone could help me.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii qof i caawin karo.
I had no chance	Wax fursad ah ma helin
You have to do better.	Waa inaad taas wax ka fiican samayso.
I will not say anything.	Waxba uma sheegi doono.
When he comes to school.	Marka uu dugsiga yimaado.
I want to go and do everything with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado si aan wax walba kula sameeyo
I have to be here for you	Waa inaan halkaan kuu joogaa
I never did.	Weligay maan samayn.
It looks obvious.	Waxay u egtahay mid cad.
Several others had the same idea	Dhowr qof oo kale ayaa lahaa fikrad la mid ah
Something terrible happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
I didn't have much.	Wax badan igama lahayn.
I can't do anything right now	Hadda waxba ma awoodo
what did you say	maxaad ka tidhi.
It’s not something you can’t do.	Ma aha waxa aadan samayn karin.
I think everyone knows who they are.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba garanayo cidda ay yihiin.
I can be a long time	Waxaan noqon karaa waqti dheer
I got a chance to get to know him	Waxaan helay fursad aan ku barto isaga
I always came out.	Mar walba waan ka soo bixi jiray.
I can't stay with one person	Ma la joogi karo hal qof
But you are lucky.	Laakiin nasiib baad leedahay.
I do not know if they are alive	Ma garanayo inay nool yihiin
But it was small.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax yar.
What he said he did.	Waxa uu ku lahaa wuu sameeyay.
I just want to go home	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado
There is a lot of good in this.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo wanaagsan tan.
Soon, he would say.	Dhawaan, wuxuu odhan lahaa.
Well done here.	Si fiican ayaa halkan loo sameeyay.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
Tom went back a bit.	Tom dib buu u yara baxay.
Please, take it.	Fadlan, qaado.
But you will get out of it.	Laakiin waad ka soo bixi doontaa.
I have to see him again, soon	Waa inaan mar kale arko isaga, meel dhow
I think that was it	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd
I think everyone can see that	Waxaan filayaa in qof kastaa arki karo taas
I had to find out what it was	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxay ahayd
I want to get one for me	Waxaan rabaa inaan mid ka mid ah ii helo
I just need to make time.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan waqti sameeyo.
I know she is with you	Waan ogahay inay kula joogto
I think he needs a friend.	Waxaan filayaa inuu u baahan yahay saaxiib.
A little.	Wax yar.
You were a loving person.	Waxaad ahayd qof jecel.
I refused to say why	Waxaan diiday in aan sheego sababta
I did not want a big problem	Ma rabin dhibaato weyn
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
I came back to you	waan kuu soo noqday
He must have it.	Waa inuu haysto.
I doubt it is any	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay tahay mid kasta
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
I think that is difficult	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi adag tahay
Let me tell you something.	Hadda aan wax kuu sheego.
She told me to tell her she was not here.	Waxay ii sheegtay inaan u sheego inaysan halkan joogin.
I know that not everyone is able to do this	Waan ogahay in qof walba uusan awoodin inuu tan sameeyo
Another is unknown.	Mid kale lama garanayo.
I will tell you why.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa sababta.
I will come to you again	Mar kale ayaan kuu iman doonaa
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
But there was something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jiray.
From place to place.	Meel ilaa meel kale.
I really need to talk to him.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga.
It was home.	Waxay ahayd guriga.
I can't, I just can't.	Ma awoodo, kaliya ma awoodo.
I did nothing wrong.	Waxba igama aan samayn.
That was a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha.
I really hope you will too	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto
Small and large.	Yar iyo weyn.
He should never have given up.	Ma aha in uu waligiis ka noqon lahaa.
I can't do it anymore.	Mar dambe ma samayn karo.
I no longer believe it	Mar dambe ma rumaysan
I came in with everything	Wax walba waan soo galay
Everyone has one.	Qof kastaa mid buu leeyahay.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
I have not seen it yet	Wali ma arag
I did not want to talk about what has just happened	Ma rabin inaan ka hadlo waxa hadda dhacay
I can't believe this	Ma rumaysan karo tan
I hope you enjoy it	Waxaan filayaa inaad si fiican u heli doonto
We need it there maybe now more than ever	Waxaan u baahanahay halkaas malaha hadda in ka badan sidii hore
They are in a very difficult time.	Waxay ku jiraan waqti aad u adag.
I want to go home now please	Waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado hadda fadlan
I can see why they need it	Waan arki karaa sababta ay ugu baahan yihiin
I really like this one	Runtii waan jeclahay kan
This was more than enough.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad uga badan oo ku filan.
I have not received it yet	Weli aad uma helin
What do you think.	Maxay kula tahay.
There may be another.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu jiro mid kale.
I knew it was probably nothing	Waan ogaa inay malaha waxba ahayn
It is the only place we can go.	Waa meesha kaliya ee aan aadi karno.
I hold it well	si fiican ayaan u hayaa
It really is true.	Runtii waa run.
But they do not.	Laakiin ma sameeyaan.
There was not enough.	Ma jirin wax ku filan.
I have a lot to work with	Wax badan oo aan la shaqeeyo ayaan hayaa
I took it again	Mar kale ayaan isla qaatay
No one saw it	Cidna ma arag
I do not like it here any more	Ma jecli halkan in ka badan
But there must be more than that.	Laakiin waa in ay jiraan wax ka badan taas.
I will do it tomorrow	Berri ayaan samayn doonaa
I asked him to tell me.	Waxaan ka codsaday inuu ii sheego.
And that there is always someone worse there.	Iyo in mar walba uu jiro qof ka xun halkaas.
I know you have to do it	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad sameyso
I will do this much	Tan wax badan ayaan samayn doonaa
Bad things really happened.	Runtii waxyaabo xun baa dhacay.
I did not say	Maan sheegin
Just tell me what you need.	Kaliya ii sheeg waxaad u baahan tahay.
I need to know that this is true	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado in tani run tahay
I can't take this now	Hadda maan qaadan karin tan
I think you need something	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax u baahan tahay
I want to see what else is out there	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko waxa kale oo halkaas ka jira
She said she needed a friend.	Waxay sheegtay inay u baahan tahay saaxiib.
Too much.	Si aad u badan.
And just not at work.	Oo kaliya maaha shaqada.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
There was nothing else	Wax kale ma jirin
She seems to have done this before.	Waxay u egtahay in ay tan hore u samaysay.
That is a strange thing to have.	Taasi waa wax la yaab leh in la haysto.
I can't do anything right now	Hadda wax ma qaban karo
I have nothing like it	Wax la mid ah ma hayo
Probably not so much.	Malaha ma badna.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
Mostly this is good.	Inta badan tani way wanaagsan tahay.
That was amazing.	Taas oo ahayd yaab.
I am, as it were, here.	Waxaan ahay, sida ay ahayd, halkan.
This is a good idea, but it is not true.	Tani waa fikrad fiican, laakiin run maaha.
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan la hadlo.
That is what really happened.	Taasi waa waxa dhab ahaantii dhacay.
Now I can't take anything else.	Hadda wax kale ma qaadan karo.
This is really interesting.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa mid xiiso leh.
I really want to see him	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan arko isaga
You will find this.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa tan.
You can get money anywhere.	Meel kasta ayaad lacag ka heli kartaa.
I have to go to see him	Waa inaan aado si aan isaga arko
You will not find me.	Ima heli doonto.
I know where you are doing	Waan ogahay meesha aad samaynayso
There is not enough to do.	Ma jiraan wax ku filan oo la sameeyo.
He would not go any further.	In ka badan ma uu aadi lahaa.
I hope you have.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad leedahay.
I never got that again	Weligay taas mar dambe ma helin
I did not want to go	Maan jeclayn inaan tago
He knew that.	Wuu ogaa taas.
I have not understood that for a long time.	Taas maan fahmin muddo dheer.
I do not think this is true	U malayn maayo in tani run tahay
That is too long.	Taasi aad bay u dheer tahay.
I have amazing friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo yaab leh.
I think that is good	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi u wanaagsan tahay
You will be a man.	Waxaad noqon doontaa nin.
I wanted to, and even tried several times	Waxaan rabay, oo xitaa isku dayay dhowr jeer
I'm glad you did here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan samaysay
Tell me more now.	Hadda wax badan ii sheeg.
A huge problem, really.	Dhibaato aad u weyn, dhab ahaantii.
He never knew who he was.	Waligiis ma uu garanayn cidda uu yahay.
I am in a lot of trouble.	Dhibaato badan ayaan ku jiraa.
As you do everything else.	Sida aad sameyso wax kasta oo kale.
It remains to be seen whether they will.	In ay yeeli doonaan iyo in kale waa la arki doonaa.
I told him he was fine.	Waxaan u sheegay inuu fiican yahay.
She was everyone else.	Waxay ahayd qof kale oo dhan.
She did not want to.	Ma ay rabin.
It was much more difficult than that.	Waxay ahayd mid aad uga dhib badan taas.
I would definitely go there again.	Dhab ahaantii waan aadi lahaa halkaas mar kale.
It would be interesting.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
It is not present.	Ma joogto.
He had other things.	Waxyaabo kale ayuu lahaa.
I want to do something	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax sameeyo
It looks obvious.	Waxay u egtahay mid cad.
I will not say anything	waxba odhan maayo
I know where to find him	Waan garanayaa meel aan ka helo isaga
We have been friends for a long time.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo muddo dheer.
And very smart.	Oo aad u caqli badan.
Maybe I could be a better place	Malaha meel ayaan ka fiicnaan karaa
I didn't think he would	Uma malaynayn inuu samayn doono
They will find it here and there.	Waxay ka heli doonaan halkan iyo halkaas.
I could not do anything.	Waxba kama qaban karin.
I will not return.	Soo noqon maayo.
It was good.	Waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I thought that was smart	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi caqli tahay
I did not know that anyone was here	Maan ogayn in qof halkan joogo
It looks like more.	Waxay u egtahay in ka badan.
What else is needed?	Maxaa kale oo loo baahan yahay?
I hope this can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
To talk to you.	In aan kula hadlo.
I want what is best for you	Waxaan rabaa waxa kuu fiican
There was no other way out.	Meel kale oo laga baxo ma jirin.
I should have.	Waxay ahayd inaan haysto.
Now he does.	Hadda wuu sameeyay.
I think they will be here now	Waxaan filayaa inay halkan joogi doonaan hadda
But he refused to leave.	Laakiin wuu diiday inuu baxo.
I could not say what she thought.	Ma sheegi karin waxay la tahay.
I will not discuss it here.	Anigu halkan kama hadli doono.
But so far he has not gone.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma uu tagin.
I knew it would be too early	Waan ogaa inay goor hore noqon doonto
It is a very difficult job.	Waa shaqo aad u adag.
I think it can be done.	Waxaan filayaa in la samayn karo.
That is a good thing.	Taas oo ah wax wanaagsan.
It was too early to say.	Waxay ahayd goor hore oo aan weli la sheegin.
But somewhere else.	Laakiin meel kale.
This is hard to do.	Tani waa adag tahay in la sameeyo.
You can be a person.	Waxaad noqon kartaa qof.
I just want the content	Kaliya waxaan rabaa waxa ku jira
I looked, long and hard	Waxaan eegay, dheer oo adag
They are really good.	Runtii way fiican yihiin.
I'm really happy!	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay!
I was ready for a lot.	Wax badan ayaan diyaar u ahaa.
I do not understand this	Maan fahmin tan
I am here	halkaan ayaan ku joogaa
He was a real person.	Wuxuu ahaa qof dhab ah.
There is none.	Ma jirto.
I hope you do too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale sameyso.
You would do the same.	Waxaad samayn lahayd sidaas oo kale.
Something had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in wax la sameeyo.
I could not go to him	Ma tagi karin isaga
It was a while ago.	Hore ayaa wax yar ka hor.
Nothing great is seen.	Wax weyn lama arko.
I don't see much of him, maybe that's why.	Wax badan uma arko isaga, malaha waa sababta.
I thought that was beautiful	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi qurux badan tahay
She said he was gone.	Waxay tidhi wuu baxay.
I knew what to do	Waan ogaa waxa la samayn lahaa
It didn't take long.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer.
I like to be told what to do	Waxaan jeclahay in la ii sheego waxaan sameeyo
I don't know if he loves me or not.	Ma garanayo inuu i jecel yahay iyo in kale.
I wonder if anyone can really	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii qof runtii awoodo
I hope they do not give you a hard time	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan ku siin waqti adag
Luckily, too.	Wax nasiib leh, sidoo kale.
I don’t know why someone would be otherwise.	Ma garanayo sababta qof u noqon lahaa si kale.
I can't do anything to help you	Wax aan ku caawiyo ma samayn karo
You need us.	Waad noo baahan tahay.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I don't know what it is.	Ma garanayo waxa ay tahay.
I hope they are close here	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay halkan meel ku dhow yihiin
He picked it up and left.	Wuu soo qaaday oo baxay.
I will not say.	Ma sheegi doono.
No one spoke to me.	Qof igama hadlin.
Not sure	Ma hubo taas
I knew he had someone	Waan ogaa inuu qof leeyahay
I can't do this.	Ma samayn karo tan.
I heard enough.	In ku filan ayaan maqlay.
Interesting so far.	Xiiso ilaa hadda.
I have to do this for myself	Waa inaan tan ii sameeyaa
I had to do something to get it	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sameeyo si aan u helo
I still can't believe it.	Wali ma rumaysan karo.
He should not.	Ma ahayn inuu.
Much more.	Wax badan ka sii badan.
I entered the house and took it	Guriga ayaan soo galay oo qaatay
No one told me how to do that.	Qofna uma sheegin sida taas loo sameeyo.
It looks like recently.	Waxay u egtahay dhawaan.
I think everyone else did.	Waxaan filayaa in qof kasta oo kale uu sidaas sameeyay.
A job he clearly wanted	Shaqo uu si cad u rabay
Tell her how it is.	U sheeg sida ay tahay.
What do you think?.	Maxay kula tahay?.
If only he had come up with something new.	Haddii uu hadda wax cusub la iman lahaa.
But someone will do it.	Laakiin qof ayaa sameyn doona.
There was not much he could do here.	Ma jirin wax badan oo uu halkan ka qaban karo.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
I really know	Runtii waan ogahay
She did not give what she wanted	Ma siin waxa ay rabto
I want to be a good person	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof wanaagsan
I did not want to work on one	Ma rabin in aan mid ka shaqeeyo
Don't do this to me again.	Mar dambe tan ha igu samayn.
She had no idea what she was doing.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan waxay samaysay.
He looked at me again.	Mar kale ayuu i eegay.
I am so happy to see him	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan arko isaga
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
They love things as they are.	Waxay jecel yihiin wax sida ay yihiin.
Not at the same time.	Isku waqti maaha.
I need to not know what he is feeling right now.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaanan garanayn waxa uu hadda dareemayo.
He was once one.	Mar ayuu ka mid ahaa.
I really didn't have a friend	Runtii saaxiib maan lahayn
I would like to know more about this	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado arrintan
I was the one who came up with it	Aniga ayaa ahaa kii la yimid
I say, now, it is.	Waxaan leeyahay, hadda, waa.
It was great to be there.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in la helo halkaas.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax fiican oo wanaagsan.
I can say that you really need me now.	Waxaan sheegi karaa inaad runtii ii baahan tahay hadda.
I don't have to.	Ma aha inaan.
I will not just leave here	Kaliya halkan kama tagi doono
I don't want it anymore.	Mar dambe ma rabo.
Most did not.	Inta badan ma samayn.
You know this is true.	Waad ogtahay in tani ay run tahay.
It's hard to say.	Way adag tahay in la sheego.
I tried to see how he would do it	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u arko sidii uu yeeli lahaa
I felt like everyone else.	Waxaan dareemay sidii qof kale oo dhan.
That's not a big deal.	Taasi wax weyn maaha.
But, there is no luck in that.	Laakiin, nasiib ma leh taas.
He is someone who is walking towards me.	Waa qof ii socda.
Everyone had a good time.	Qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa waqti fiican.
What is done is done.	Waxa la sameeyo waa la sameeyaa.
You can't help that.	Ma caawin kartid taas.
It is a great opportunity.	Waa fursad weyn.
I didn't know that at first.	Taas maan ogayn markii hore.
I was the one who got you	Waxaan ahaa kii ku helay
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
It looks great, it looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn, waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
I suspect this is what happened	Waxaan tuhunsanahay in tani ay tahay waxa dhacay
A little busy here	Mashquul yar halkan
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
I need to talk to you very, very bad	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo si aad iyo aad u xun
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
I decided to keep it	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sii haysto
I am someone else	Waxaan ahay qof kale
But one problem.	Laakiin hal dhibaato.
I think he lives there	Waxaan filayaa inuu halkaas ku nool yahay
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
But that hasn't happened for a while.	Laakiin taasi ma ay helin, in muddo ah.
I am in a lucky place	Waxaan joogaa meel nasiib leh
It’s probably not something you want to do on a regular basis.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn wax aad rabto inaad si joogto ah u sameyso.
I did it once, but not too much.	Hal mar ayaan sameeyay, laakiin aad uma badna.
But, that was it.	Laakiin, taasi waxay ahayd.
Something similar was not ready	Wax la mid ah diyaar uma ahayn
I saw it clearly.	Waxaan u arkay si cad.
Maybe it's a difficult problem.	Malaha waa dhibaato adag.
You are younger.	Waad ka yar tahay.
I think now is a good time	Waxaan filayaa in hadda ay tahay waqti fiican
It's just.	Waa kaliya.
A little of that	In yar oo taas ka mid ah
Would you be one of them?	Ma ka mid noqon lahayd?.
I could not tell anyone else	Qof kale uma sheegi karin
But she refused.	Laakiin way diiday.
I am not ready for that.	Taas diyaar uma ihi.
I did not want to do it	Ma aanan rabin inaan sameeyo
I did not know you were here	Maan garanayn inaad halkan ku jirto
he would return.	wuu soo noqon lahaa.
I had it all laid out	Waxaan lahaa oo dhan la dhigay
I doubt he would have done it for a while	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu samayn lahaa in muddo ah
I told him it was not a good day.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay maalin wanaagsan ahayn.
Nothing came of it here	Halkan waxba kama soo bixin
I didn't even want to see that.	Xitaa maan rabin inaan taas arko.
For a long time.	Waqti dheer.
Now I know this is true	Hadda waxaan ogahay in tani run tahay
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I decided that was enough for me	Waxaan go'aansaday in igu filan
The same can be said for each of us.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa la odhan karaa qof kasta oo naga mid ah.
I am so surprised to see you here today	Aad baan ula yaabay inaan maanta halkan kugu arko
I knew it was too good to be true	Waan ogaa inay aad u wanaagsan tahay inaan run noqdo
I know he will never leave	Waan ogahay inuusan waligiis bixi doonin
He knew it was real.	Wuu ogaa inuu dhab yahay.
A lot is even better.	Wax badan ayaa xitaa ka sii fiican.
That can be done.	Taas waa la samayn karaa.
No one has spoken yet	Weli qofna lama hadlin
You can do that.	Waad samayn kartaa taas.
As well as work.	Iyo sidoo kale shaqada.
I know that, for sure.	Waan ogahay taas, hubaal.
For me, not much.	Aniga, ma badna.
I think it's great	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay weyn tahay
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
The rest, not so much.	Inta kale, ma badna.
It's beautiful.	Waa qurux.
Someone gave me a chance.	Qof baa fursad i siiyay.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ilaa hadda ma jiro.
I knew what had happened.	Waan ogaa waxa dhacay.
There was no place.	Ma jirin meel.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
It will be very beautiful.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u qurux badan.
I hope they will help you	Waxaan filayaa inay ku caawin doonaan
Aren't they ?.	Miyaanay ahayn?.
I don't know him.	Ma garanayo isaga.
Right it really is too.	Sax waa run ahaantii sidoo kale.
Not me.	Aniga ma aha.
There is not much else.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo badan.
He really didn't want to talk about it now.	Runtii ma uu rabin inuu hadda ka hadlo arrintan.
Take your time, he said.	Waqti qaado ayuu is yidhi.
Maybe I should have told him earlier.	Malaha waxay ahayd inaan hore ugu sheego.
I have done this for a very long time	Waxaan taas sameeyay wakhti aad u dheer
Maybe I thought so	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u maleeyay
Only no one spoke	Kaliya cidna lama hadlin
I can't do it tonight	Ma samayn karo caawa
I think that is where this is	Waxaan filayaa in ay taasi tahay meesha ay tani tahay
It was busy	Mashquul ahaa
There is more to this than that.	Waxaa jira wax ka badan tan.
You love it.	Waad ku jeceshahay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
Everywhere and everywhere.	Meel kasta iyo meel kasta.
I knew it would happen again.	Waan ogaa inay mar kale dhici doonto.
I should never have gone.	Ma ahayn inaan weligay tagin.
Now he could not return.	Hadda wuu ka soo noqon waayay.
I have nothing else.	Wax kale ma hayo.
I suspect they are not	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inaysan ahayn
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
Most of the time, he did not speak.	Inta badan, ma uusan hadlin.
You know that.	Waad ogtahay in.
I didn't think it was just that	Uma malaynayn inay tahay kaliya
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I tried to talk to you	Waxaan isku dayay inaan kula hadlo
But that was not done.	Laakiin taas lama samayn.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
I just kept him	Kaliya waan sii dhigay isaga
I thought it would help	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ku caawin doonto
I just can't do anything	Kaliya waxba kama qaban karo
It was a terrible time for everyone.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u xun qof walba.
He didn't even get that.	Xitaa taas wuu heli waayay.
I love doing things for him.	Waxaan jeclahay in aan wax u sameeyo isaga.
I can say that for sure.	Taas ayaan si hubaal ah u odhan karaa.
I can do anything	Wax walba waan samayn karaa
That's what he would do.	Taasi waa waxa uu samayn lahaa.
I hope you find it very interesting	Waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto mid aad u xiiso badan
They don't have to.	Ma aha inay sameeyaan.
I didn't like it.	Maan jeclayn.
Very beautiful for everyone.	Wax aad u qurux badan qof walba.
This could be better.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa si fiican.
I do not have to be here with him	Ma ahan inaan halkaan isaga la joogo
This will not allow one.	Tani ma ogolaan doonto mid.
I will do more.	Wax ka badan ayaan qaban doonaa.
I think he said that.	Waxaan filayaa inuu sidaas yidhi.
I never really understood	Weligay runtii ma fahmin
This is better.	Tani way ka fiican tahay.
I have to do more.	Waa inaan wax badan sameeyaa.
I would love that	Waan jeclaan lahaa taas
Somewhat.	Xoogaa.
You can do anything.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta.
Turns out three.	Ku soo baxay saddex.
I did not know anything until today	Waxba maan ogayn ilaa maanta
I was with him.	waan la joogay.
He did not tell anyone	Cidna uma sheegin
I wonder if anyone can help here	Waxaan la yaabay haddii qof halkan ku caawin karo
That will give you an idea.	Taasi waxay ku siin doontaa fikrad.
But give me a place.	Laakiin meel i sii.
But it was.	Laakiin waxay ahayd.
Maybe I have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan haysto.
I can't do it now	Ma awoodo hadda
But it was all for me.	Laakiin waxay ahayd aniga oo dhan.
There was no other time.	Waqti kale ma jirin.
She is very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
That is what it is.	Waa waxa ay tahay.
I told you you don't like it there	Waxaan kuu sheegay inaadan jeclayn halkaas
I will not lie	Been u sheegi maayo
You can give, but you can't take.	Waad siin kartaa, laakiin ma qaadan kartid.
Take food.	Qaado cunto.
Where it has, great.	Meesha ay ku leedahay, weyn.
Who found us all.	Yaa na wada helay.
He is more likely to tell someone that he has quit his job.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu qof u sheego inuu shaqada ka tagay.
But it should.	Laakiin waa inay.
You can have it.	Waad haysan kartaa.
I can't leave late	Ma ka bixi karo goor dambe
I had no idea it was really bad	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay runtii aad u xun tahay
How is it done?	Sidee loo sameeyaa?.
But don't tell anyone.	Laakiin qofna waxba ha u odhan.
Probably not much.	Malaha wax badan maaha.
He looked at us.	Wuu na eegay.
What was that?	Maxay ahayd taasi.
I know he loves me very much.	Waan ogahay inuu aad ii jecel yahay.
I had to do something.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sameeyo.
There was a man with him.	Nin baa la joogay.
There is no time.	Waqti ma jiro.
I found this here	Tan waxaan ka helay halkan
It was felt after a long time.	Wax badan ka dib ayaa la dareemay.
Today you are better than yesterday.	Maanta waad ka fiican tahay shalay.
Nothing else can be said for sure.	Wax kale oo la odhan karo ma jirto runtii.
I can't stop seeing.	Ma joojin karo inaan arko.
I was very close	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u dhow
I haven't left in a while	In muddo ah maan ka bixin
Why! 	Sababta!
That was one problem.	Taasi waxay ahayd hal dhibaato.
That was a good thing to have.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax fiican in la haysto.
I could not stay	Ma aan joogi karin
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in aad jeceshahay.
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
He didn't need to get it.	Uma baahnayn inuu helo.
I think that is good	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay u fiican tahay
I need to do it first	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan marka hore sameeyo
There is no real work, no real work.	Ma jiro shaqo dhab ah, ma jirto shaqo dhab ah.
Most are not found	Inta badan lama helin
I can't find it all the time	Ma heli karo mar walba
I would not tell.	Uma sheegi lahaa.
I will not leave him	Anigu isaga ka tagi maayo
He will need you as much as you need him.	Wuxuu kuu baahan doonaa inta aad isaga u baahan tahay.
I only made one spoon.	Hal qaado oo kaliya ayaan sameeyay.
There is nothing greater.	Wax ka weyn ma jiro.
There was much he wanted to say.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo uu rabay inuu sheego.
It's a bad thing.	Waa wax xun.
There is nothing that any of us can do.	Wax kale oo naga mid ah oo aanu samayn karin ma jiro.
It was me, just less.	Waxay ahayd aniga, kaliya ka yar.
I have no problem doing this	Wax dhib ah kama qabo in tan la igu sameeyo
This is a minor problem.	Tani waa dhib yar.
Don't assume she'll do it no matter what.	Ha u qaadan inay taasi samaynayso in kasta oo waxa la yidhi.
She didn't want to do it.	Ma ay rabin inay samayso.
Not fast food, but real food.	Ma aha cunto degdeg ah, laakiin cunto dhab ah.
I know what this means for you	Waan ogahay waxa ay tani adiga kugu tahay
I was very impressed with him	Aad ayaan ula dhacay isaga
And don't come back.	Oo ha soo noqon.
I think they are so beautiful and amazing	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u qurux badan yihiin oo yaab leh
I need you to promise me that you will not say anything	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ii ballan qaado inaadan waxba odhan
It is known.	Waa la yaqaan.
I will not tell you	Anigu kuu sheegi maayo
But you can stop him.	Laakiin waad joojin kartaa isaga.
I think he really went out.	Waxaan filayaa inuu runtii baxay.
All in front of me.	Dhammaan iga hor.
I will not tell anyone	Anigu cidna u sheegi maayo
I could not believe it was me	Waxa aan rumaysan waayay in ay aniga tahay
Well said.	Si fiican baa loo yidhi.
This is how it works.	Tani waa sida uu u shaqeeyo.
I will not do it again.	Mar kale ma yeeli doono.
I can stay here for three years.	Waxaan halkaan joogi karaa saddex sano.
I am unemployed	Shaqo la'aan ayaan ahay
Hold on.	Qabo.
I did not want to be part of it	Maan rabin inaan ka mid noqdo
I told him what had happened	Wixii dhacay ayaan u sheegay
I have to know why	Waa inaan ogaado sababta
He didn’t have anything like that.	Ma uusan haysan wax la mid ah.
I took time to get there	Waqti ayaan ku qaatay inaan halkaas tago
I love money	Waxaan jeclahay lacag
Not sure why either.	Ma hubo sababta sidoo kale.
Still, it would be nice.	Weli, way fiicnaan lahayd.
I'm sure he has enough intelligence	Waxaan hubaa inuu leeyahay caqli ku filan
There was no problem.	Dhib ma jirin.
It looks great so far.	Aad bay u egtahay ilaa hadda.
Very good friends.	Saaxiibo aad u wanaagsan.
But nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma jiraan.
I'll see you right	sax ayaan ku arki doonaa
It could be just me.	Waxay noqon kartaa aniga oo kaliya.
He saw enough.	Wax ku filan ayuu arkay.
.	.
I will always love you	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa
I just didn't believe it.	Kaliya maan rumaysan.
I will be here with you	halkaan ayaan kula joogi doonaa
I will always be here for you.	Had iyo jeer waan kuu joogi doonaa halkan.
And he had.	Oo uu lahaa.
In you.	In aad.
I can't go anymore	Mar dambe ma tagi karo
I took it badly at first	Si xun ayaan u qaatay markii hore
Now it is like that.	Hadda waa sidaas oo kale.
I will stay tomorrow	Berri ayaan joogi doonaa
It was more than enough.	Waxay ahayd wax ka badan oo ku filan.
I knew it wasn't real	Waan ogaa inuusan dhab ka ahayn
Obviously, this can take time.	Sida cad, tani waxay qaadan kartaa waqti.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I tried to help him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo isaga.
It's all amazing.	Dhammaan waa yaab.
I don't have that.	Ma haysto taas.
That is not true today.	Taasi maanta run maaha.
They didn't know you were here.	Ma ay ogayn inaad halkan joogto.
That is.	Taas oo ah.
You will cook.	Waad karin doontaa.
I was surprised to talk to him	Waxaan la yaabay inaan la hadlo
I really like to talk to you	Runtii waan jeclahay inaan kula hadlo
I'm sure he hopes to do it	Waxaan hubaa in uu rajaynayo in uu sameeyo
It was quick.	Waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
I don't know if she really likes me or not.	Ma garanayo inay runtii i jeceshahay iyo in kale.
It was not so long.	Ma ahayn sidaas u dheer.
I will give you another chance.	Waxaan ku siin doonaa fursad kale.
But that is so far.	Laakiin taasi waa ilaa hadda.
Very interesting.	Aad u xiiso badan.
I knew it would happen, but	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto, laakiin
I don't know if that's good or bad.	Ma garanayo inay taasi fiican tahay iyo inay xun tahay.
I didn't think he would.	Uma malaynayn inuu samayn doono.
I am very sorry for what happened now	Aad baan uga xumahay waxa hadda dhacay
I can cook anything you need	Waxaan karin karaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay
I would be right	sax baan ahaan lahaa
The time has come.	Waqti ayaa yimid.
I just can't talk	Kaliya kama hadli karo
Obviously they do.	Sida iska cad way sameeyaan.
That was all everyone knew.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhammaan qof kasta oo ogaa.
I have a few friends but nothing real	Waxaan leeyahay dhowr saaxiibo ah laakiin ma jiraan wax dhab ah
I do the same with people	Waxaan dadka la sameeyaa wax la mid ah
This is not for you at all.	Tani adiga oo dhan maaha.
I would like more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax badan
I thought it might help me	Waxaan u maleeyay inay i caawin karto
Fun and exciting, really	Mid xiiso leh oo xiiso leh, dhab ahaantii
It must be started.	Waa in la bilaabay.
Here's how.	Waa kan sida.
But it can be.	Laakiin way noqon kartaa.
I need your help there.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaas iga caawiso.
It is new.	Waa cusub.
Needed, really.	Loo baahan yahay, runtii.
I know she needs it	Waan ogahay waxay u baahan tahay
I just got into a bad time	Kaliya waxaan soo galay waqti xun
I was just a friend	Waxaan ahaa kaliya saaxiib
Great thing even.	Wax weyn xitaa.
I really had no idea	Run ahaantii wax fikrad ah kama haysan
Hold on, all.	Qabo, dhammaan.
But that's not all.	Laakiin ma aha oo dhan.
I wondered what it was	Waxaan la yaabay waxa ay tahay
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
A lot has come out of it.	Wax badan baa ka soo baxay.
That is great.	Taasi aad bay u weyn tahay.
But he wanted to leave.	Laakiin wuu rabay inuu baxo.
No one else took it.	Mid kale ma uu qaadan.
I am happy with that	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas
But not me.	Laakiin aniga maaha.
I don't want to see you.	Ma rabo inaan ku arko.
I will never do that	Weligay taas ma yeeli doono
But I do.	Laakiin taas ayaan sameeyaa.
They will get it too.	Way heli doonaan sidoo kale.
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I really like it every day	Runtii waan jeclahay maalin kasta
Anytime, anywhere.	Waqti kasta, meel kasta.
I think he just wanted to talk	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu rabay inuu hadlo oo kaliya
There was nothing to stay here.	Ma jirin wax halkan lagu sii joogo.
It's hard.	Way adag tahay.
I knew she was there	Waan ogaa inay halkaas joogto
I could not	Maan awoodin
Everyone is happy.	Qof kastaa wuu faraxsan yahay.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay tan.
It will not be a problem	Dhib ma ahaan doono
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax cad.
I knew they weren’t in a very good place	Waan ogaa in aysan joogin meel aad u wanaagsan
You are smarter than him.	Waad ka caqli badan tahay isaga.
I am still in it	Wali waan ku jiraa
It's so beautiful.	Waa wax aad u qurux badan.
Now it is no longer interesting.	Hadda ma sii xiiso badan tahay.
I want to know something tonight	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka ogaado caawa
I did not want to do anything with anyone	Ma rabin in aan cidna wax la sameeyo
I looked good	Waxaan u muuqday mid wanaagsan
I knew he would be.	Waan ogaa inuu noqon doono.
I will do it.	Waan samayn doonaa.
He was not friendly	Ma ahayn mid saaxiib la ah
Coming to him.	Isaga oo u soo socda.
I will never see you again	Weligay ku arki maayo
It will never be the same again	Mar dambe ma ahaan doono sidii hore
If he had taken it back.	Haddii uu dib u qaadan lahaa.
who takes a friend.	kan qaado saaxiib.
I thought he was very lucky	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu aad u nasiib badan yahay
I am here now	hadda waan joogaa
I need to eat.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax cuno.
he was not ready	diyaar uma ahayn
He may not have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan mid lahayn.
He always seems to know everyone.	Wuxuu had iyo jeer u muuqdaa inuu qof walba garanayo.
I know where she is.	Waan ogahay meesha ay joogto.
I had to find out	Waxa ay ahayd in aan wada ogaado
I do not want to do that again	Ma doonayo inaan taas mar kale sameeyo
Still, he was consistent.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, waxa uu ahaa mid joogto ah.
And let me tell you something.	Oo aan wax kuu sheego.
I could not stay here	Halkan ma joogi karin
I really still do.	Runtii wali waan sameeyaa.
You are very fond of it	Aad baad u jeceshahay
It is not.	Ma aha.
There is no one in the whole house.	Guriga oo dhan mid kuma jiro.
And a new job.	Iyo shaqo cusub.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
I gave it to you once	Mar baan ku siiyay
But no one said anything.	Laakiin qofna waxba ma odhan.
That was something else.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax kale.
It will tell you many things.	Waxay kuu sheegi doontaa waxyaabo badan.
I found that better.	Taas ayaan ka helay si ka sii fiican.
We can't help this.	Ma caawin karno tan.
You do not need to do this.	Uma baahnid inaad tan sameyso.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I hope you can see that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad taas arki karto
There was something in it.	Wax baa ku jiray.
He is with a friend tonight.	Caawa saaxiib buu la joogaa.
I knew she was someone who would help me	Waan ogaa inay tahay qof i caawin doona
I have not seen you happy for a long time	Adiga oo faraxsan muddo dheer kuma arag
He is very similar to you, you know.	Aad buu adiga kula mid yahay, waad ogtahay.
I'm sure of that	Waan hubaa taas
I'm just happy to be there	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaas joogo
you will do it	waad sameyn doontaa
He can love it like no other.	Wuxuu u jeclaan karaa sida qof kale.
It would be very interesting.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
See you tomorrow.	Waan arki doonaa sida berrito ah.
The more you do, the more you need.	Inta badan oo aad sameyso, wax badan ayaad u baahan tahay.
All day long.	Maalin dheer oo dhan.
Now he was an adult.	Hadda wuxuu ahaa qof weyn.
Like others.	Sida dadka kale.
It was no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma ahayn.
It just isn't true.	Kaliya maaha run.
I love what she did to you	Waan jeclahay waxa ay ku samaysay
It may not be you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan adiga ahayn.
I just know what they are	Kaliya waan garanayaa waxay yihiin
I know he will never hurt me	Waan ogahay inuusan waligiis i yeeli doonin
At best.	Ugu fiican.
You have been a great help to me tonight.	Caawin weyn baad ii ahayd caawa.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
I am in a much better place now	Meel aad uga wanaagsan hadda ayaan joogaa
I was as surprised as anyone	Waxaan la yaabay sida qof kasta
Now I would like to do that.	Hadda waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sidaas sameeyo.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
No one will hurt you	Qof ma yeeli doono
How fast.	Sidee u degdeg badan tahay.
I don't know if there is anything.	Ma garanayo in ay wax jiraan.
I know it can be done	Waan ogahay in la samayn karo
No one knows what is going on.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa socda.
I had a great time	Waxaan ku qaatay waqti aad u wanaagsan
For me it was a problem.	Aniga waxay ahayd dhib.
I just went in and asked.	Kaliya waan galay oo waydiiyay.
I don't know any better.	Ma garanayo mid ka fiican.
I can't believe they won't tell us	Ma rumaysan karo inaysan noo sheegi doonin
We'll see if it includes.	Waan arki doonaa haddii ay ku jirto.
I will never do it for him	Weligay ma yeeli doono isaga
I can't believe he's gone	Ma rumaysan karo inuu baxay
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi wax walba maaha.
I have no idea what it will be.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay noqon doonto.
Looks like he found someone he was happy with.	Waxay u egtahay inuu helay qof uu ku faraxsan yahay.
I did not want to know	Maan rabin inaan ogaado
I have to be with you	Waa inaan kula joogaa
I found.	waan helay.
I really wanted to help	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
That is.	Taasi waa.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
There is nothing worse than that.	Wax ka xun taas ma jiraan.
It would help if you were here.	Way ku caawin lahayd haddii aad halkan joogi lahayd.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
Not much, but enough.	Ma badna, laakiin ku filan.
I can't find this	Ma awoodo inaan helo tan
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
I did not want to see	Ma rabin inaan arko
I decided to go.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan u tago.
I went there too.	Halkaas ayaan sidoo kale aaday.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
It was obvious why.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad sababta.
I did not want to know	Maan rabin inaan ogaado
I just wonder if they are true	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay inay run yihiin
I have only seen it once	Hal mar oo kaliya ayaan halkan ku arkay
Everything else here is great.	Wax kasta oo kale halkan aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I was somewhere else and at another time	Meel kale iyo wakhti kale ayaan joogay
He may still be alive.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli nool yahay.
It's beautiful, too.	Way qurux badan tahay, sidoo kale.
I did	waan sameeyay
Otherwise it is not very common.	Haddii kale aad uma badna.
I need to talk to you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
You will love it !.	Waad jeclaan doontaa!.
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
I once said that was not a good idea	Mar baan u sheegay in taasi fikrad fiican ahayn
That was really.	Taasi waxay ahayd runtii.
I want you to always be happy	Waxaan rabaa inaad mar walba faraxsan tahay
I still can't leave	Wali ma bixi karin
You really can’t do it.	Dhab ahaantii ma samayn kartid.
I love being with you	Waan jeclahay inaan kula joogo
I have a lot to say	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan sheego
But she was a man.	Laakiin waxay ahayd nin.
I could not see	Waan arki waayay
It will go here and there.	Waxay tagi doontaa halkan iyo halkaas.
It can’t be hard.	Ma noqon karto mid adag.
I did not want him to know	Maan rabin inuu ogaado
A large man came out of the door	Waxaa albaabka ka soo baxay nin weyn
We clearly do not.	Waxaan si cad ma.
As it was.	Sida uu ahaa.
I was surprised to find that we were so similar	Waxaan la yaabay inaan ogaado inaan sidaas isku mid nahay
There was not much	Wax badan ma jirin
I really can't speak right now	Runtii hadda ma hadli karo
I really took that for granted	Runtii taas ayaan u qaadan jiray
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
It will be good for him.	Way u fiicnaan doontaa isaga.
It looks like he will get better.	Waxay u egtahay inuu fiicnaan doono.
I didn't understand anything.	Waxba kama fahmin.
Don't like it, don't take it.	Ha ka helin, ha qaadan.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
He did it three times.	Saddex jeer ayuu sameeyay.
She refused.	Way diiday.
Nice to see you.	Aad bay u fiican tahay inaan ku arko.
I did not see anything	Waxba maan arag
It was here.	Waxay ahayd halkan.
I never did that.	Weligay taas ma samayn.
Tell them what you want.	U sheeg waxaad rabto.
But what ?.	Laakiin waa maxay?.
Both are good.	Labaduba way fiican yihiin.
He was not a bad man.	Ma ahayn nin xun.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
Everything.	Wax walba.
It can happen to anyone.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta.
But he never did.	Laakiin waligiis ma samayn.
I think it has been a while.	Waxaan filayaa inay muddo ahayd.
I thought he had some time	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu haysto muddo
Less than nothing.	In ka yar waxba.
More than me.	Wax iga sii badan.
I knew she was with us	Waan ogaa inay nala joogto
I am very sorry	Aad iyo aad baan uga xumahay
But it is not something he can do at work.	Laakiin ma aha wax uu ku qaban karo shaqo.
Which is amazing.	Taas oo ah wax la yaab leh.
I decided that day ago	Waxaan go'aansaday in maalin ka hor
I want someone else to do it.	Waxaan rabaa qof kale inuu sameeyo.
I do not want to get to know anyone	Ma rabo inaan cidna barto
I did not know you were here	Maan garanayn inaad halkan joogto
Not here.	Ma aha halkan.
I'm just scared.	Kaliya waan ka baqayaa.
That is why you are here.	Taasi waa sababta aad halkan u joogto.
She can't even do that.	Xitaa taas ma samayn karto.
That was real wisdom.	Taasi waxay ahayd caqli dhab ah.
It still exists.	Wali waa jiraa.
I have no problem, really.	Wax dhib ah kama qabo, runtii.
I knew what was coming	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda
But it is definitely not.	Laakiin hubaal maaha.
I will do the job.	Waxaan qaban doonaa shaqada.
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
I got a job	Waxaan helay shaqo
I want to leave something out.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka tago.
Do not say anything else.	Wax kale ha ka odhan.
There is no more.	Ma jiro in ka badan.
No one else.	Qof kale ma jiro.
I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay.
I would talk again.	Mar kale ayaan hadli lahaa.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
He decided.	Wuu go'aansaday.
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
Good food is every meal.	Cunto wanaagsan waa cunto kasta.
I could not believe it	Waan rumaysan waayay
I can't believe she will do that to me.	Ma rumaysan karo inay sidaas igu samayn doonto.
You will love it	Waad jeclaan doontaa
I really don’t.	Runtii ma sameeyo.
I can do that	Taas waan samayn karaa
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
Lots to love here.	Wax badan oo halkan laga jecel yahay.
Wali jecel.	Wali jecel.
I thought he was better	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ka fiican yahay
I have heard that this is true.	Waxaan maqlay in tani run tahay.
I have something for you	wax baan kuu hayaa
He was not a good friend	Ma ahayn saaxiib wanaagsan
She really did	Dhab ahaantii way ii samaysay
I took everything that happened to me	Wax kasta oo igu soo dhacay waan qaatay
Unable to help.	Waa la caawin waayay.
He did not understand that.	Taas ma uu fahmin.
He started everything.	Wax walba ayuu bilaabay.
He still did not want to leave	Wali ma rabin inuu baxo
He knows me very well.	Aad buu ii garanayaa.
I could not do otherwise.	Si kale ma yeeli karin.
I thought she was a person	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay qof
I think that is my favorite	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay kan aan jeclahay
But she said nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma tidhi.
She could not talk about what was going on.	Way ka hadli wayday waxa socda.
I did not tell who	Maan u sheegin cidda
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
I just can't go back	Kaliya kuma noqon karo
I have food for you	Cunto ayaan kuu hayaa
That is the first.	Taasi waa marka hore.
I need you to be here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaan joogto
And if it had already been paid.	Iyo haddii hore loo bixin lahaa.
It would be something else.	Waxay noqon lahayd wax kale.
Not that something happened.	Ma aha in wax dhacay.
At home.	Guriga.
I have to leave for a while	Waa inaan baxo muddo
Sorry, if you want to	Waan ka xumahay, haddii aad rabto
It was to help.	Waxay ahayd in la caawiyo.
I think she loves me	Waxay ila tahay inay i jeceshahay
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
I hope you have a good day	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad leedahay maalin wanaagsan
I thought he had never spoken to me	Waxaan u maleeyay inuusan waligiis ila hadlin
I thought someone like you could help me	Waxaan u maleeyay in qof kula mid ah uu i caawin karo
You can stay here	Halkan ayaad joogi kartaa
It never was.	Waligiis ma ahayn.
Just don't say anything.	Kaliya waxba ha u sheegin.
I do not do this.	Anigu ma sameeyo tan.
I saw each one you can do	Waxaan arkay mid kasta waxaad samayn karto
As you said.	Sida aad sheegtay.
I do not know what to do with it.	Ma garanayo waxaan ku sameeyo.
She was right there.	Waxay ahayd isla halkaas.
It really does not matter where you are.	Runtii dhib ma leh meesha aad joogto.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow	Ma garanayo waxa berri iman doono
It was real.	Dhab buu ahaa.
Don't tell me.	Ha ii sheegin.
Someone picked it up.	Qof ka soo qaaday.
I can't tell you now	Hadda kuma sheegi karo
But something else.	Laakiin wax kale.
I will never tell anyone what happened here tonight.	Weligay cidna uma sheegi doono waxa halkan ka dhacay caawa.
It's a terrible surprise.	Waa yaab aad u xun.
I still want to be your friend	Wali waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiib kuu noqdo
He was a man.	Nin nin buu ahaa.
I really did nothing.	Aan runtii waxba qaban.
Maybe I should.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sameeyo.
It made me a little more beautiful.	Wax yar buu iga dhigay wax qurux badan.
I know you can do more	Waan ogahay inaad wax badan ka qaban karto
It would be nice if someone could help.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii qof uu caawin karo.
I wanted to do something new	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax cusub
I did not understand that.	Anigu sidaas uma fahmin.
He felt lucky.	Nasiib buu dareemay.
I didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inaan.
I felt great	Waxaan dareemay wax weyn
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
They are good at it.	Way ku fiican yihiin.
He wants to talk to us.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu nala hadlo.
To do this we need everyone.	Si tan loo sameeyo waxaan u baahanahay qof walba.
Now it was a lie.	Hadda waxa ay ahayd mid been ah.
You need to do it.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso.
I think everyone does	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba uu sameeyo
I wanted to see	Waxaan rabay inaan arko
I could not do anything	Waxba maan qaban karin
Maybe she can no longer do it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay hadda ka dib ma samayn karto.
We cannot say here what is best for you.	Halkan kuma odhan karno waxa adiga kuu fiican.
I did not know what had happened to him	Maan garanayn waxa ku dhacay
Even more often.	Xitaa inta badan.
I can not stay here	Ma sii joogi karo halkan
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
That was close.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid dhow.
It was, and well.	Waxay ahayd, iyo si fiican.
I know you will love it there	Waan ogahay inaad halkaas ku jeclaan doonto
I don't see why you want it.	Ma arko sababta aad u rabto.
I am not here.	Anigu halkan ma joogo.
I just know it is true	Waxaan kaliya ogahay inay run tahay
I need to leave	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
I know what that looks like	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u egtahay
And what not.	Iyo waxa aan ahayn.
It was small.	Wax yar buu ahaa.
It could be that he is.	Waxay noqon kartaa inuu yahay.
She owes us.	Way nala leedahay.
It's time	Waa wakhti
he said.	ayuu yiri.
Lots of bad that.	Wax badan oo xun in.
There is really no surprise there.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan wax la yaab leh halkaas.
I just did not get it.	Kaliya maan helin.
Otherwise there is none.	Haddii kale ma jiro.
I could not believe what had happened	Waxaan rumaysan waayay waxa dhacay
Since she did there.	Tan iyo markii ay samaysay waxaa jira.
Now, she is fine.	Hadda, way fiican tahay.
I need to know that you will never do it again	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inaadan mar dambe sameyn doonin
But it is not the same.	Laakiin isku mid maaha.
Wax.	Wax.
Are there more cars?	Ma jiraa baabuur badan?.
This was done for free.	Tan waxaa lagu sameeyay lacag la'aan.
Another car came and went.	Baabuur kale ayaa yimid oo baxay.
'and'.	'iyo'.
I lied to you a lot.	Been badan baan kuu sheegay.
I would love to be here to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan joogo si uu u arko
There is no clear reason.	Sababta cad ma jirto.
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
I am always happy to see it	Mar walba waan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko
He tried to help.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu caawiyo.
I would love to see you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko
It is very common.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
It doesn't look like I got enough !.	Uma eka in aan helay wax ku filan!.
Yes.	Waa.
I said nothing	Waxba uma sheegin
There is no truth.	Wax run ah ma jiraan.
I went in and left a little while ago	Hore ayaan u galay oo wax yar ka hor ayaan ka baxay
But there are other things.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale.
I was always at home	Waxaan joogi jiray guriga mar walba
Now I want to go home	Hadda waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado
I can do it all	Dhammaan waan samayn karaa
There really was a lot.	Run ahaantii wax badan baa jiray.
I have to love something to eat.	Waa inaan jeclahay wax aan cuno.
In fact, it is the same problem.	Dhab ahaantii, waa isku dhib.
He seemed to do everything right.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu wax walba si sax ah u sameeyo.
I do not see how it can be	Ma arko sida ay noqon karto
More and more the same.	In ka badan iyo in ka badan isku mid.
But here and there, he does.	Laakiin halkan iyo halkaas, wuu sameeyaa.
I did so.	sidaas ayaan sameeyay.
She did it for me.	Waxa ay igu samaysay.
I had him	Waxaan lahaa isaga
I will go soon	dhawaan ayaan u tagi doonaa
Everyone is very excited about this.	Qof kastaa aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay arrintan.
I didn’t want to know, really.	Ma aanan rabin inaan ogaado, run ahaantii.
.	.
I have not seen it to this day	Maan arag ilaa maanta
I wanted something	Wax baan ka rabay
I came back to tell you	Waxaan u soo noqday inaan kuu sheego
I want to be the same	Waxaan rabaa inaan isku mid noqdo
Quickly today.	Si degdeg ah maanta.
It did not take long	Ma qaadan waqti dheer
I know how much you want this too	Waan ogahay inta aad tan rabto sidoo kale
She has friends here.	Waxay leedahay saaxiibo halkan.
You know it is.	Waad ogtahay inay tahay.
Certainly not now.	Hubaal hadda maaha.
I want it done right	Waxaan rabaa in si sax ah loo sameeyo
He said he didn't like it anymore.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu mar dambe ka helin.
You will see a lot of that.	Waxaad arki doontaa wax badan oo taas ka mid ah.
Like, a lot more.	Sida, wax badan oo badan.
Maybe several.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in dhowr ah.
I could not go home	Guriga ma aadi karin
And here is the best.	Oo halkan waa waxa ugu fiican.
I can't believe he told you	Ma rumaysan karo inuu kuu sheegay
You can do more.	Wax badan ayaad ku qaban kartaa.
They are friends.	Waa saaxiibo.
I will not do that again	Mar dambe taas ma yeeli doono
More is coming.	Wax badan ayaa soo socda.
That would be amazing.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd yaab.
This was nothing new.	Tani ma ahayn wax cusub.
I thought there was	Waxaan u malayn jiray inay jirto
I got something.	Waxaan helay wax.
Whatever you are.	Wax kasta oo aad tahay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I know they will not get anything	Waan ogahay inaysan waxba heli doonin
I will never tell anyone what you said	Weligay cidna uma sheegi doono waxaad tidhi
did not go to prison	xabsiga ma aadi jirin
I did a lot of other things as well	Waxyaabo badan oo kale ayaan sameeyay sidoo kale
I just need to know why he doesn't like me	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta uusan ii jeclayn
I know now that you love me	Waan ogahay hadda inaad i jeceshahay
I have it for a long time	Waxaan hayaa muddo dheer
One I am glad you did	Mid ka mid ah waan ku faraxsanahay inaad samaysay
I was with someone before	Qof hore ayaan ula joogay
I think this could be my new favorite place.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay noqon karto meesha cusub ee aan jeclahay.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha sidaas.
She said she was so beautiful.	Waxay sheegtay inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
Maybe I should tell him	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u sheego isaga
I was a very tough person	Waxaan ahaa qof aad u adag
I really want you	Runtii waan ku rabaa
He had no one.	Cidna ma uu haysan.
He asked how he was.	Waxa uu waydiiyay sida uu yahay.
Not true.	Aan run ahayn.
I have never found another place	Weligay meel kale maan helin
I do not like anything else	Wax kale ma jecli
Mostly this is true.	Inta badan tani waa run.
I could not do it again	Mar kale maan sameyn karin
I know everything is true	Waan ogahay in ay wax walba run yihiin
No wonder, there.	La yaab ma leh, halkaas.
There is no money.	Lacag ma jirto.
It doesn't look familiar.	Wax la yaqaan uma eka.
It was probably, perhaps, the right thing to do.	Waxay ahayd malaha, malaha, wax sax ah oo la sameeyo.
He would stop this.	Wuu joojin lahaa tan.
The school went to get it.	Dugsiga ayaa u baxay inuu helo.
That is difficult for me.	Taasi waa igu adag tahay.
I knew he was close now	Waan ogaa inuu u dhow yahay hadda
I felt that.	Waxaan dareemay taas.
Not a little.	Ma aha in yar.
More time.	Waqti badan.
There is not much else.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo badan.
I told him everything	Wax walba waan u sheegay
He thought it would be nice to see him.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inay fiicnaan lahayd inuu arko.
Real.	Mid dhab ah.
She will get nothing.	Ma jiraan wax ay heli doonto.
I came up with a lot of problems	Dhib badan ayaan la soo galay
I did not know what it was before	Ma garanayn waxay ahayd markii hore
I can't tell anyone else	Qof kale uma sheegi karo
Nice and nice.	Si fiican oo fiican.
I have a better idea	Waxaan qabaa fikrad ka fiican
Just that she was a man.	Kaliya in ay ahayd nin.
I will not return.	Wali soo noqon maayo.
I had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo.
She has money.	Waxay leedahay lacag.
I knew he was there for me	Waan ogaa inuu ii joogo
I tried everything.	Wax walba waan isku dayay.
I had to stay longer	Waxay ahayd inaan in badan la sii joogo
I did not always know this	Mar walba tan ma aan ogeyn
He liked it.	Wuu ka helay.
Tell me strange things.	Waxyaabo yaab leh ii sheeg.
Do I really need another one?	Ma runtii mid kale ayaan u baahanahay?.
I need to talk to you now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda kula hadlo
Just you.	Adiga oo kaliya.
Whatever you had to do.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd inaad sameyso.
But a better place.	Laakiin meel ka wanaagsan.
He had to get out of this.	Waxay ahayd inuu ka baxo arrintan.
I need to know who	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado cidda
Maybe very good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u fiican.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I hope he will help me	Waxaan filayaa inuu i caawin doono
You will help me.	Waad i caawin doontaa.
He said he was happy.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
I expect a lot from people	Waxaan wax badan ka filayaa dadka
I knew he would leave me	Waan ogaa inuu iga tagi doono
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto.
I knew it would come	Waan ogaa inay iman doonto
But she is as good as anyone.	Laakiin way u fiican tahay sida qof kasta.
So does everyone else.	Sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale.
I want it again	Mar kale ayaan rabaa
Today it will be amazing.	Maanta waxay noqon doontaa yaab.
Surprisingly, it was.	La yaabay, waxay ahayd.
Maybe it is too	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidoo kale tahay
I will tell him.	waan u sheegi doonaa .
I didn't want to tell him.	Uma aan doonayn inaan u sheego isaga.
I wanted to keep it	Waxaan rabay inaan sii hayo
I know you will not do that	Waan ogahay inaadan yeeli doonin taas
I tried everything.	Wax walba waan isku dayay.
I did not want to do it	Maan rabin inaan sameeyo
I will do it again.	Mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa.
But he is good at it.	Laakiin wuu ku fiican yahay.
I withdrew from everyone	Qof walba waan ka noqday
I found him where he was.	Meesha uu joogo ayaan ka helay.
That is not common.	Taasi uma badna.
They love each other.	Way is jecel yihiin.
I can tell you who you are	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa qofka aad tahay
Still, it can be done.	Weli, waa la samayn karaa.
I can't believe he did this	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan sameeyay
I have to work to eat	Waa inaan shaqeeyo si aan wax u cuno
I don't know if that can be done.	Ma garanayo in taas la samayn karo.
I was surprised that was true	Waxaan la yaabay in taasi run tahay
Probably so.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sidaas oo kale tahay.
I decided to go home	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan aado guriga
It looks interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid xiiso leh.
But something happened.	Laakiin wax baa dhacay.
That has now been done.	Taas hadda waa la sameeyay.
I left three years ago.	Waxaan ka tagay saddex sano.
I am still, really	Wali waan ahay, runtii
I wanted to stay there forever	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas weligay sii joogo
I'm not sure if this is true	Ma hubo inay run tahay
I did not have time	Waqti maan helin
I can do better than you	Waan samayn karaa si ka fiican adiga
Did what happened.	Ma waxa dhacay.
I am not him.	Anigu ma ihi isaga.
I thought you wanted to	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto
Nothing found	Waxba lama helin
This should be done soon.	Tani waa in dhawaan la sameeyaa.
I am happy to leave this	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan tan ka tago
Neither helped.	Labaduba ma caawin.
I want to see what they contain	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko waxay ku jiraan
You can stop early	Mar hore ayaad joojin kartaa
I need something really urgent.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax runtii degdeg ah.
He got it right.	Si sax ah ayuu u helay.
A man came to the door	Nin baa albaabka yimid
You did it.	Adiga ayaa sameeyay.
Only you and I are there.	Aniga iyo adiga kaliya ayaa jira.
I think that will end	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhammaan doonto
I want to take this	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan qaado
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I know this is an amazing idea	Waan ogahay in tani ay tahay fikrad la yaab leh
There was a lot of fun.	Waxaa jiray xiiso badan.
It was not an emergency.	Degdeg ma ahayn.
Everyone has enough.	Qof walba wax walba wuu ku filan yahay.
I knew it wasn't him	Waan ogaa inuusan isaga ahayn
I do not feel that way	Ma dareemayo sidaas
If you do not like it, very bad.	Haddii aadan ka helin, aad u xun.
I will be coming soon	dhawaan ayaan ku iman doonaa
Same place, same time.	Isku meel, waqti isku mid ah.
As needed, as it is.	Sida loo baahan yahay, sida ay tahay.
I wanted to do that.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas sameeyo.
I have already done this at home	Waxaan tan hore ugu sameeyay guriga
No one thinks so.	Qofna uma malaynayo taas.
I had a good day today	Waxaan lahaa maalin wanaagsan maanta
I hope there are no problems	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan jirin wax dhibaato ah
He wanted to learn more.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax badan barto.
That can happen.	Taasi way dhici kartaa.
It can be good.	Wuu fiicnaan karaa.
I love you you know that	waan ku jeclahay taas waad ogtahay
You are not alone.	Ma aha keligaa.
It does nothing.	Waxba ma samaynayso.
And what they don't say can be found here.	Oo waxa aanay odhan waa laga heli karaa halkan.
He got a lot, after all.	Wax badan ayuu helay, ka dib oo dhan.
He wanted me.	Wuu i rabay.
I hurried in	Si degdeg ah ayaan u galay
As she does now.	Sida ay hadda samaysay.
No matter why.	Dhib malaha sababta.
Even everywhere.	Xitaa meel kasta.
Great, too	Mid aad u weyn, sidoo kale
I can tell that is who she is	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inay taasi tahay qofka ay tahay
I just want to get out of here	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ka baxo
He did not spend much time there.	In badan ma uu joogin halkaas.
Anything small will do !.	Wax kasta oo yar ayaa sameyn doona!.
I am not doing this	Anigu sidaas ma samaynayo tan
I have heard it several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan maqlay
I have been here since yesterday	Waxaan halkan joogay tan iyo shalay
I can't find him	Ma ka heli karo isaga
They will not go.	Ma tagi doonaan.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
But nothing will come.	Laakiin waxba ma iman doonaan.
I know this will be something she will love	Waan ogahay in tani ay noqon doonto wax ay jeclaan doonto
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
But everywhere it is the same.	Laakiin meel walba waa isku mid.
An adult.	Qof weyn.
He did not say where.	Meesha ma uu sheegin.
I told you what to do and why	Waxaan kuu sheegay waxaan samayn lahayn iyo sababta
There was so much he did not know.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo uusan ogeyn.
She said clearly.	Waxay si cad u sheegtay.
I can't say who she was.	Ma sheegi karo cidda ay ahayd.
We do not do that.	Taas ma samayno.
Before I still.	Ka hor inta aan weli.
I decided to leave him alone	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan isaga tago keligiis
I went.	Waa baxay.
I would love to do that to you	Waan jeclahay inaan sidaas kugu sameeyo
So you are.	Sidaas ayaad tahay.
I have to go today	Waa inaan maanta tago
I may be ready to leave tomorrow	Waxaan diyaar u noqon karaa inaan baxo berrito
It didn't matter if it was me or not.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn in ay aniga tahay.
Take a good one.	Qaado mid wanaagsan.
I will not return	soo noqon maayo
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
She did.	Way samaysay.
He probably did.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu sameeyay.
Otherwise we would not have left	Haddii kale ma bixi lahayn
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto.
I have never seen him like that	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale
I certainly could not say anything about the other	Waxaa hubaal ah inaan mid ka kale ka sheegi waayay
It looks really beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay runtii qurux.
I wanted to see it again	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale arko
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma helin.
I have not paid yet	Wali waxba maan bixin
I wanted to know if you are good	Waxaan rabay in aan ogaado haddii aad fiican tahay
I want her to help me	Waxaan rabaa inay i caawiso
I do not understand what has happened now	Maan fahmin waxa hadda dhacay
He was ready to go, anytime.	Wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu tago, wakhti kasta.
Probably more.	Malaha si ka sii badan.
In fact, it is more than that.	Dhab ahaantii, waa wax ka badan.
Here it is.	Waa kan hadda.
Only a few years later you know	Dhowr sano ka dib kaliya waad ogtahay
I know this is hard for you	Waan ogahay in tani ay kugu adag tahay
I really think it is.	Runtii waxaan qabaa inay tahay.
I would like to do more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan sameeyo
He tried to tell her something.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu wax u sheego.
Ah a long time ago.	Ah waqti dheer ka hor.
I told him everything	Wax walba waxaan u sheegay waxba
I just want to be here and now	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan joogo iyo hadda
I want to be a person	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof
I looked at this	Waan eegay tan
I can't believe he didn't tell you	Ma rumaysan karo inuusan ku sheegin
I could not accept this	Ma ogolaan karin tan
I can't do anything else.	Wax kale ma samayn karo.
I know that is a lot of money	Waan ogahay in taasi tahay lacag badan
No one is too close.	Qof aad ugu dhow ma jiro.
Otherwise, very bad.	Haddii kale, aad u xun.
I can't tell him that	Taas uma sheegi karo isaga
I would like to get to know you better.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan si fiican kuu barto.
For a while.	Muddo.
And very big.	Oo aad u weyn.
That is room work.	Taasi waa shaqada qolka.
I did not want it at first	Maan rabin markii hore
But this may not be right.	Laakiin tani sax ma noqon karto.
It is indeed a very interesting place.	Runtii waa meel aad u xiiso badan.
Certainly never did.	Hubaal weligay ma samayn.
I'll talk to you later	dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa
It is very rare that this is true.	Aad bay u yar tahay in ay tani run tahay.
There was something wrong with me	Wax baa jiray aniga
But this is not it.	Laakiin kan maaha.
More work is still needed	Shaqo badan ayaa weli loo baahan yahay
I thought it was hard	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax adag
This was later made one.	Tan markii dambe laga dhigay hal.
That should not be so difficult.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon mid dhib badan.
I just could not see	Kaliya waan arki waayay
I'm happy with what you're doing.	Waan ku faraxsanahay waxaad samaynayso.
He wanted to make it work.	Waxa uu rabay in uu sameeyo si uu u shaqeeyo.
We would not pay.	Ma bixin lahayn.
I decided to do so.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I did not want to say	Ma doonayn inaan sheego
I think he left	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu ka baxay
It will not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon doonto.
I just did not get it	Kaliya maan helin
Everyone rejected me.	Qof kastaa wuu i diiday.
I can stop you	Waan ku joojin karaa
I did not believe that	Maan rumaysan taas
There was not enough food for the people.	Ma jirin cunto ku filan dadka.
This will help.	Tani waxay ku caawin doontaa.
I knew it would hurt	Waan ogaa inay wax yeeli doonto
Not in place.	Meesha kuma jirto.
If anyone has any idea please let me know.	Haddii qof uu wax fikrad ah ka qabo fadlan ii soo sheeg.
But that is not a bad thing.	Laakiin taasi wax xun maaha.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan.
And me.	Iyo aniga.
I don't want a man.	Ma rabo nin.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I will do it.	waan sameyn doonaa.
I love you every day	maalin walba waan ku jeclahay
Wanted to help	La rabay in uu caawiyo
I only heard it later, luckily.	Waxaan maqlay kaliya mar dambe, nasiib.
I could hardly see	Si dhib ah ayaan wax u arki waayay
That will be really interesting	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa runtii xiiso leh
I was very impressed with him	Aad ayaan ula dhacay isaga
I will find you	Waan kuu heli doonaa
I won't get one.	Ma heli doono mid.
I love you so much.	Aad iyo aad ayaan kuu jeclahay.
I am so happy to see the house again	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale arko guriga
He tried to tell me several times.	Dhowr jeer ayuu isku dayay inuu ii sheego.
I have better things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo ka fiican oo aan sameeyo.
It was very, very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad iyo aad u adag.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
I have not seen what will happen to you	ma arag waxa kugu dhici doona
I have to give up everything	Waa inaan wax walba ka tago
She did not understand.	Ma ay fahmin.
I was promised	Waa la ii ballan qaaday
I did not think this would still happen	Uma malaynayn in tani wali dhici doonto
Don't leave me now.	Ha iga tagin hadda.
I knew I needed to but	Waan ogaa inaan u baahanahay laakiin
He is better than me.	Aniga ayaa iga fiican.
I will tell you one day	Waxaan u sheegi doonaa maalin
New one.	Mid cusub.
I want something else	Wax kale ayaan isaga rabaa
I was in it	waan ku jiray
And not who.	Oo maaha yaa.
I used to go out a lot	Aad ayaan uga bixi jiray
Now he had something to do.	Hadda wuxuu lahaa wax uu sameeyo.
And see if she still does.	Oo arag haddii ay weli samaynayso.
I am not a good thing.	Ma ihi wax wanaagsan.
I know she is with him	Waan ogahay in ay tahay cidda uu la joogo
It may include.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ka mid tahay.
I really liked him.	Runtii waan ka heli jiray isaga.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
I knew you would come back	Waan ogaa inaad soo noqon doonto
She can do that.	Way samayn kartaa taas.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
I can tell she loves you	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inay ku jeceshahay
A new day.	Maalin cusub.
No one comes here, no one goes.	Qofna halkan ma yimaado, qofna ma tago.
I would like to know more about you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan kaa ogaado
I wanted to tell him	Waxaan rabay inaan u sheego
I hope she will see me again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay mar dambe i arki doonto
I never went that way.	Weligay sidaas uma aan bixin.
He is now one of us.	Hadda waa mid naga mid ah.
They will be.	Waxay ahaan doonaan.
Now it was an opportunity to say something.	Hadda waxay ahayd fursad wax lagu sheego.
He can go anywhere.	Meel kasta wuu tagi karaa.
It's a great place.	Waa meel aad u fiican.
Do not misunderstand me.	Ha i fahmin.
I don't seem to be able to.	Uma eka inaan awoodo.
That is,.	Taasi waa,.
I need to know he is fine	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inuu fiican yahay
They did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma ay sheegin.
It was small.	Waxay ahayd mid yar.
For him, that is a friend.	Isaga, taasi waa saaxiib.
I felt it, too.	Waxaan dareemay, sidoo kale.
I will not pay to see this.	Lacag ma bixin doono si aan tan u arko.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
That is what you would expect.	Taasi waa waxa aad filan lahayd.
He really did.	Run ahaantii wuu sameeyay.
But hardly anyone else.	Laakiin si dhib leh qof kale.
I felt for sure.	Waxaan dareemay hubaal.
I'm sorry, that's a terrible thing.	Waan ka xumahay, taasi waa wax aad u xun.
That is true to this day.	Taasi waa run ilaa maanta.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I would like to tell you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan u sheego.
Obviously that can happen.	Sida cad taasi way dhici kartaa.
Longer than most.	Ka dheer inta badan.
I could not believe he did that	Ma rumaysan karin inuu sidaas sameeyay
He would tell me if he had.	Wuu ii sheegi lahaa haddii uu leeyahay.
I do not want to do it again	Ma rabo inaan mar kale sameeyo
You are home again.	Guriga ayaad mar kale tahay.
Otherwise, it is the same.	Haddii kale, way la mid tahay.
I tried to do that.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan taas sameeyo.
But it will not be long.	Laakiin ma noqon doonto mid dheer.
I have seen and heard enough	Waxaan arkay oo maqlay in ku filan
Made by chance.	Lagu sameeyay fursad.
No one can do as he does.	Qofna ma samayn karo sida uu sameeyo.
I was surprised when someone loved me	Waxaan la yaabay marka qof i jecel yahay
I was really sorry yesterday	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay shalay
That is now.	Taasi waa hadda.
It was something new, it was something that had not been done.	Waxay ahayd wax cusub, waxay ahayd wax aan la samayn.
I was given all the money I owed	Waxa la i siiyay lacag dhan oo la igu leeyahay
I look beautiful, but that is a lie	Waxaan u muuqdaa mid qurux badan, laakiin taasi waa been
I just didn’t have enough food	Kaliya ma aan haysan cunto cunto
I wonder if he can even see	Waxaan la yaabanahay inuu xitaa arki karo
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I saw a man coming towards me	Waxaan arkay nin ii soo socda
The rest is the same.	Inta kale waa isku mid.
I am very happy to be a part of it.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ka mid noqdo.
But this is true.	Laakiin tani waa run.
I do not have it.	Aniga kuma hayo.
He is a real person.	Waa qof dhab ah.
Maybe I won't see him again	Malaha mar dambe ma arki doono
I wanted to know if you have an idea	Waxaan rabay in aan ogaado haddii aad fikrad leedahay
I had no idea they would be here today	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay halkan joogi doonaan maanta
They may not know you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ku garanayn.
That has been true so far.	Taasi run bay ahayd ilaa hadda.
That would be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u fiican.
I have an idea right now	Waxaan hayaa fikrad hadda
I took it all so badly	Waxaan u qaatay sida xun oo dhan
And more.	Iyo in ka badan.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
But it is not something he can do at work.	Laakiin ma aha wax uu ku qaban karo shaqo.
It was small.	Wax yar bay ahayd.
It was me and something else, something else	Waxaan ahaa aniga iyo wax kale, wax kale
I had no idea I was doing well for you	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaan si fiican kuu sameeyo
No one seems to be at home.	Qofna uma eka inuu guriga joogo.
I will do it for you.	Adiga ayaan kaa yeeli doonaa.
he said to himself	ayuu is yidhi
I got there	Halkaas ayaan ka helay
What it will be, it will be.	Maxay noqon doontaa, waxay noqon doontaa.
I would love to see it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko.
I quit my job a few years ago	Dhowr sano ka hor ayaan shaqada ka tagay
He should have been here.	Waxay ahayd inuu halkan joogo.
A little time.	Waqti yar.
It has already happened.	Hore ayuu u dhacay.
I can't tell him that	Taas uma sheegi karo isaga
I looked at it clearly	Maalin cad ayaan eegay
I was not the only one who felt that way	Anigu ma ahayn ka kaliya ee sidaas dareemay
They may be right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax yihiin.
Once again he got what he wanted.	Mar kale ayuu helay wixii uu rabay.
I thought it would help	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ku caawin doonto
I knew what he was doing	Waan ogaa waxa uu samaynayo
I would not say he is beautiful	Ma odhan lahaa wuu qurux badan yahay
This can really happen to anyone.	Tani waxay runtii ku dhici kartaa qof kasta.
Made later.	La sameeyay mar dambe.
That is not the case, he said.	Taasi maaha ayuu yidhi.
A lot.	Wax badan.
And so you know, it's amazing.	Oo sidaas aad ogtahay, waa yaab.
That was the only reason.	Sidaas oo kale ayaa ahayd sababta kaliya.
She realized she wasn't.	Way ogaatay in aanay ahayn.
I could not tell anyone	Qofna uma sheegi karin
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I really know that.	Runtii taas waan ogahay.
Now they had nothing.	Hadda waxba ma ay haysan.
Sida.	Sida.
I would come home	Waxaan ka iman lahaa guriga
I know, but it's good	Waan ogahay, laakiin wuu fiican yahay
It may be correct.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid sax ah.
But we do not.	Laakiin ma samayno.
I was really impressed	Runtii aad baan ula dhacay
Maybe I did the same	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyay
I did not see that coming	Ma aanan arag in soo socda
I actually left the room	Si dhab ah ayaan qolka uga baxay
Nothing big yet.	Weli wax weyn ma jiraan.
Here is another one.	Waa kan mid kale.
This was a long time coming.	Tani waxay ahayd wakhti dheer oo soo socda.
I wanted you to say so, as always	Waxaan rabay inaad sidaas u sheegto, sida had iyo jeer
I am ready for something new	Waxaan diyaar u ahay wax cusub
It can stay here.	Way joogi kartaa halkan.
There is a lot going on.	Wax badan baa meesha ku jira.
Maybe I have nothing against him	Malaha waxba ma hayo isaga
I did not know it could be needed	Maan ogayn in loo baahan karo
I found nothing else	Wax kale maan helin
I want to be there too, and soon	Waxaan rabaa sidoo kale halkaas, iyo dhawaan
I just don't think it will happen	Kaliya uma maleynayo inay dhici doonto
If you do, you can come back.	Haddii aad sidaas samayso, waad soo noqon kartaa.
I always know what they will say	Mar walba waan garanayaa waxay odhan doonaan
But he knew better.	Laakiin si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
I can't believe it would hurt.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu wax yeeli lahaa.
I have everything here	Wax walba halkan ayaan ku hayaa
As well as others.	Sidoo kale dadka kale.
I wondered what he would do	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu samayn doono
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
I would not have	Maan haysan lahaa
You are now.	Waxaad tahay hadda.
, each.	, mid kasta.
Only the best will do it.	Kaliya kan ugu fiican ayaa sameyn doona.
It was also a lie.	Sidoo kale been bay ahayd.
I did not know what to do	Ma garanayn waxa uu samayn doono
I came back.	waan soo noqday.
I have never seen him so bad	Weligay ma arag isaga oo xun
I really like that	Runtii waan jeclahay taas
This is not a bad idea.	Tani maaha fikrad xun.
I had no idea I was going to be a quick friend	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaan noqon doono saaxiibo degdeg ah
Something had to be done	Waxay ahayd in wax la sameeyo
I have another chance	Waxaan leeyahay fursad sii
I just want you to know it's not a big deal.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato inaysan wax weyn ahayn.
I did not know there was another	Maan ogayn inuu jiro mid kale
She did not want him.	Ma ay rabin isaga.
All he had to do was do it.	Waxa uu samayn lahaa waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
I thought you were someone else.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay qof kale.
You may also tell me what you did.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale ii sheegto waxa aad samaysay.
But that was a lot known.	Laakiin taas oo ahayd wax badan oo la yaqaan.
I hope that is right for everyone	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi ay sax u tahay qof walba
It could not be.	Ma ay noqon karin.
A lot is going on for you.	Wax badan ayaa kuu socda.
I wanted to talk to you first	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo marka hore
I heard that.	Taas waan maqlay.
I know what we can be	Waan ogahay waxa aan noqon karno
You are better than this.	Waad ka fiican tahay kan.
No wonder, really.	La yaab ma leh, runtii.
I just love you so much	Kaliya aad ayaan kuu jeclahay
No one wants it.	Qofna ma rabo.
But that is a problem.	Laakiin taasi waa dhibaato.
I need to do more	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan sameeyo
I didn't say anything.	Wax walba uma sheegin.
He asked me what he could do for me.	Waxa uu i waydiiyay waxa uu ii qaban karo.
This will be interesting.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
As it was.	Sidii ay ahayd.
No one knows everything.	Qofna wax walba ma yaqaan.
I know he still has it	Waan ogahay inuu weli hayo
I knew you would be alone	Waan ogaa inaad keligaa ahaan doonto
I have done this several times.	Waxaan tan sameeyay dhowr jeer.
I need a man like you	Waxaan u baahanahay nin kula mid ah
I have no idea what is going on there	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa halkaas ka jira
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I think he will probably stay there	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay u badan tahay inuu halkaas sii joogo
But for others it is the same.	Laakiin dadka kale waa sidaas oo kale.
He found time.	Waqti buu helay.
She had no idea she was doing that	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay taas samaynayso
You can do it.	Waad samayn kartaa.
But that was awful, you know.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wax aad u xun, waad ogtahay.
You did a good job.	Shaqo wanaagsan ayaad samaysay.
I can't talk to him right now	Ma la hadli karo isaga hadda
I hope it doesn't take long	Waxaan rajeynayaa in aysan qaadan waqti dheer
He is sure.	Wuu hubaa.
I knew what had happened to me	Waan ogaa waxa igu dhacay
I knew what would happen.	Waan ogaa waxa dhici doona.
That is, he did.	Taasi waa, wuu sameeyay.
I can't find a job	Ma heli karo shaqo
I know who he is now	Waan garanayaa qofka uu yahay hadda
He would not stop.	Ma uu joojin lahaa.
But that is what it is.	Laakiin waa waxa ay tahay.
Not spoken	Lama hadlin
I wonder how many other people live like that	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta qof ee kale ayaa sidaas u nool
But it is me.	Laakiin waa aniga.
he was not ready	diyaar uma ahayn
I hold you for a long time.	Waxaan ku hayaa waqti dheer.
Not sure	Ma hubo taas
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I am not ready for that	Taas diyaar uma ihi
I never knew that before	Weligay taas hore uma ogayn
I told her everything you told me	Wax walba oo aad ii sheegtay ayaan u sheegay
Both are the same.	Labaduba waa isku mid.
That's all.	Taasi waa dhan.
This is true now.	Tani waa dhab hadda.
I heard what you are doing	Waxaan maqlay waxaad samaynayso
Maybe I should, really	Malaha waa inaan, dhab ahaantii
I wanted to stay and help	Waxaan rabay inaan joogo oo aan caawiyo
I had to leave now	Waxay ahayd inaan hadda baxo
It is what you have.	Waa waxa aad leedahay.
I want to see you in a negative light	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko si xun
But most of the time he has other things to do.	Laakiin inta badan waxa uu leeyahay waxyaabo kale oo uu sameeyo.
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
They may not have spoken to us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan nala hadlin.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
There was not much time.	Ma jirin waqti badan.
No one seems to be happy to see us.	Qofna uma eka inuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu na arko.
I know why you are here	Waan ogahay sababta aad halkan u joogto
It may not even be desirable.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xitaa aan la rabin.
This was a busy time.	Tani waxay ahayd wakhti mashquul ah.
We were very good friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo aad u wanaagsan.
I wish I had a little more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto wax yar
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado.
bad day.	maalin xun.
There is no way we can do that.	Ma jirto si aan taas ku samayn karno.
I should have known it was really you	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inay dhab ahaan tahay adiga
I know you have the same problem	Waan ogahay in aad dhib isku mid ah leedahay
I just need to know why.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta.
I just have it	Kaliya waan hayaa
I have no help.	Wax caawin ah uma hayo.
Stop now.	Jooji hadda.
It may be correct.	Waxay noqon kartaa sax.
That is what it is called.	Taasi waa waxa loo yaqaan.
I can not say this enough	Ma sheegi karo tan in ku filan
I did not understand why he wanted me	Maan fahmin sababta uu ii rabo
I love helping people	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo dadka
I really hope you will too	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto
I may be able to do this	Waxa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan tan sameeyo
Not very interesting.	Ma aha mid aad u xiiso badan.
Still very difficult.	Weli aad u adag.
I found it to be very exciting	Waxaan u arkay inay tahay mid aad u faraxsan
I tried a lot.	Wax badan ayaa isku dayay.
But he had something.	Laakiin wax buu lahaa.
I need to find another job	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqo kale helo
I really know what you are doing	Runtii waan ogahay waxaad samaynayso
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan run ahayn.
He may not be back either now.	Ma laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale soo noqdo hadda.
It is not a new car.	Ma aha baabuur cusub.
It is the right thing to do.	Waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
I don't have a car now	Hadda maan haysan baabuur
That's right	Waa sax
I do not know what to do	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo
Today.	Maanta.
It looks right.	Waxay u egtahay sax.
I was really not ready	Runtii diyaar uma ahayn
There was nothing else.	Wax kale ma jirin.
I hope that will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay taasi caawin doonto.
It is difficult to do well	In si wanaagsan loo sameeyo waa adag tahay
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan.
Let him know.	Ha ogaado.
I have not seen many people.	Qof badan maan arag.
I have never left before	Weligay ka hor ma aan bixin
I know what you think of me.	Waan ogahay waxa aad aniga ila tahay.
There really is.	Waxaa jira runtii.
I do not know if this is a good idea or not.	Ma garanayo in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan iyo in kale.
As it was, it was lovely.	Sida ay ahayd, waxay ahayd mid la jecel yahay.
I can't talk to him	Ma la hadli karo isaga
I think they are great	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay weyn yihiin
I do not have to be here	Ma aha inaan halkan joogo
Just to talk.	Kaliya in la hadlo.
I know you can't love someone like me	Waan ogahay inaadan jeclaan karin qof aniga oo kale ah
I did not know what it would be like	Maan garanayn sida ay noqon doonto
He refused money.	Lacag buu diiday.
Maybe this, maybe.	Laga yaabaa in tani, laga yaabaa in.
That is not yet ready	Taasi wali diyaar uma aha
I wonder why.	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa.
Everyone has their time.	Qof walba waqti buu leeyahay.
I had no real friends	Maan lahayn saaxiibo run ah
He loves you.	Adiga wuu ku jecel yahay.
He tried to help	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu caawiyo
That is very bad.	Taasi aad bay u xun tahay.
What a great man.	Maxaa nin weyn.
I want something good tonight	Waxaan rabaa wax wanaagsan caawa
But really that is a good thing.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
It was something else.	Wax kale bay ahayd.
As good as it can be.	Sida ugu fiican inta ay noqon karto.
He said he would just see.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu kaliya arki lahaa.
He was in it.	Wuu ku jiray.
They live here.	Waxay ku nool yihiin halkan.
You will return.	Waad soo noqon doontaa.
I liked that.	Waan ka helay taas.
I did not know it was you	Maan garanayn inay adiga tahay
I did not give anything	Waxba maan siin
In fact, it was a little early.	Run ahaantii, waxa ay ahayd wax yar hore.
I'll see you soon	waan ku arki doonaa dhawaan
I had to find you	Waxay ahayd inaan ku helo
I make money	lacag baan sameeyaa
It is said to be very good.	Waxaa la sheegay in ay aad u fiican.
Not very sure	Aad uma hubo
Maybe I should do that.	Malaha waa inaan taas sameeyaa.
I may not see you again	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan mar dambe ku arag
I just did not know that someone else had come here	Kaliya maan ogeyn in qof kale uu halkan yimid
I have a lot of things to do	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo badan oo aan sameeyo
I have a busy day tomorrow	Waxaan leeyahay maalin mashquul ah berri
He was a handsome man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin qurux badan.
I just didn’t want him.	Kaliya ma rabin isaga.
I didn’t want to talk about it, either.	Ma aanan rabin inaan ka hadlo, xitaa.
A man like me who lives there, that is a thing	Nin aniga oo kale ah oo halkaas ku nool, taasi waa wax
I have not had a chance before	Mar hore fursad uma helin
But it is small.	Laakiin wuu yar yahay.
Now it was not the same	Hadda isku mid ma ahayn
Here I am.	Waa i kan.
I can help you with that	Waan kaa caawin karaa taas
I knew that one day it would come	Waan ogaa inay maalin iman doonto
Fortunately she did not come.	Nasiib bay ahayd in aanay iman.
Everyone told me I wanted money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu ii sheegay inaan lacag rabo.
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
He must go today.	Waa inuu maanta tago.
I did not go back.	Dib uma noqon.
I think it was right	Waxaan filayaa inay sax ahayd
I would say that	Taas ayaan u sheegi lahaa
I really didn't see one coming.	Runtii maan arag mid soo socda.
I just can't see.	Kaliya ma arki karo.
There was very little time.	Waxaa jiray waqti aad u yar.
Now he is afraid of us.	Hadda wuu naga baqayaa.
I knew what she could do.	Waan ogaa waxa ay sameyn karto.
I would like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa.
I hope everyone is happy.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu faraxsan yahay.
I need help	Waxaan u baahanahay caawin
Not much, you know.	Ma badna, waad ogtahay.
I think that's a good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan
But for others it is the same.	Laakiin dadka kale waa sidaas oo kale.
I have never seen him.	Weligay ma arag isaga.
I wanted to get to know you	Waxaan rabay inaan ku barto
I know everyone.	Waan ogahay qof walba.
Not to be caught doing it.	In aan lagu qaban samayn ma aha.
I think one of us is there	Waxaan qabaa in mid naga mid ah uu halkaas joogo
I just wanted to do this tonight	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo kan caawa
For me, I don't want to do that.	Aniga, ma rabo inaan taas sameeyo.
He appeared.	Wuu muuqday.
I wanted to see you.	Waxaan rabay inaan ku arko.
I wanted to get it.	Waxaan rabay in la helo.
Maybe that's why?	Ma laga yaabaa inay taasi tahay sababta?.
It has everything you need.	Waxay leedahay wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
I really don't feel it.	Runtii ma dareemayo.
This is to be expected.	Tani waa la filayaa.
I have more than enough to do	Waxaan hayaa wax ka badan oo igu filan oo aan sameeyo
I really know a man	Runtii waan garanayaa nin
I should not have been here.	Ma ahayn inaan halkan joogo.
I do	waan sameeyaa
This was untrue.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aan run ahayn.
I just stayed there.	Halkaas ayaan iska joogay.
I will not be able to help	Ma awoodi doono inaan caawiyo
Maybe you would even like it to be yours.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad xitaa jeclaan lahayd inay adiga tahay.
I want you to tell me everything	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax walba ii sheegto
I knew nothing else	Wax kale maan garanayn
I am not like that	Anigu sidaas oo kale ma ihi
He may have already left.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu hore u baxay.
I didn't know anyone.	Qofna maan garanayn.
Here, it is not.	Halkan, ma aha.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I know where it is	Waan ogahay meesha ay tahay
I want someone to tell me what to do.	Waxaan rabaa in qof ii sheego waxaan sameeyo.
I could not think of anything else	Wax kale uma malayn karin
He said it was enough.	Wuxuu yidhi waa ku filan.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
This can be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
Obviously, that was not true.	Sida cad, taasi run ma ahayn.
I'm not sure.	Ma hubo tan.
I don't know where to find it.	Ma garanayo meel aan ka helo.
But that doesn't matter.	Laakiin taasi waxba maaha.
I hope someone found it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu qof helay
Not much.	Ma badna.
I have something to say.	waxaan leeyahay wax aan sheego.
I knew this would take some work	Waan ogaa in tani ay qaadan doonto xoogaa shaqo ah
I have never seen him	Weligay ma arag isaga
I’ve never had that before.	Weligay taas hore uma helin.
I'll be back.	Dib ayaan ugu soo noqon doonaa.
But that would take us time.	Laakiin taasi waxay nagu qaadan lahayd waqti.
I made it work for him.	Waxaan ka dhigay inuu u shaqeeyo.
I think about that.	Waan ka qabaa taas.
I can do it again	Mar kale ayaan samayn karaa
Before he does, you should know about him.	Ka hor inta uusan samayn, waa in aad ka ogaato isaga.
he can succeed.	wuu guulaysan karaa.
As well as every man.	Sidoo kale nin walba.
Can you be better	Ma ka fiicnaan kartaa
Obviously we would like that.	Sida iska cad waan jeclaan lahayn taas.
I will stay there	halkaas ayaan joogi doonaa
I had to find something new that I now have	Waxay ahayd inaan helo wax cusub oo aan hadda helo
I just need some time	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa waqti ah
But she could not see anything.	Laakiin waxba ma ay arki karin.
Not much.	Wax badan kuma jiraan.
It has always been, probably always will be.	Had iyo jeer ahaa, malaha had iyo jeer way ahaan doontaa.
But you, well.	Laakiin adiga, si fiican.
Obviously this is nonsense.	Sida cad tani waa wax aan jirin.
He is not at home.	Ma joogo guriga.
I hurried out of the room	Degdeg ayaan qolka uga baxay
I’ll talk about that, among other things, today.	Waxaan ka hadli doonaa taas, iyo waxyaabo kale, maanta.
Today is a new day.	Maanta waa maalin cusub.
I'm just happy to have something	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan wax helo
It can happen anywhere and anytime.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa meel kasta iyo wakhti kasta.
It is even more interesting.	Waxaa ka sii xiiso badan.
Really good, too.	Dhab ahaantii wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
It was just what.	Waxay ahayd kaliya waxa.
I love working there	Waxaan jeclahay in aan halkaas ka shaqeeyo
There is nothing new about this.	Ma jiro wax ku cusub arrintan.
I have seen enough.	Wax igu filan ayaan arkay.
I need to be a good man	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan noqdo nin wanaagsan
And the person after.	Iyo qofka ka dib.
I know it has nothing to do with it	Waan ogahay in aanay wax shaqo ah ku lahayn
It can happen.	Way dhici kartaa.
I did not receive it.	Ima ay helin.
As he knew this, he could not say.	Sida uu taas u ogaa, ma uu odhan karin.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
I can do many things	Waxyaabo badan baan samayn karaa
I started working with him and working with him	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la shaqeeyo oo aan la shaqeeyo
Whatever it was, it was real.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd, dhab bay ahayd.
I know you have to do something fun.	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad sameyso wax xiiso leh.
I could not see what it was	Maan arki karin waxa ay tahay
I've got this for a while.	Waxaan tan helay in muddo ah.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
It wasn’t just beautiful.	Ma ahayn oo kaliya qurux.
I have no idea what it is.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay.
I hope there is food to eat	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay jirto cunto la cuno
Only that was not ready	Kaliya taas diyaar uma ahayn
There has never been a problem.	Waligiis wax dhib ah ma uusan jirin.
Please, do not.	Fadlan, ha samayn.
This really can't happen.	Tani dhab ahaantii ma dhici karto.
I have not spoken yet	Wali ma hadlin
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
But if someone wants to help that is fine.	Laakiin haddii qof doonayo inuu caawiyo taasi waa fiican tahay.
I put it there.	Halkaas ayaan dhigay.
I heard this with uncertainty.	Waxaan tan ku maqlay hubaal la'aan.
I wanted you to eat	Waxa aan rabay in aad wax cunto
It includes.	Waxaa ka mid ah.
Not much there.	Ma badna halkaas.
I am the one who should be here.	Anigu waxaan ahay kan ay tahay inuu halkan joogo.
I could do nothing for him	waxba uma qaban karin isaga
I thought it was weird	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay tahay yaab
I told you they are more	Waxaan kuu sheegay in ay ka badan yihiin
It's you.	Waa adiga.
That is true today.	Taasi waa run maanta.
I would love for her to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay sameyso
I will stay there again	Mar kale ayaan sii joogi doonaa halkaas
I didn't get much else	Wax badan oo kale maan helin
You must not lie.	Waa inaadan been sheegin.
He loves what he does.	Wuxuu jecel yahay wuxuu sameeyo.
I will not do that	Taas isaga ku samayn maayo
It was great.	Wax weyn bay ahayd.
One took to knowing one.	Mid u qaatay inuu ogaado mid.
He may have been robbed.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu la dhacay.
Now, more than ever.	Hadda, in ka badan sidii hore.
He had nothing to say.	Wax uu ka sheego ma jirin.
I did not know that anyone was there	Maan ogeyn in qofna uu halkaas joogo
But that was for the most part.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd inta badan.
I wonder what he wanted to talk about	Waxa aan la yaabanahay waxa uu rabay in uu ka hadlo
Everyone wants something new and fresh.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa wax cusub oo cusub.
I have to.	Waa inaan.
I tried again.	Mar kale ayaan isku dayay.
I love it otherwise.	Waan jeclahay haddii kale.
He is another bad guy.	Waa nin kale oo xun.
I will not even lie	Xitaa been cad ma sheegi doono
Very good indeed !.	Aad u fiican runtii!.
It will not be.	Ma ahaan doonto.
He said you are.	Wuxuu yidhi waad tahay.
I love working with you	Waan jeclahay inaan kula shaqeeyo
They will help each other.	Way is caawin doonaan.
I had to do that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas sameeyo
I hope so	Waxaan rajeynayaa
Maybe he thought he would be better than me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu u maleeyay inuu iga fiicnaan doono.
I found the main room	Waxaan helay qolka ugu weyn
I still can't see anyone	Wali qofna kama arki karo
I just tried to figure it out	Kaliya waxaan isku dayay inaan is ogaado
He was the only person there.	Waxa uu ahaa qofka kaliya ee halkaas.
You were everything to me.	Waxaad ii ahayd wax walba.
I looked closely	Si dhow ayaan u eegay
When I.	Markii aan.
It was placed there.	Halkaas ayaa la dhigay.
As if it really does.	Sida haddii ay runtii taas samaynayso.
I just didn’t have time.	Kaliya ma haysan waqti.
I did not want to do anything	Maan jeclayn inaan waxba sameeyo
I did not know how to take it	Maan garanayn sida ay u qaadan lahayd
You do not believe.	Ma aadan rumaysan.
He was tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag.
Nothing at present.	Wax la joogo ma jiro.
I can't say he was surprised	Ma odhan karo wuu la yaabay
I hope this will help	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay caawin doonto
I can't find much.	Wax badan kama heli karo.
I still do.	Wali waan sameeyaa.
No matter what I do.	Dhib malaha waxaan sameeyo.
It would be nice	Way fiicnaan lahayd
Sorry to leave you	Waan ka xumahay inaan kaa tago
I look forward to the following	Waxaan rajeynayaa waxa soo socda
I just do not know.	Kaliya ma garanayo.
I wanted to be with you	Waxaan rabay inaan kula joogo
I thought that was a little later	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay ahayd wax yar ka dib
It was a good idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I did nothing	waxba maan qaban
This was the reason.	Tani waxay ahayd sababta.
You are very good.	Aad baad u fiican.
Previously it was home.	Ka hore wuxuu ahaa guriga.
I don't think it will happen.	Uma maleynayo inay dhici doonto.
I love people.	Waxaan jeclahay dadka.
"I want to," he said	waan rabaa ayuu yiri
I can even say that here	Taas xitaa halkan ayaan ka sheegi karaa
He got an idea.	Wuxuu helay fikrad.
That can be time consuming.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa wakhti.
Good, you think.	Way fiican tahay, waxaad u malaynaysaa.
Here it is.	Hadda waa kan.
I can't help what happened before	Ma caawin karo wixii hore u dhacay
It is a huge problem.	Waa dhibaato aad u weyn.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I'm sorry I did	Waan ka xumahay inaan sameeyay
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani sax maaha.
It was not a beautiful place.	Ma ahayn meel qurux badan.
I think that is the best thing we can do	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay waxa ugu fiican ee aan sameyn karno
I just want to know what is going on there	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa halkaas ka socda
It doesn't have to be everywhere, all the time.	Ma aha inay tahay inay meel walba joogto, mar kasta.
If everyone sees.	Haddii qof walba arko.
I can say a lot	Wax badan ayaan odhan karaa
I asked him what he wanted	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu rabo
I really hope he does	Runtii waxaan filayaa inuu sameeyo
I am very happy there.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay halkaas.
It was what we could afford	Waxay ahayd waxa aan awoodi karno
I have not yet found it to do	Wali maan helin inaan sameeyo
I asked him what he would do.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu samayn doono.

I have something to tell you	wax aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa
I do not want an appointment	Ma rabin ballan

He felt good.	Wanaagsan ayuu dareemay.
I hope today is a good day for you	Waxaan rajeynayaa in maanta ay kuu tahay maalin wanaagsan

That cannot happen.	Taasi ma dhici karto.
Very difficult.	Mid aad u adag.
I do not know if he loves me or not	Ma garanayo inuu i jecel yahay iyo in kale

You should not have any trouble doing so.	Waa inaadan wax dhib ah ku helin inaad sidaas samayso.
I hope you are ready	Waxaan filayaa inaad diyaar u tahay
I really didn't want to talk to anyone	Runtii ma rabin inaan qof la hadlo
I have not been able to leave until today	Maan awoodin inaan baxo ilaa maanta
There is no other way.	Si kale oo loo sameeyo ma jirto.
I'm not sure if it's correct or not.	Ma hubo in uu sax yahay iyo in kale.
Let me just say it clearly.	Kaliya aan si cad u sheego.
I know you have not seen it	Waan ogahay inaadan arag
Maybe too long.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u dheer.
I can't see the past	Ma arki karo wixii tagay
It can take time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
I think he is a good person.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu yahay qof wanaagsan.
They are so amazing.	Aad bay u yaab badan yihiin.
More work is still needed.	Shaqo badan ayaa weli loo baahan yahay.
They are very difficult.	Aad bay u adag yihiin.
There is more, too.	Waxaa jira in ka badan, sidoo kale.
I don't know anyone very well	Qofna si dhib ah uma garanayo
It really didn't matter.	Runtii dhib ma lahayn.
I can tell you it was a bit of a chore	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa inay ahayd xoogaa shaqo ah
I say so.	Waxaan leeyahay sidaas.
I do not think it is	U malayn maayo inay tahay
It is enough for me.	Way igu filan tahay aniga.
I need to.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan.
He must also have done so.	Waa sidoo kale in uu sidaas sameeyay.
I'm sure he's fine.	Waan hubaa inuu fiican yahay.
I would see you	waan ku arki lahaa
Lots of food.	Cunto badan.
He said there were things he could not tell.	Wuxuu sheegay inay jiraan waxyaabo uusan u sheegi karin.
I will not do anything against you	waxba ku samayn maayo
It took a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaa qaatay.
We will talk.	Waan wada hadli doonaa.
This is too.	Tani waa sidoo kale.
I should not have left you	Ma ahayn inaan kaa tago
I knew he was fine	Waan ogaa inuu fiican yahay
I can't see anything	Waxba ma arko
I really wanted to	Aad baan u rabay
I didn’t want to do it with him	Ma aanan rabin in aan ku sameeyo isaga

It was a great idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad fiican.
I just have to	Kaliya waa inaan aniga ahay
I would love to see you again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale arko
It is really beautiful.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Would pay.	Bixin lahaa.
This is great.	Waa tan weyn.
I will not say anything about it	Waxba ka odhan maayo
I saw what was going on	Waxaan arkay waxa meesha ka socda
I could not have imagined that	Maan u malayn karin sidaas
Soon you will be doing a lot of things on your own.	Mar dhow waxaad samayn doontaa waxyaabo badan oo badan adiga keligaa.
It really is true.	Runtii waa run.
Obviously you want to be here.	Sida iska cad inaad rabto inaad halkan joogto.
It's a little bit.	Waa wax yar.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
It was a day.	Waxay ahayd maalin.
I really have to go	Runtii waa inaan tago
Where she is.	Halka ay joogto.
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira badan.
I will never do that	Weligay sidaas ma yeeli doono
He came back to help.	Wuxuu u soo noqday inuu caawiyo.
Tomorrow can be a difficult day.	Berrito waxay noqon kartaa maalin adag.

He is very smart.	Aad buu u caqli badan yahay.
me.	aniga .
I can stay there doing something	Waxaan joogi karaa halkaas oo aan wax samaynayo
I just did not know how	Kaliya maan garanayn sida
It was definitely a long day.	Hubaal waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
Even if they are many, very, very many.	Xitaa haddii ay badan yihiin, aad iyo aad u badan yihiin.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I knew they hadn't been here for a long time	Waan ogaa in aanay halkan joogin wakhti dheer
It was as good as any.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan sida mid kasta.
It is difficult to know for sure.	Way adag tahay in si hubaal ah loo ogaado.
I hope you will not be there.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaadan halkaas joogi doonin.
That was really something.	Taasi runtii wax bay ahayd.
I really am	Runtii dhab baan ahay
I wanted you to be with him	Waxaan rabay inaad isaga la joogto
I was lucky he found me.	Nasiib ayaan lahaa wuu i helay.
In less than a year.	In ka yar hal sano.
It will be better there.	Halkaas bay ku fiicnaan doontaa.
I know it's a tough place.	Waan ogahay inay tahay meel adag.
She said no.	Waxay sheegtay inaysan jirin.
I never thought of that	Weligay uma malaynayn taas
It is a problem now.	Waa dhibaato hadda.
It is what you did.	Waa waxa aad samaysay.
I hope that is somewhat helpful	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi ay tahay wax xoogaa caawin ah
I do not want this clearly.	Ma rabo si cad tan.
I can't give you anything	waxba kuma siin karo
I do this regularly.	Si joogto ah ayaan tan u sameeyaa.
No one can fall.	Qofna ma soo dhici karo.
He disappeared one day.	Maalin ayuu la waayay.
She was a real person every time she told me.	Waxay ahayd qof dhab ah mar kasta oo ay ii sheegto.
He came back to me.	Wuu igu soo noqday.
I was not there the day before	Maan joogin maalin hore
I need time	waqti ayaan rabaa
This will not say anything, no one.	Tan waxba kama odhan doono, qofna.
I looked at it once	Mar baan ku eegay
I just want to do everything.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax walba.
Someone was here.	Qof baa halkan joogay.
I just don't know yet	Kaliya maan garanayn weli
Maybe I have an idea of ​​who did this	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan fikrad ka haysto cidda tan samaysay
Mostly.	Inta ugu badan.
I could not do that.	Taas ma yeeli karin.
Every day.	Maalin kasta.
You know you will.	Waad ogtahay inaad yeeli doonto.
I haven't seen it much.	In badan maan arag.
he would be fine	wuu fiicnaan lahaa
I thought it was the best	Waxaan u maleeyay sida ugu fiican
But everyone else liked it	Laakiin qof kasta oo kale ayaa ka helay
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
Everyone was there.	Qof kasta oo halkaas joogay.
That is what you will do.	Taasi waa waxa aad sameyn doonto.
He couldn't help it.	Wuu caawin waayay.
I will only do that.	Kaliya sidaas ayaan sameyn doonaa.
I was there for a while	Wax yar ayaan joogay
Maybe I don't mind	Malaha waxba ma qabo
Too much money	Lacag aad u badan
I would like a friend	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa saaxiib
Much has been seen to this day.	Wax badan la arkay ilaa maanta.
I thought that was beautiful, too	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi aad u qurux badan, sidoo kale
He was right.	Run buu sheegay.
I love that you want to do this	Waxaan jeclahay inaad rabto inaad tan sameyso
I think you know.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad ogtahay.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
But all a good time.	Laakiin dhammaan waqti fiican.
It will be as it was, but better.	Waxay ahaan doontaa sidii ay ahayd, laakiin ka sii fiican.
No one does.	Qofna ma sameeyo.
It wasn’t the same thing.	Ma ahayn wax la mid ah.
He lives here.	Halkan ayuu ku nool yahay.
He did not lie	Been uma sheegin
I just did not know where that could be	Kaliya maan garanayn meesha ay taasi noqon karto
Pick us up.	Na soo qaado.
Do not think so.	Ha u malayn taas.
I have never been lucky	Weligay nasiib uma helin
I'm sure of that, too	Waan hubaa taas, sidoo kale
I hope you can find it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad heli karto.
Elsewhere it will not be a big deal.	Meel kasta oo kale ma noqon doonto wax weyn.
I can do it in time	Waxaan sameyn karaa waqti
I thought she would like me	Waxaan u maleeyay inay i jeclaan lahayd

I thought you liked me	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad i jeceshahay
I want you to be with me	Waxaan rabaa inaad rabto inaad ila joogto
Do not find it anywhere else.	Meel kale ha ka helin.
I will catch you soon	waan ku soo qaban doonaa dhawaan
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
I saw it today.	maanta ayaan arkay.
I have never found one.	Weligay mid maan helin.
He is back to me now.	Hadda ayuu igu soo noqday.
He seemed to be.	U muuqday inuu yahay.
He wants to go home	Wuxuu rabaa inuu guriga aado
Until recently.	Ilaa wakhti dhow.
Sure, it can be complicated.	Hubaal, waxay noqon kartaa dhib badan.
I would do the same	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax la mid ah
I really liked him	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga
That is what it should do.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay inay sameyso.
Not yet.	Ma aha ilaa hadda.
I really want to talk to you	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
He did not like to be lied to.	Ma jeclayn in been loo sheego.
They will do whatever you want.	Waxay sameyn doonaan wax kasta oo aad rabto.
What a lucky, lucky man.	Maxaa nin nasiib badan, nasiib badan.
What a terrible thing.	Waa maxay wax aad u xun.
I think you did what you were supposed to do	Waxaan filayaa in aad samaysay waxa ay ahayd in aad samayso
Someone may pick us up soon.	Qof ayaa laga yaabaa inuu dhawaan na soo qaado.
That will come.	Taasi way iman doontaa.
I'm really sorry you did this and that	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay inaad samaysay sidaas iyo sidaas
I have no problem seeing it again	Wax dhib ah kama qabo inaan mar kale arko mar kale
He may talk about everything that has happened.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu kala hadlo wax walba oo dhacay.
I looked at everything	Wax walba waan eegay
And, there was something else.	Oo, wax kale ayaa jiray.
It will be seen	Waa la arki doonaa
I love it so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay
Another new one.	Mid kale oo cusub.
Maybe I went there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan halkaas aaday.
He was a young man.	Nin yar ayuu ahaa.
I think you are also very surprised.	Waxaan filayaa inaad sidoo kale aad u yaab badan tahay.
I thought that was great	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi aad u fiican tahay
I want to know what is going on	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa socda
I could not tell him what to do	Waxa aan sameeyo ayaan u sheegi waayay
Now she can go to work.	Hadda waxay aadi kartaa shaqada.
Once you told me they do everything.	Mar waxaad ii sheegtay in wax walba ay sameeyaan.
If he were here now, he would expect something later.	Haddii uu hadda joogo, wax ka dib ayuu wax ka filan lahaa.
But don't tell me you love him.	Laakiin ha ii sheegin inaad isaga jeceshahay.
It needs to be known.	Waxay u baahan tahay in la ogaado.
I tried to tell them what had happened	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u sheego waxa dhacay
I have to see it every day	Waa inaan maalin walba arko
And he gets time.	Oo waqti uu helo.
A man thought.	Nin baa mooday.
I have never seen it	Weligay ma arag
I know this will not stop you.	Waan ogahay in tani aysan ku joojin doonin.
This is the most obvious.	Tani waa tan ugu cad.
I did not say it correctly	Si sax ah uma sheegin
You would not be here if you had stayed.	Halkan ma aad joogi lahayd haddii aad joogi lahayd.
I just wanted to.	Kaliya waxaan rabay.
I felt we were all good	Waxa aan dareemay in aanu wada wanaagsan nahay
I had to do something all the time	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sameeyo mar kasta
I can't take this anymore	Ma qaadan karo tan mar dambe
He is somewhere.	Meel buu joogaa.
I wondered where she was now.	Waxaan la yaabay halka ay hadda joogto.
I want you to know that	Waxaan rabaa inaad taas ogaato
I found something else	Wax kale ayaan helay
You will find someone better.	Waxaad heli doontaa qof ka wanaagsan.
I am not very sure of that.	Aad uma hubo taas.

I want to talk to you in person.	Waxaan rabaa inaan qof ahaan kula hadlo.
I can't go there	Ma tagi karo halkaas
They had to do everything right.	Waxay ahayd inay wax walba si sax ah u sameeyaan.
I have not been close	Uma aan dhawaan
We love him.	Waanu jeclayn isaga.
No one will find you.	Qof ku heli maayo.
I should have seen the following	Waxay ahayd inaan arko soo socda
You must not tell anyone.	Waa inaadan cidna u sheegin.
It is something you should have mentioned earlier.	Waa wax ay ahayd inaad hore u soo sheegto.
It was a terrible place.	Waxay ahayd meel aad u xun.
I did not say that.	Taas uma sheegin.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah malaha.
But she would come back.	Laakiin way soo noqon lahayd.
I have to leave for sure	Waa inaan iska tago si hubaal ah
He should not.	Ma ahayn inuu.
He could not go today.	Maanta wuu tagi waayay.
Probably the best.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ugu wanaagsan tahay.
So he made money.	Sidaas ayuu lacag ku helay.
Good day job.	Shaqo maalin wanaagsan.
I say both are bad.	Waxaan leeyahay labaduba waa xun yihiin.
I know what needs to be done	Waan ogahay waxa loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo
I knew nothing about him	Waxba kama garanayn isaga
I really enjoyed being with one man	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay, inaan hal nin la joogo
No one knew, no one wanted to know.	Qofna ma ogayn, qofna ma doonayn inuu ogaado.
She says that's why she's here.	Waxay sheegtay inay tahay sababta ay halkan u joogto.
I had a good time there	Waqti fiican ayaan ku qaatay halkaas
I did not want this but you are now	kan kuma rabin laakiin hadda waad tahay
I very much doubt it will happen now or not	Waxaan aad uga shakisanahay inay hadda dhici doonto iyo in kale
Same every day.	Maalin kasta isku mid.
I still don't see anything.	Wali waxba ma arko.
I had to keep him with me.	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga ila hayo.
In fact, it is better when you are alone.	Dhab ahaantii, way ka fiican tahay marka aad keligaa tahay.
I need to learn how.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan barto sida.
I knew something was coming, a great thing	Waxaan ogaa wax soo socda, wax weyn
I spent a lot of time on that.	Waqti badan ayaan ku qaatay taas.
I liked how she did it	Waxaan ka helay sida ay sidaas u samaysay
No one else is here.	Ma jiro qof kale halkan.
I knew better	Si ka fiican ayaan u ogaa
He must have time.	Waa inuu waqti helo.
I have been there for over a year now	Waxa aan joogay in ka badan hal sano hadda
I would like him to go home.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu guriga aado.
I would do nothing for it	Waxba waan u qaban lahaa
It was a difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag.
I just did not know how to do it	Kaliya maan garanayn sida loo sameeyo
I hope you will be here	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad halkaan joogi doonto
I hold myself a little	In yar ayaan isku hayaa
There is no urgency	Wax degdeg ah kuma jiro
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
I hope you like it	Waxaan filayaa inaad jeclaan doonto
I think everyone is ready to do new things.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu diyaar u yahay inuu sameeyo waxyaabo cusub.
I can not be as it was	Kuma noqon karo sidii ay ahayd
I could not figure out why	Waan awoodi waayay inaan ogaado sababta
I had to go to him first	Waxay ahayd in aan marka hore u tago isaga
It looks very complex and real.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u adag oo dhab ah.
I have to know what she told me	Waa inaan ogaado waxay ii sheegtay
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad.
I got one	mid baan helay
This is difficult for everyone.	Tani waa ku adag tahay qof walba.
I do not want to talk about it	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo
I heard you.	Waa ku maqlay.
I just want to learn	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan barto
I wish she was here now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay halkan joogto hadda
I just need a few good friends.	Waxaan kaliya u baahanahay dhowr saaxiibo oo wanaagsan.
I will be great friends again.	Waxaan noqon doonaa saaxiibo weyn mar kale.
She said to me once.	Waxay igu tidhi hal mar.
Nice to see you there	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaas ku arko
I want it all, you know? 	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan, ma ogtahay?
he said	ayuu yidhi
That I saw.	In aan arkay.
He wanted to, it was there.	Wuu rabay, halkaas bay ahayd.
I know what you like	Waan ogahay waxaad jeceshahay
I know a few of them	Waan garanayaa dhowr ka mid ah
I will not do that again	Taas mar kale ma yeeli doono
In fact, they are small.	Run ahaantii, way yar yihiin.
I have a good friend	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiib wanaagsan
She can do it now.	Hadda way samayn kartaa.
We would do it now.	Waxaan sameyn lahayn hadda.
I am not a person.	Anigu ma ihi qof.
We are very happy to be with you.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaad nala joogto.
I need to know it all	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wada ogaado
Not sure what it is	Ma hubo waxa ay tahay
It was new, it wasn't so bad.	Waxay ahayd cusub, ma ahayn sidaas u xun.
I think.	Waxaan filayaa.
I was ready for anything	Wax walba diyaar ayaan u ahaa
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
I can't believe no one will help	Ma rumaysan karo qofna ma caawin doono
I can only let you do a little better.	Waxaan kaliya kuu ogolaan karaa inaad sameyso xoogaa ka wanaagsan.
I know he loves you	Waan ogahay inuu ku jecel yahay
I am very happy that he is doing well.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inuu si fiican u shaqeeyo.
I don't want to see you.	Ma rabo inaan ku arko.
There was not much to pick up.	Ma jirin wax badan oo la soo qaado.
I just do this to help you.	Waxa kaliya oo aan tan u sameeyaa in aan ku caawiyo.
I have never even had a chance.	Weligay xitaa fursad ma helin.
Everyone came for it.	Qof walba ayaa u yimid.
I did not want to be anywhere else.	Ma rabin in aan meel kale joogo.
Give it to me once.	I sii hal mar.
I can be invisible.	Waxaan noqon karaa mid aan la arki karin.
Mar.	Mar.
But that would be a bit of a stretch.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahaan lahayd xoogaa badan.
Quick enough, but not too fast.	Si degdeg ah ugu filan, laakiin aan si degdeg ah.
I always got a lot of things	Had iyo jeer waxaan heli jiray waxyaabo badan
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
I have to keep it all together	Waa inaan wada hayaa
There is no one like him.	Ma jiro qof isaga la mid ah.
It is much more difficult.	Aad bay uga sii adag tahay.
I really didn't have a place to go	Runtii meel aan aado maan helin
This alone can not help	Kaliya tan kuma caawin karo
I looked back at the door	Albaabka ayaan dib u eegay
And something else, something else.	Iyo wax kale, wax kale.
Somewhere not here	Meel aan halkan joogin
I can go a little	Wax yar ayaan aadi karaa
I just have to leave	Kaliya waa inaan baxo
I just tried that but was unlucky.	Kaliya taas ayaan isku dayay laakiin nasiib ma leh.
Still very good.	Weli aad u fiican.
But one must be enough.	Laakiin mid waa inuu ku filan yahay.
That is not what we do.	Taasi maaha waxa aan samayno.
They must love him.	Waa inay jecel yihiin isaga.
I hope we can still be friends	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan wali saaxiibo noqon karno
It can be even worse.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad uga xun.
I just want everyone to leave me alone	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in qof walba uu iga tago keligiis
I found something for you	wax baan kuu helay
I'm sorry to tell you this.	Waan ka xumahay inaan tan kuu sheego.
She had to.	Waxay ahayd inay.
I am no longer a man	Anigu nin dambe ma ihi
Both are very good.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I have no idea what happened to him.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay.
I can't say what it really is	Ma sheegi karo waxa ay dhab ahaantii tahay
This is good.	Tani way wanaagsan tahay.
He went out again.	Mar kale ayuu baxay.
Please do not take it seriously	Fadlan si dhab ah ha u qaadan
I want to go home	Waxaan rabaa inaan tago guriga
It really looks like everyone has had a good time.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay in qof walba uu waqti fiican qaatay.
I knew she did.	Waan ogaa inay samaysay.
Sorry, he did not	Waan ka xumahay, ma uu samayn
I hope you know that	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas ogtahay
She will be able to help you.	Waxay awoodi doontaa inay ku caawiso.
Maybe it's a lie.	Malaha waa been.
I am here if you need anything.	Waxaan halkaan u joogaa haddii aad u baahan tahay wax.
I should have been here for him	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaan u joogo isaga
We were the others there.	Waxaan ahayn dadka kale ee halkaas joogay.
','.	','.
I want to do it again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale sameeyo
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
Much less.	Wax aad uga yar.
Every time.	Mar walba.
It doesn't matter to me.	Aniga waxba igama aha.
I got that from you	Taas ayaan kaa helay
In fact, there is not much to say.	Run ahaantii, ma jiraan wax badan oo la sheego.
I knew it was real.	Waan ogaa inay dhab tahay.
I do not want to do anything with you	Ma doonayo inaan waxba kula sameeyo
I'm not talking about it now.	Ka hadli maayo hadda.
I felt something was wrong	Waxaan dareemay wax aan sax ahayn
I still do not know what will happen to me and what will not happen.	Wali ma garanayo waxa igu dhici doona iyo waxa aan dhici doonin.
She told him she didn't have to.	Waxay u sheegtay in aanay lahayn.
I just hope it is	Kaliya waxaan rajeynayaa inay tahay
I think that is what he wants.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay waxa uu rabo.
We would not allow her to do this	Uma ogolaan lahayn inay tan samayso
I had nothing to do with it today	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn maanta
Maybe he saw it all the time.	Malaha wuu arki jiray mar walba.
I just want to leave	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
And maybe something better would come out of it.	Oo malaha wax ka wanaagsan ayaa ka soo bixi lahaa.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I picked it up from work	Waxaan ka soo qaaday shaqada
That is very difficult.	Taasi waa mid aad u adag.
I decided not to tell him	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan isaga u sheegin
He knew it was a bad day.	Wuu ogaa inay ahayd maalin xun.
Otherwise, nothing will be done.	Haddii kale, waxba lama qaban doono.
Give me another.	Mid kale i sii.
I'm sure that's right	Waxaan hubaa inay taasi sax tahay
That will get you now.	Taasi way ku heli doontaa hadda.
That was interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
I am so glad you are here !.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad halkaan joogto!.
It had nothing to do with it.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn.
I will not lie to you.	Been kuu sheegi maayo.
It went like that.	U baxay sidaas oo kale.
It can take a very long time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti aad u dheer.
There is no problem here.	Halkan wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
I'm right, they said.	run baan ahay, ayaa la yidhi.
I saw you.	waan ku arkay.
I know you do not understand	Waan ogahay inaadan fahmin
But it was the best thing he could do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan ee uu samayn karo.
I suspect it is.	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inay tahay.
I looked so bad.	Waxaan u muuqday mid aad u xun.
One day he disappeared.	Maalin ayaa la waayay.
Don't get too close	Aad ha ugu dhawaan
I found	waan helay
That was really good.	Taasi runtii waxay ahayd mid fiican.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I was supposed to be here	Waxaa la i rabay inaan halkaan joogo
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
I want to be like him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo isaga oo kale.
He did not come home.	Guriga uma iman.
I think that would be a good idea	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fikrad wanaagsan noqon lahayd
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan ku caawiyo
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
I can see how he says it	Waan arki karaa sida uu u sheego
There are so many of us.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo naga mid ah.
I think people are amazed at how good he is	Waxaan filayaa inuu dadka la yaabay sida uu u wanaagsan yahay
I did not do that	Anigu taas maan samayn
As you said.	Sida aad sheegtay.
Maybe you like him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad jeceshahay isaga.
I have told you many things	Wax badan baan kuu sheegay
She said it would be only one year.	Waxay sheegtay inay noqon doonto hal sano oo kaliya.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
I would like to know why	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sababta
I hope to see you again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko
That is what you need to do and you need to stay longer.	Taasi waa inaad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso oo aad u baahan tahay inaad waqti dheer sii joogto.
No more problems.	Dhib dambe ma lahayn.
I still wanted to do it	Weli waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo
I did not want to go there	Ma rabin in aan aado halkaas
I think she likes me	Waxaan filayaa inay i jeceshahay
He became a very loving man.	Waxa uu noqday nin aad u jecel.
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
I can really tell you	Runtii waan kuu sheegi karaa
This is not very good.	Tani maaha mid aad u fiican.
But they are all the same.	Laakiin dhammaan waa isku mid .
He was not present	Ma joogin
.	.
I found it to be very good	Waxaan u arkay inuu aad u fiican yahay
Great place for that	Meel aad u weyn taas
A lot.	Wax badan.
I didn't know what to do.	Wax aan ku sameeyo maan garanayn.
It came in a little bit to me.	Wax yar ayuu iga soo galay.
That would not do.	Taas ma yeeli lahayn.
I do not understand very well	Aad uma fahmin
You will stay now.	Hadda waad joogi doontaa.
Probably someone else.	Malaha qof kale.
It was felt.	Waa la dareemay.
I asked to be friends	Waxaan ka codsaday in aan saaxiibo
I know what it is now.	Waan ogahay waxa ay tahay hadda.
It is probably still true today.	Waxay u badan tahay inay weli run tahay maanta.
I can only do so much now	Kaliya wax badan ayaan sameyn karaa hadda
There was so much to do, so much to discover.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo la samayn lahaa, oo aad u badan si loo ogaado.
The reason for this is unknown.	Sababta arrintan ayaan la garanayn.
You will	Waad sameyn doontaa
He opened the front door.	Albaabka hore ayuu ka kala baxay.
I really wanted to	Aad ayaan u rabay
I found him.	Waa helay isaga.
There was something else he wanted.	Wax kale oo uu rabay ayaa jiray.
I really want to know who she is	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda ay tahay
I think that is enough	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ku filan tahay
Probably not much.	Malaha wax badan ma noqon doonto.
But I can't do it.	Laakiin ma awoodo inaan sameeyo.
It can be great !.	Way fiicnaan kartaa!.
He had to come out.	Waxay ahayd inuu ka soo baxo.
No one came.	Qofna halkaas ma iman.
I did not want to talk about this	Ma aanan rabin inaan ka hadlo arrintan
He knows what is coming.	Waxa soo socda wuu garanayaa.
I have never seen a man like him	Weligay maan arag nin la mid ah
They are happy with each other.	Way isku faraxsan yihiin.
This has and is done.	Tani waxay leedahay oo waa la sameeyaa.
For one, he did not have to leave home.	Mid ka mid ah, ma ahayn inuu guriga ka baxo.
No one gave me anything.	Qofna waxba ima siin.
I know that.	Waan ogahay taas.
I came in to see what happened to you	Waxaan u soo galay inaan arko waxa kugu dhacay
You can still do it now.	Weli waad samayn kartaa hadda.
I know that for sure	Waan ogahay taas hubaal
He is very good.	Aad buu u fiican yahay.
I did not want anyone to know	Ma rabin in qofna wax ogaado
He just did.	Kaliya wuu sameeyay.
He wanted me here.	Wuu i rabay halkan.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
I did not like school	Maan jeclayn dugsiga
I should be able to go there the day after tomorrow	Waa inaan awoodo inaan halkaas tago maalin ka dib berri
I'm really a big man	Runtii waxaan ahay nin weyn
I know him.	Waan garanayaa isaga.
I just took it.	Kaliya waan u qaatay.
I was amazed at how beautiful she was personally.	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay u qurux badan tahay qof ahaan.
A man came into the room	Nin baa qolka soo galay
That was so beautiful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
But like, good surprise.	Laakiin sida, yaab wanaagsan.
I want you, only you	waan ku rabaa adiga, adiga kaliya
I can't find her to tell me anything else.	Ma heli karo inay wax kale ii sheegto.
I need you one more time	Waxaan kuu baahanahay hal mar oo kale
That is very good.	Taasi waa mid aad u fiican.
They will not do this.	Tani ma samayn doonaan.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inaan dhib ka hadlo.
I will talk more about him again	Mar kale ayaan wax badan ka hadli doonaa isaga
found	helay
But there is something you need to know.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ay tahay inaad ogaato.
He still felt it.	Weli wuu dareemay.
I wonder if that is true	Waxaan la yaabanahay in taasi run tahay
I really liked that better	Runtii taas waan ka helay si ka sii fiican
It may have been at the same time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay isku mar ahayd.
I really liked him	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga
Are you ready?	diyaar ma u tahay?.
I knew it wasn't really	Waan ogaa in aysan run ahaantii ahayn
Really, it was really good for us.	Runtii, runtii wax wanaagsan bay noo ahayd.
Indeed, that is.	Runtii, taasi waa.
That is really difficult.	Taasi runtii waa adag tahay.
It can come back.	Way soo noqon kartaa.
Everyone will do it.	Nin walba wuu yeeli doonaa.
What happened was true.	Waxa dhacay run bay ahayd.
He was like someone else.	Wuxuu ahaa sida qof kale.
He asked me to go and see.	Wuxuu iga codsaday inaan tago oo aan arko.
so I was rejected.	sidaas ayaa la ii diiday.
I had to tell him to go	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego inuu tago
You are good, right.	Waad fiican tahay, sax.
It may not even be true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa inaysan run ahayn.
It will require a lot of money and hard work.	Waxay u baahan doontaa lacag badan iyo shaqo adag.
I told her it was.	Waxaan u sheegay inay tahay.
I love it here too	Waan jeclahay halkan sidoo kale
That's what everyone does.	Taasi waxa qof walba sameeyo.
Now it is one.	Hadda waa mid.
Everyone has money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u joogaa lacag.
I know you want what is best for me	Waan ogahay inaad rabto waxa aniga ii wanaagsan
We will not just be caught.	Kaliya nala qaban maayo.
But he liked it.	Laakiin wuu ka helay.
I felt he had done this before.	Waxa aan dareemay in uu tan hore u sameeyay.
I want to work to be a better person	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka shaqeeyo inaan noqdo qof wanaagsan
I really want to be his friend	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiib u noqdo
This was done for me.	Tani waa la igu sameeyay.
We can't come out.	Ma soo bixi karno.
I have rich friends	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo lacag leh
You know if you are.	Waad ogtahay haddii aad tahay.
I can talk about him.	Waan ka hadli karaa isaga.
Do they make good food?	Cunto fiican ma sameeyaan?.
I really should have known.	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
I told him what you did yesterday	Waxaan u sheegay wixii aad shalay samaysay
I do not like it a little	Ma jecli in yar
It really is.	Runtii waa.
That has always been a favorite.	Taasi had iyo jeer waxay ahayd mid la jecel yahay.
After a while, he tried.	Waqti ka dib, wuu isku dayay.
Idont want.	Ma doonayo.
Soon.	Dhawaan.
I want to be with you always	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar walba kula joogo
How is that true today?	Sidee taasi run tahay maanta?.
I would do anything for him	Wax kasta waan u samayn lahaa isaga
You will get a lot.	Waxaad heli doontaa wax badan.
He was a little cute !.	Wuxuu ahaa mid yar oo qurux badan!.
Take it now.	Hadda qaado.
You could do whatever you wanted.	Waxaad samayn lahayd wax kasta oo aad rabto.
They really are.	Runtii way jiraan.
I can't see very well	Si fiican uma arki karo
I am a little busy now	Waxaan ahay wax yar mashquul hadda
Maybe later.	Malaha mar dambe.
I tried to leave the house	Waxaan isku dayay inaan guriga ka baxo
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
I want everything	Waxaan ku rabaa wax walba
Mostly this is true.	Inta badan tani waa run.
But they did not do this.	Laakiin ma aysan qaban kan.
He must have time.	Waa inuu waqti helo.
But not so elsewhere.	Laakiin maaha sidaas meel kale.
I would like you to tell me what to expect	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad ii sheegto waxaad filan karto
But only there.	Laakiin halkaas oo kaliya.
Now I can do no less	Hadda wax ka yar ma samayn karo
I didn't even understand.	Xitaa ma fahmin.
malaha.	malaha.
Nothing.	Waxba kama jiraan.
I left yesterday	Shalay ayaan ka tagay
I will help	waan caawin doonaa
I really want to know	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
I was there for a year	Hal sano ayaan joogay halkaas
Not as before.	Ma aha sidii hore.
I could not believe it was true	Ma rumaysan karin inay run tahay
It was right.	Waxay ahayd mid sax ah.
I was, too.	Waxaan ahaa, sidoo kale.
I have to do this several times	Waa inaan taas sameeyaa dhowr jeer
I would like her to know how to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay ogaato sida loo sameeyo
It will not be	Ma ahaan doono
It will be a very long day.	Waxay noqon doontaa maalin aad u dheer.
I really want to help	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
I owe you everything	Wax walba waan kugu leeyahay
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
I hope everyone is.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba yahay.
I can't see anything	Waxba ma arko
Probably, it is known.	Malaha, waa la yaqaan.
It may be small, but it is hard.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu yar yahay, laakiin wuu adag yahay.
I got nothing.	Waxba ma helin.
In fact, very close to home.	Dhab ahaantii, aad ugu dhow guriga.
I think we can do that	Waxaan filayaa inaan taas samayn karno
It really is a great job.	Runtii waa shaqo aad u wanaagsan.
I want to tell you something.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax kuu sheego.
I tried again.	Mar kale ayaan isku dayay.
I know what it is.	Waan ogahay waxa uu yahay.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
That was true.	Taas oo run ahayd.
Well done, me.	Si fiican loo sameeyay, aniga.
Several others came in	Dhowr qof oo kale ayaa soo galay
I'm glad she's happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay faraxsan tahay.
It's too long	Aad bay u dheer tahay
I just know she did	Kaliya waan ogahay inay samaysay
Early and often.	Hore iyo inta badan.
You said so.	Adiga ayaa sidaas sheegtay.
I saw what happened.	Waxaan arkay waxa ku dhacay.
All over the place.	Meesha oo dhan.
I'm really sorry about that	Runtii aad ayaan uga xumahay arrintan
I have not seen many people	Qof badan maan arag
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
I know why you did it	Waan ogahay sababta aad u samaysay
I have heard a lot	In badan ayaan maqlay
I need everything for you	Wax walba waan kuu baahanahay
That is great.	Taasi aad bay u weyn tahay.
It has not been true to say.	Ma noqon wax run ah in la sheego.
I should have had another one	Waxay ahayd inaan mid kale haysto
I know her well.	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
He seemed happy with that.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan taas.
It was someone else.	Waxay ahayd qof kale.
I didn't even get to see him again.	Xitaa mar dambe maan helin inaan arko.
I have never seen that	Weligay taas lama arag
Each of us may have done something similar.	Qof kasta oo naga mid ah ayaa laga yaabaa inuu sameeyay wax la mid ah.
How to do that.	Sidee u sameeyaan taas.
I will not make you stay with me	Ka yeeli maayo inaad ila joogto
That will not happen.	Taasi ma dhici doonto.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
I heard and I wanted to be a part of it	Waan maqlay oo waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo
Luckily not much there.	Nasiib ma badan halkaas.
He is one of us.	Waa mid naga mid ah.
I wonder how it is now	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay hadda tahay
I never thought they were closest to home	Weligay uma malaynayn inay guriga ugu dhow yihiin
I wanted to do something	Waxaan rabay inaan wax sameeyo
I think that's amazing.	Waxay ila tahay taasi waa yaab.
Over time.	Waqti ka dib.
I think that is true	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run tahay
He will do whatever you want.	Wuu samayn doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
It is work.	Waa shaqada.
It really was something that still exists.	Runtii waxay ahayd wax ilaa hadda jira.
She told him what had happened.	Waxay u sheegtay wixii dhacay.
I wish you the same luck	Waxaan kuu rajeynayaa nasiib isku mid ah
Tell people, tell them.	Dadka u sheeg, u sheeg.
I love being there	Waxaan jeclahay inaan joogo
I did not find anything similar	Wax la mid ah ma helin
Not tonight, but soon.	Caawa maaha, laakiin dhawaan.
I want to be the person you want me to be	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qofka aad rabto inaan noqdo
This is not that.	Tani ma aha taas.
I could not believe it so much	Aad ayaan u rumaysan waayay
It did not exist before.	Ma aysan jirin markii hore.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
I found little here	Wax yar ayaan halkan ka helay
I just need some time.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa waqti ah.
I think they will not do it	Waxaan filayaa inaysan yeeli doonin
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
I wish it weren’t so	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aanay sidaas noqon
There was none available	Ma jirin mid la heli karo
It will not be beautiful.	Ma noqon doonto mid qurux badan.
You can not stay.	Ma ka joogi kartid.
I hope we will get better	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan fiicnaan doono
I really don't think so.	Runtii uma maleynayo isaga oo kale.
I am very happy to be here with you	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan kula joogo
More work space.	Meel badan oo lagu shaqeeyo.
I really wanted him	Aad ayaan u rabay isaga
I really don't want this.	Runtii ma rabin tan.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha mid adag.
Just nothing there.	Kaliya waxba halkaas.
It will not be again	Mar dambe ma noqon doono
I need something to do	Waxaan u baahanahay wax aan sameeyo
I had no idea you were there	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaad halkaas joogto
It won't go away much	In badan ma bixi doono
Definitely enough for you.	Waa hubaal in kugu filan.
I want one	Waxaan rabaa mid
Obviously, he was not there to see me.	Sida iska cad, ma uu joogin inuu i arko.
Really a lot.	Runtii aad u badan.
I did not know otherwise	Si kale maan garanayn
But this is not what you want.	Laakiin tani ma aha waxa aad rabto.
All of him.	Isaga oo dhan.
We were not.	Waxaan ahayn.
I really can't say.	Runtii ma sheegi karo.
I don't want to be like that.	Ma doonayo inaan sidaas oo kale noqdo.
He did not exist and now he does not exist.	Ma uusan jirin oo hadda ma uusan jirin.
I'll tell you what he's good at.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa uu ku fiican yahay.
I want to be a lover	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof jecel
I will be here for you	halkaan ayaan kuu joogi doonaa
There was something familiar.	Wax la yaqaan ayaa ka jiray.
I look bigger and more beautiful	Waxaan u muuqdaa mid ka weyn oo ka qurux badan
This is a great opportunity.	Tani waa fursad weyn.
I told him we could go out together	Waxaan u sheegay inaan isla bixi karno
I think he is a very bad person	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu yahay qof aad u xun
I heard that yesterday	Waxaan maqlay sidaas shalay
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
Everything is just as it is.	Wax walba waa sida ay yihiin oo kaliya.
I think it was the only time this would happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd markii kaliya ee ay tani dhici lahayd.
It was not the same thing.	Ma ahayn isku wax.
I had to work fast	Waxay ahayd inaan si degdeg ah u shaqeeyo
I wanted to have it.	Waxaan rabay inaan haysto.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
It’s big and big.	Waa mid weyn oo weyn.
I know what is best for you	Waan ogahay waxa kuu fiican
This may not be what you want.	Tani ma noqon karto waxa aad rabto.
But they will.	Laakiin way yeeli doonaan.
I should have known there was more to this.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inay jiraan wax ka badan tan.
I hope to see you soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan ku arko
It wasn't, but it was.	Ma aysan ahayn, laakiin wuu ahaa.
Everyone looked at me.	Qof kastaa wuu i eegay.
I put the rest	Inta kale ayaan dhigay
I know whatever it is, it is not right	Waan ogahay wax kasta oo ay tahay, sax maaha
He has to go	Waa inuu aado
I need the job.	Waxaan u baahanahay shaqada.
Before leaving.	Inta aanu ka bixin.
I know he knows me	Waan ogahay inuu i garanayo
Stop.	Jooji.
I know what to expect	Waan ogahay waxaan filan karo
It's too much.	Way aad u badan tahay.
I decided to do one of them	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan mid ka mid ah sameeyo
But she would probably see it after school.	Laakiin waxay u badan tahay inay arki lahayd dugsiga ka dib.
It looks like an interesting place.	Waxay u egtahay meel xiiso leh.
I, too, was surprised.	Aniga, sidoo kale, waa yaabay.
I hope to see you again soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko dhawaan
It's a little bit.	Waa wax yar.
I know you can do better.	Waan ogahay inaad wax ka fiican samayn karto.
I found one here	Waxaan helay mid halkan
I want to pick it up	Waxaan rabaa inaan soo qaado
I think that is not helpful	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aysan ahayn caawin
I could not do anything	waxba maan qaban karin
I will not be able to help you	Ma awoodi doono inaan ku caawiyo
Someone like me.	Qof aniga ila mid ah.
I had to do more	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan sameeyo
No one wanted a job	Shaqo qofna ma rabin
He was a lonely man.	Waxa uu ahaa nin keligiis ah.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
She didn't like it.	Ma ay jeclayn.
I really didn't want to talk to him	Runtii ma rabin inaan la hadlo
But that was it.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd.
He wants to help.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu caawiyo.
I would expect someone to be here somewhere	Waxaan filan lahaa in qof halkan joogo meel
He wants to leave, he said.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu baxo, wuxuu yiri.
This will be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
That could not be a good thing.	Taasi ma noqon karto wax wanaagsan.
I really thought he was one true friend	Runtii waxaan u maleeyay inuu yahay hal saaxiib oo run ah
I was just so excited	Kaliya waxaan ahaa mid xiiso leh
you are new here	halkan ayaad ku cusub tahay
I could not do this	Maan yeeli karin tan
He knew he had to talk to someone about that.	Wuu ogaa inuu qof kala hadlo taas.
I was there in trouble one day	Waxaan halkaas joogay dhib maalin
But there is.	Laakiin waxaa jira.
Where is that, he wondered.	Aaway taas, wuu yaabay.
But you can not see it now.	Laakiin hadda ma arki kartid.
I wanted to know what she thought	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxay la tahay
I did not want to leave home	Ma rabin in aan guriga ka tago
But no one wants to do anything hard.	Laakiin qofna ma doonayo inuu sameeyo wax adag.
I had to have something	Waxay ahayd inaan wax haysto
So far I have enjoyed it.	Ilaa hadda waan ka helay.
I will not do this.	Anigu ma samayn doono tan.
I love everything he does.	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo uu sameeyo.
I wanted to do the same	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyo
I can't find it	ma heli karo
I promised it would never happen again	Waxaan u ballan qaaday inaysan mar dambe dhici doonin
In many.	In badan.
Great place to stay	Meel aad u fiican oo la joogo
I would be fine	Waan fiicnaan lahaa
I never thought so	Weligay uma malaynayn sidaas
I can't believe he would do that	Ma rumaysan karo inuu taas samayn lahaa
I’ve got that to work with so far.	Waxaan taas ku helay inaan shaqeeyo ilaa hadda.
As it may not be anymore.	Sida laga yaabaa in aanay mar dambe.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
I did not want to be there.	Maan rabin inaan halkaas joogo.
But she did not want to.	Laakiin ma ay rabin.
I think we will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inaan fiicnaan doono.
I tried to leave him	Waxaan isku dayay inaan isaga tago
I never have it.	Waligiis ma haysto.
I hope they are not real.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan dhab ahayn.
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
He is fine.	Wuu fiican yahay.
Take something with you.	Wax ku qaado.
This is not.	Tani ma aha.
You said you love me.	Waxaad tidhi waad i jeceshahay.
I need to go there and talk	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas tago oo aan la hadlo
Everything is in place.	Wax walba waa meesha.
I know someone like that	Waan garanayaa qof sidaas oo kale ah
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
I was surprised by what she said	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa ay ku tidhi
This is smart.	Tani waa mid caqli badan.
We will see the rest.	Inta kale waan arki doonaa.
how did you do it ?.	sidee u samaysay?.
He could not be.	Ma uu noqon karin.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
I did not know she was with you	Maan ogeyn inay kula joogto
It takes time.	Waxay u baahan tahay waqti.
This will be the same.	Tani waxay ahaan doontaa sidoo kale.
I did not like what it would be	Maan jeclayn waxa uu noqon doono
This is not a big deal.	Tani wax weyn maaha.
You are good and you will be good.	Waad fiican tahay oo waad fiicnaan doontaa.
I know what we do	Waan ogahay waxaan samayno
Please, do not do this.	Fadlan, tan ha samayn.
I have to go for something.	Waa inaan aado wax.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe ma aha.
I can't see him.	Ma arki karo isaga.
I hope everyone is fine	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu wanaagsan yahay
I want to talk to you now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo hadda.
I'm sure of that	Waan hubaa taas
I have not seen another	Mid kale ma arag
This is a very bad idea.	Tani waa fikrad aad u xun.
But really, this is not the case.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, tani sidaas maaha.
It was, really, a bad time.	Waxay ahayd, runtii, waqti xun.
A few others did.	Wax yar oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
Mostly bad.	Inta badan si xun.
I am sure they will be ready for us.	Waxaan hubaa inay diyaar noo ahaan doonaan.
That is another lie.	Taasi waa been kale.
That is very bad.	Taasi aad bay u xun tahay.
Everything is an opportunity.	Wax walba waa fursad.
He was everything to me.	Wax walba ayuu ii ahaa.
In fact, they do not.	Run ahaantii, ma sameeyaan.
I have nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo aan sameeyo ma hayo.
Still, he said nothing.	Weli, waxba ma uu odhan.
But I did nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale ma samayn.
He seemed as happy as he could be.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan sida uu noqon karo.
This is good.	Tani waa mid wanaagsan.
I'm sure there is nothing wrong with that.	Waxaan hubaa inaysan waxba ka jirin.
I am very happy about this	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan
Here it is also rejected.	Halkan sidoo kale waa laga diiday.
Everyone left me.	Qof walba wuu iga tagay.
Everyone is enough.	Qof walba waa ku filan yahay.
I fell for it.	Waan ku dhacay.
This is a little complicated.	Tani waa wax yar oo adag.
One person will take a chance.	Hal qof oo fursad qaadan doona.
It could not be true.	Ma ay noqon karin run.
I told him you could see him tomorrow	Waxaan u sheegay inaad arki karto berrito
We can't be.	Ma noqon karno.
I need to see.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko.
It certainly was.	Waa hubaal inuu ahaa.
I did not say so	Ma odhan sidaas
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
I’ve never seen anything done so quickly.	Weligay ma arag wax si degdeg ah loo sameeyay.
I saw you coming out of school yesterday	Waxaan ku arkay adiga oo dugsiga ka soo baxay shalay
I want to know what happened to me	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa igu dhacay
One of us, always.	Mid naga mid ah, had iyo jeer.
This is not true.	Runtii tani run maaha.
This can be difficult by accident.	Tani waxay dhib ku noqon kartaa wax iska yimid.
Not true.	Run maaha.
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
He was seen every day.	Waa la arki jiray isaga maalin kasta.
In fact, this is a bad thing.	Dhab ahaantii, tani waa wax xun.
Even if they are not.	Xitaa haddii aysan ahayn.
And, if he does, it will be very difficult.	Oo, haddii uu sameeyo, waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
I'll talk to you later.	Waan kula hadli doonaa, ka dib.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd wax weyn.
Otherwise, it probably will not be.	Haddii kale, waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahaan doonin.
I thought you were good at this	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ku fiican tahay tan
It is no longer there.	Mar dambe ma joogto.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
You can	Waad dhici kartaa
I know you are a busy man	Waan ogahay inaad tahay nin mashquul ah
It will be over now.	Hadda way dhammaan doontaa.
I knew what was coming.	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda.
He came back.	Dib buu u soo noqday.
Maybe he is.	Malaha wuu yahay.
It can be a job.	Waxay noqon kartaa shaqo.
I need to talk to him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga
He was an old friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib hore.
I don't know if he did.	Ma garanayo inuu sameeyay iyo in kale.
I really knew what happened	Runtii waan ogaa waxa dhacay
I thought that was really good.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi runtii fiican tahay.
I don’t know why, really.	Ma garanayo sababta, runtii.
And so far it has been true.	Oo ilaa hadda run bay ahayd.
I felt ready for it	Waxaan dareemay inay diyaar ii tahay
It should not be a problem.	Waa inaysan dhibaato noqon.
It can pay off.	Way iska bixin kartaa.
Very little.	Runtii aad u yar.
Maybe I know what it is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan garanayo waxa uu yahay.
I did not want him to find me	Maan rabin inuu i helo
I do not have time for that.	Waqti uma hayo taas.
I had a bad time there	Waqti xun ayaan halkaas ku qaatay
You can do this.	Waad sameyn kartaa tan.
No one else does.	Qof kale ma sameeyo.
I just want it done to me	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in la igu sameeyo
I wonder how much it costs	Waxa aan la yaabanahay inta uu ku baxo
I have no idea what was said	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa la yidhi
I am very happy to help you here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan kugu caawiyo.
This was new to me.	Tani waxay igu ahayd mid igu cusub.
I can be better, I can be better.	Waan ka fiicnaan karaa, ka sii fiicnaan karaa.
I am not interesting	Ma ihi mid xiiso leh
I knew it was him	Waxaan ogaa inuu isaga yahay
It is likely that we will also see friends there	Waxa ay u badan tahay in aan sidoo kale halkaas ku arki doono saaxiibo
This is nothing new.	Tani maaha wax cusub.
I could not say how much	Ma sheegi karin ilaa inta
I found you	waan ku helay
It was so much more amazing and so much more amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax aad uga yaab badan oo aad uga yaab badan.
I just don’t want any problems.	Kaliya ma rabo wax dhibaato ah.
But it is more complicated than that.	Laakiin way ka sii dhib badan tahay taas.
It is better than that.	Way ka fiican tahay taas.
It will happen to us.	Way nagu dhici doontaa.
This was probably right.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inay sax ahayd.
I had no idea it was too small.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin inay aad u yar tahay.
No one can be like him.	Qofna ma noqon karo isaga oo kale.
I had no intention of him really	Wax niyad ah uma lahayn isaga oo dhab ah
Maybe I can stay there for a while	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan halkaas joogi karo in muddo ah
There was nowhere to go.	Meel la aado ma jirin.
I want what is best for him.	Waxaan rabaa waxa isaga u wanaagsan.
Too much for me.	Aad ii badan.
Not much.	Wax badan ma jiraan.
I will stop	waan joojin doonaa
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
I do not feel that way now.	Hadda ma dareemayo sidaas.
That you now know is the case.	Taasi hadda waad ogtahay inay taasi tahay.
I think he is better.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ka fiican yahay.
I went out just because he needed to talk	Waxaan u baxay oo kaliya inuu u baahan yahay inuu hadlo
I can't be.	Ma noqon karo.
he can do it.	wuu samayn karaa.
You would like to say that.	Waxaad jeclaan lahayd inaad taas u sheegto.
He can see it again.	Mar kale wuu arki karaa.
It was just.	Waxay ahayd kaliya.
But there were several.	Laakiin waxaa jiray dhowr.
He came in and did something.	Meesha ayuu soo galay oo wax ku sameeyay.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
Give me time.	Waqti i sii.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha mid adag.
I would like to do it myself	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo aniga
Too much.	Aad iyo aad u badan.
Nothing can be found at the door.	Ma jiro wax laga heli karo albaabka.
Lots of bad stuff.	Waxyaabo badan oo xun.
I want to do better things	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo ka wanaagsan
We may not need it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u baahnayn.
Many such things have happened	Waxyaabo badan oo sidaas oo kale ah ayaa dhacay
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax iska cad.
I think you can take a few more	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad qaadan karto dhowr kale
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
I would like to know what you would do	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado waxaad samayn lahayd
I felt you wanted me	Waxaan dareemay inaad i rabto
I should not have done this	Ma ahayn inaan tan sameeyo
As you wish.	Sida aad rabto.
He really does.	Runtii wuu sameeyaa.
I know this for sure	Waan ogahay tan si hubaal ah
We are ready for that.	Diyaar ayaan u nahay taas.
This is awful and weird.	Tani waa wax aad u xun oo la yaab leh.
I love him so much	Aad ayaan uga jeclahay isaga
It's really great.	Runtii waa wax weyn.
I did not have to come back	Ma ahayn inaan soo noqdo
I still need to be held	Weli waxaan u baahanahay in la i hayo
It would be nice if someone could help.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii qof uu caawin karo.
I want to get to know you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku barto
Good day everyone.	Maalin wanaagsan qof walba.
He got it right	Si sax ah ayuu u helay
Now a lot is felt.	Hadda wax badan baa la dareemay.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
There is nothing complicated.	Ma jiraan wax dhib badan.
I really can't believe it	Runtii ma rumaysan karo
I would be.	waan ahaan lahaa.
I wish everyone knew that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in qof walba ogaado taas
I need to be here with you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaan kula joogo
I am ready for something new	Waxaan diyaar u ahay wax cusub
I hope it is good	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiican tahay
I am ready for this.	diyaar ayaan u ahay kan .
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto
I hope to see you again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko
There were things that had to be done.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo ay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I've seen it for a while now	Waxaan arkay in muddo ah hadda
I knew she was a good person	Waan ogaa inay ahayd qof wanaagsan
I really have nothing	Runtii waxba ma hayo
The great unknown is still great and unknown.	Wax weyn oo aan la garanayn ayaa weli ah mid weyn oo aan la garanayn.
That cannot happen	Taasi ma dhici karto
But, well, we can't get that.	Laakiin, si fiican, taas ma heli karno.
I still want to be kept	Wali waxaan rabaa in la ii hayo
He was not smart.	Ma ahayn mid caqli badan.
I really didn’t want to know.	Runtii ma rabin inaan ogaado.
He should not have done that.	Ma ahayn inuu taas sameeyo.
I just know you will like it	Kaliya waan ogahay inaad jeclaan doonto
I am a smart person	Waxaan ahay qof caqli badan
At home, too.	Guriga, sidoo kale.
I am the only one who says where it is	Anigu waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee ay sheegto meesha ay tahay
I do not have and I will not tell anyone until you do	Ma hayo cidna u sheegi maayo ilaa aad samayso
It never was.	Waligiis sidaas ma ahayn.
It was all so bad.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I think that's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run tahay.
It has always been a problem.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd dhibaato.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
There is no truth.	Run ma jirto.
I love you you know that	waan ku jeclahay taas waad ogtahay
You can come back to us.	Waad nagu soo noqon kartaa.
I should have known he had more than one car	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inuu haysto wax ka badan hal baabuur
I am happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
You may want to do the same.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso.
I have no idea how to do it.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida uu u sameeyo.
It's hard to say.	Way adag tahay in la sheego.
I have always wanted one	Weligay mid baan rabay
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
But that is another time.	Laakiin taasi waa wakhti kale.
I want to tell her how it is	Waxaan rabaa inaan u sheego sida ay tahay
You can't stay here much longer.	Halkan wax badan kuma sii joogi kartid.
I always found it there	Had iyo jeer waan ka helay halkaas
But most love money.	Laakiin inta badan waxay jecel yihiin lacag.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jirto.
I think that's the hardest part.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ugu adag tahay.
I'm really sorry	Runtii aad baan ugu xumahay
I have never been here	Weligay halkan ma iman
I wondered why he wanted to see me	Waxaan la yaabay sababta uu u rabo inuu i arko
They are too much for him.	Aad bay u badan yihiin isaga.
I want him to be here with me	Waxaan rabaa inuu halkaan ila joogo
But then, one day, someone picked up one.	Laakiin ka dib, maalin, qof ayaa soo qaaday mid ka mid ah.
Even a lot less than anything.	Xitaa wax badan oo ka yar waxba.
It's bad now.	Way xun tahay hadda.
I had no idea what was going on	Maan lahayn fikrad yar waxa socda
I have seen a lot of time.	Waxaan arkay waqti badan.
I thought you wanted to know	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto inaad ogaato
She was a friend, he decided.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib, ayuu go'aansaday.
Everyone was there.	Qof kastaa wuu joogay.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
I often wonder how it is done	Waxaan inta badan la yaabanahay sida loo sameeyo
found.	helay.
But now there is nothing we can do about it.	Laakiin hadda ma jiraan wax aan ka qaban karno.
I got a better one	Mid ka wanaagsan ayaan helay
It would be nice to be there too.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaad sidoo kale halkaas joogto.
I love amazing things	Waxaan jeclahay waxyaabo yaab leh
Everything is correct.	Wax walba waa sax.
He is obviously gone.	Waxa iska cad inuu baxay.
Mar.	Mar.
I knew it didn't exist	Waan ogaa in aanay jirin
I will not have enough time	Waqti igu filan ma heli doono
I think it is beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan tahay.
I thought he had already left	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu mar hore tagay
I was lucky.	Nasiib baan lahaa.
I will do everything else.	Wax walba oo kale ayaan sameyn doonaa.
Anything can be done.	Wax walba waa la samayn karaa.
Enough, now.	Ku filan, hadda.
Less than possible.	In ka yar inta laga yaabo.
That you can do the same.	In aad samayn karto wax la mid ah.
He did not understand.	Ma uu fahmin.
You know this can be good for me.	Waad ogtahay in tani ay ii fiicnaan karto.
I just didn’t know what else to do	Kaliya ma aan garanayn wax kale oo aan sameeyo
I can not say what it was	Ma sheegi karo waxay ahayd
I had to do something now	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sameeyo hadda
Only that, nothing else.	Kaliya taas, wax kale ma jiraan.
I knew he would not take this well	Waan ogaa inuusan si fiican tan u qaadan doonin
Really, that would be a good thing.	Run ahaantii, taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax wanaagsan.
I like to see it that way.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan sidaas u arko.
He knew she wanted more.	Wuu ogaa in ay wax badan rabto.
She can do anything.	Wax walba way samayn kartaa.
Now I can do no more than that	Hadda wax ka badan ma samayn karo isaga
Constant work.	Shaqo joogto ah.
I didn't even want to	Xitaa ma rabin
I know him very well	Si dhib ah ayaan isaga garanayaa
Very good.	Mid aad u fiican.
I am very sorry about this.	Aad baan uga xumahay arrintan.
They made no time.	Wax wakhti ah ma ay samayn.
He was clear.	Mid cad ayuu ahaa.
I have never told anyone about this before	Weligay qofna uma sheegin arrintan hadda ka hor
I wanted a good person	Waxaan rabay qof wanaagsan
I was nobody.	Qofna maan ahayn.
I'm glad you did.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad samaysay.
I think you can come home now	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad hadda guriga ku soo noqon karto
It 's time after that.	Waqti ayaa taas ka dib.
I know they will.	Waan ogahay inay yeeli doonaan.
But it no longer exists.	Laakiin hadda ma sii jiro.
Not too many cars.	Ma aha baabuur aad u badan.
Always, everywhere.	Had iyo jeer, meel kasta.
It is something that everyone can do.	Waa wax qof walba samayn karo.
I will never go anywhere other than here	Weligay meel kale ma aadi doono oo aan halkan ahayn
I'm not sure anyone does.	Ma hubo in qofna sameeyo.
I left him very much.	Aad baan uga tagay.
It was not so.	Ma ahayn sidaas.
I think it is correct	Waxaan filayaa inay sax tahay
For the same reason.	Sababta isku mid ah.
I was amazed like everyone else.	Waxaan la yaabay sida qof kasta.
I really don't care	Runtii waxba igama qabo
You have done everything well, so far.	Wax walba si wanaagsan ayaad u samaysay, ilaa hadda.
I really wish you hadn't told me	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaadan ii sheegin
I did not know you know	Maan garanayn inaad ogtahay
I can only wish it was true.	Waxaan jeclaan karaa oo kaliya inay run tahay.
In fact, there was something in it.	Runtii, wax baa ku jiray.
I can't see him.	Ma arki karo isaga.
I have not been here before	Hadda ka hor halkan ma aan joogin
Very good too	Mid aad u fiican sidoo kale
It should be more than enough.	Waa in ka badan ku filan.
It was enough.	Waxay ahayd ku filan.
We will get to you later.	Mid ka dib ayaan ku heli doonaa.
You will find me still as before.	Waxaad ii heli doontaa weli sidii hore.
I wish I hadn't talked about it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaanan ka hadlin
It was really fun.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Seen everything.	Arkay wax walba.
I think, but everything	Waxaan qabaa, laakiin wax kasta
He would need time for this.	Wuxuu u baahan lahaa waqti tan.
It is placed here.	Halkan ayaa la dhigay.
I decided on the former	Waxaan go'aansaday kii hore
I knew it was good.	Waan ogaa inay wanaagsan tahay.
They will believe in him.	Way rumaysan doonaan isaga.
I need this.	Waxaan u baahanahay tan.
I'll see you tonight	waan arki doonaa caawa
There is so much.	Wax badan ayaa jira.
That has to be done.	Taasi waa in la sameeyaa.
I had to be there	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas joogo
I would always be	Mar walba waan ahaan lahaa
Here it is.	Waa kan.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
I have to	waa inaan haysto
This is a beautiful place	Tani waa meel qurux badan
Maybe I am more of a person.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ahay qof ka badan.
I always knew they were alive	Mar walba waan ogaa inay nool yihiin
He is now one of us.	Hadda waa mid naga mid ah.
Do nothing else.	Wax kale ha samayn.
I reported that.	taas ayaan soo sheegay.
Nothing more.	Wax ka badan ma jiro.
I have never been to one before.	Weligay mid hore uma joogin.
I have to say that and more	Taas iyo wax ka badan ayaan ku leeyahay
Unlucky again.	Nasiib ma leh mar kale.
I left it as it was	Sidii ay ahayd ayaan uga tagay
She said.	Way tidhi.
I thought it was the best.	Waxaan u maleeyay sida ugu fiican.
I really need to talk to you.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo.
Just about everyone has a car.	Kaliya qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay baabuur.
But there was nothing else.	Laakiin ma jirin wax kale.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
I did not succeed a bit	Ma aan guulaysan xoogaa
Maybe he already had.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hore u lahaa.
you can not give.	ma aadan siin karin.
But he loves it.	Laakiin wuu jecel yahay.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
It's a problem, a big one.	Waa dhibaato, mid aad u weyn.
Everything right had to be done.	Wax kasta oo sax ah waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
No one came out.	Qofna uma soo bixin.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
I am so excited to be here !.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan ku joogo!.
I want to know about you	Waxaan rabaa inaan adiga kaa ogaado
And this was it.	Oo tan bay ahayd.
It didn't matter to me.	Waxba igama lahayn.
It didn't take long to find it.	Waqti badan kuma qaadan in la helo.
Someone else, it can't happen.	Qof kale, ma dhici karto.
You did not have to be there.	Ma ahayn inaad halkaas joogto.
You said more.	Wax ka badan ayaad sheegtay.
But a lot has happened before and after.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa dhacay ka hor iyo ka dib.
Don't talk anymore.	Mar dambe ha hadlin.
And that he does not want.	Iyo in uusan rabin.
I want to know what is going on here	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa halkan ka socda
I really enjoyed that, too	Aad ayaan uga helay taas, sidoo kale
I did not want food.	Maan rabin cunto.
I told him.	Waxaan u sheegay.
I love work	Waan jeclahay shaqada
I couldn’t do much cooking	Wax badan ma aan samayn karin cunto karin
I wanted to go back	Waxaan rabay inaan dib u noqdo
I could not do anything wrong	Wax xun ma sameyn karin
I have a lot of money	Lacag badan baan hayaa
I used to be the best at that	Waxaan ahaan jiray kan ugu fiican taas
I have nothing, as you can see	Waxba ma hayo, sida aad arki karto
She loves what she does.	Waxay jeceshahay waxay samayso.
I can no longer do it	Mar dambe ma samayn karo
Why.	Waa maxay sababta ay.
Probably too much.	Malaha aad u badan.
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
I do not want to stay	Ma rabo inaan sii joogo
I will not do that.	Taas ma samaynayo.
Let them do that.	Ha sameeyaan taas.
He looked very happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u faraxsan.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
would we lie to you ?.	been ma kuu sheegi lahayn?.
I am very happy to do it	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay samaynta
Please help me !!!.	Fadlan ii caawin!!!.
I will talk about something real	Waxaan ka hadli doonaa wax dhab ah
"It's good," he said.	Way fiican tahay ayuu yidhi.
I can help you	waan ku caawin karaa
I can't like him.	Ma jeclaan karo isaga.
He really didn't want to.	Runtii ma uu rabin.
I'm sure she must be very beautiful	Waan hubaa inay tahay inay aad u qurux badan tahay
He came back big.	Si weyn ayuu u soo noqday.
No one said so	Qofna ma odhan waa sidaas
I think he got lucky	Waxaan filayaa inuu nasiib helay
I will leave this one.	Waan ka bixi doonaa kan.
I once told you that everyone knows	Mar baan kuu sheegay in qof kastaa garanayo
I have to want something	Waa inaan wax rabaa
It is all now.	Dhammaan waa hadda.
He can only get out.	Kaliya wuu ka bixi karaa.
Maybe he wanted to.	Malaha wuu rabay.
I can do that if you want	Taas waan samayn karaa haddii aad rabto
I looked at it a long time ago	Waxaan eegay wakhti dheer ka hor
I really enjoyed this	Runtii waan ka helay tan
I couldn't believe how he felt	Ma rumaysan karin sida uu dareemayo
Now I am starting to do what is good.	Hadda waxaan bilaabay inaan sameeyo waxa wanaagsan.
That will do now.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa hadda.
I did not want to, really	Maan rabin, runtii
I love it so much here.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay halkan.
You do not need this.	Uma baahnid tan.
I can really help you with that	Dhab ahaantii waan kaa caawin karaa taas
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
What happened to you.	Maxaa kugu dhacay.
But otherwise, it is clearly not true.	Laakiin si kale, waxa iska cad in aanay run ahayn.
I think he was right	Waxaan filayaa in uu sax ahaa
In fact, he must have done it.	Dhab ahaantii, waa inuu sameeyay.
I know what he needs me to do	Waan ogahay waxa uu u baahan yahay inaan sameeyo
It would help him get it.	Way ka caawin lahayd inuu helo.
I really did not know who he was	Runtii maan garanayn cidda uu yahay
I have to talk to someone about this.	Waa inaan qof kala hadlo arrintan.
As really live.	Sida runtii nool.
That has something to do with it	Taasi wax bay leedahay
We love each other.	Waanu is jeclayn.
I just have no idea.	Kaliya fikrad ma leh.
A little longer	In yar oo ka dheer
I don't like that very much	Aad uma jecli taas
I came back from a very good place	Waxaan ka soo noqday meel aad u wanaagsan
I have no problem now	Wax dhib ah igama qabo hadda
You can't say anything to me.	Waxba ima odhan kartid.
I did not really take it	Si dhab ah uma aan qaadan
He made it interesting.	Waxa uu ka dhigay mid xiiso leh.
She loves it.	Way jeceshahay.
I would like to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo
I looked closely	Waxaan si dhow u eegay
I have not believed in that for a long time.	Taas maan rumaysan muddo dheer.
I wanted to be with him	Waxaan rabay inaan la joogo
He was there, he was there.	Wuu joogay, wuu joogay.
.	.
He really isn’t someone like him.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha qof isaga oo kale ah.
I need to know something else	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado wax kale
I know how he feels	Waan ogahay sida uu dareemayo
But he was not there.	Laakiin ma uu joogin.
I am very scared	Aad ayaan uga baqayaa
He seemed happy to see me.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan inuu i arko.
Not after that.	Taas ka dib ma aha.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
I really didn't get much more to talk to	Runtii wax ka badan ma helin inaan la hadlo
I need you to do what you promised me.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad sameyso wixii aad ii ballan qaaday.
Interestingly, I have never seen it before.	Xiiso leh, hore uma arag.
He thought that was true.	Taasi run buu mooday.
Here is what you can do about it.	Waa kan waxa aad ka qaban karto.
It's like new.	Waa sida cusub.
I did not know why that could be	Maan garanayn sababta ay taasi noqon karto
Until he.	Ilaa uu.
She can do it.	Way samayn kartaa.
But you are much more than that.	Laakiin aad ayaad uga badan tahay taas.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inay ogaato.
One known.	Mid la yaqaan.
That does not exist now.	Taasi hadda ma jirto.
Best place for all.	Hal meel oo dhan ugu fiican.
I want him to learn that	Waxaan rabaa inuu taas barto
Every day is a new day.	Maalin kasta waa maalin cusub.
I have to stay home soon.	Waa inaan guriga joogo wax yar ka dib.
He was small.	Wuxuu ahaa mid yar.
She would leave me.	Way iga tagi lahayd.
Please let me know when you do.	Fadlan ii soo sheeg marka aad sidaas sameyso.
I picked it up somewhere else	Meel kale ayaan ka soo qaatay
But maybe so too.	Laakiin malaha sidoo kale waa taas.
I can't believe how much they are	Ma rumaysan karo inta ay yihiin
I just didn’t have it.	Kaliya maan haysan.
I wonder what they are	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxay yihiin
I wish you very good luck.	Waxaan kuu rajeynayaa nasiib aad u wanaagsan.
He may also do his best.	Sidoo kale waxa laga yaabaa in uu sameeyo sida ugu fiican.
Something to do.	Wax la sameeyo.
I can hardly do the making	Waxaan si dhib leh u samayn karaa samaynta
But, how much.	Laakiin, inta ay tahay.
Let me see him.	Aan arko isaga.
He felt she was doing it now.	Waxa uu dareemay in ay sidaas samaynayso hadda.
he is good.	wuu fiican yahay.
There was no such thing here.	Wax la mid ah ma jirin halkan.
I thought he knew it well	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu si fiican u yaqaan
I don't think so.	Anigu sidaas uma arko.
To know that no one really understands another.	Si aad u ogaato in qofna uusan si dhab ah u fahmin mid kale.
He looks good.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid wanaagsan.
Certainly not right.	Wax hubaal ah ma ahayn sax.
I will not tell you what you said	U sheegi maayo waxaad tidhi
But it looks beautiful.	Laakiin waxay u egtahay qurux.
I have never been here long.	Weligay halkan wakhti dheer ma joogo.
It was nothing, maybe, but I didn’t like it.	Waxba ma ahayn, malaha, laakiin ma jeclayn.
This was fun to do.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh in la sameeyo.
But not me.	Laakiin aniga maaha.
The more you do, the better you will get.	Inta badan oo aad sameyso, si fiican ayaad u heli doontaa.
Well done really.	Si fiican loo sameeyay runtii.
That is true for everyone.	Taasi waa sax qof walba.
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
I doubt if he told me what to do.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay haddii uu ii sheegay waxa aan sameeyo.
It looks like they need it.	Waxay u egtahay inay u baahan yihiin.
He never said much.	Waligiis wax badan ma odhan.
I thought you would be.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad noqon doonto.
I told him that	Taas ayaan u sheegay
It was a great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
I have a friend who lives there	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiib halkaas ku nool
Not now, not always.	Hadda maaha, wakhti kasta maaha.
You do not have to say anything.	Ma aha inaad wax sheegto.
I need to talk to you now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda kula hadlo
I wanted him to leave me	Waxa aan rabay in uu iga tago
No one is here.	Qofna halkan ma joogo.
I got enough for one day	Waxaan helay wax igu filan hal maalin
I think this is a good thing	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay wax wanaagsan
I was three.	Waxaan ahaa saddex.
I still have nothing to do	Weli maan helin wax aan sameeyo
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
They will say something.	Wax bay odhan doonaan.
I know what's going on	Waan ogahay waxa la isku hayo
I pretended to be	Taas ayaan iska dhigay
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
There may be something in it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax ku jiraan.
Both are great.	Labaduba waa weyn yihiin.
Take what you want.	Qaado waxaad rabto.
I will not return	Wali soo noqon maayo
I hope you will do well here	Waxaan filayaa inaad halkan ku fiicnaan doonto
I think we can still help him	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan wali caawin karno isaga
I could no longer do it.	Mar dambe maan qaban karin.
I would like him to eat more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu wax badan cuno
I have a lot to learn	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan barto
We are made.	Waa nala sameeyay.
I wanted to be part of it	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo
I really am	Runtii waan ahay
For a long time.	Muddo dheer.
Everyone probably does.	Qof kastaa malaha wuu sameeyaa.
It can be inclusive.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid loo dhan yahay.
I'm really happy about that	Runtii waan ku faraxsanahay taas
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
they did not succeed enough.	kuma ay guulaysan in ku filan.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I suspect they don't like me	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inaysan i jeclayn
I thought it was interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax aan ka qaban karno.
I have an idea to make	Waxaan qabaa fikrad aan samayno
You are a good man.	nin fiican baad tahay.
I really didn't get that	Runtii taas maan helin
I am nobody	Qofna ma ihi
you did not do that.	ma aadan samayn taas.
He does not leave the house.	Guriga kama baxo.
I did not think so	Ma malaynayn taas
Good thing too.	Wax fiican sidoo kale.
I wanted to tell you that	Waxaan rabay inaan taas kuu sheego
As he.	Sida uu.
I could not do anything	Waxba kama aan qaban karin
Great stuff.	Waxyaabo aad u weyn.
You are so beautiful this.	Aad baad ugu qurux badan tahay kan.
I do not think it is the same now.	U malayn maayo inay hadda la mid tahay.
I think I will go home soon	Waxaan filayaa inaan dhawaan guriga aadi doono
He would keep one.	Mid buu iska haysan lahaa.
I had no friends to talk to	Maan lahayn saaxiibo aan ka hadlo
Probably so.	Malaha waa sidaas.
I could not see why he could not stay so long	Ma arki karin sababta uu u sii joogi waayay muddo dheer
Very happy.	Aad u faraxsan.
We need to do this.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan samayno tan.
We are known.	Waa nala yaqaan.
I should not have been surprised	Ma ahayn inaan la yaabanahay
I want you to be here	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan joogto
That is very, very long.	Taasi waa mid aad iyo aad u dheer.
I know you love me more than anyone	Waan ogahay inaad i jeceshahay in ka badan qof kasta
This is a lot.	Tani waa wax badan.
But so far they will not.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma yeeli doonaan.
That was right.	Taasi sax bay ahayd.
They didn’t take it well.	Si fiican uma ay qaadan.
He is coming.	Waa iman.
neither you nor anyone else wants	adiga iyo qof kale ma rabo
Now they do not understand anything.	Hadda waxba ma ay fahmin.
I have to go now	Waa inaan hadda tago
There was only this.	Waxaa jiray tan kaliya.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
But he refused to leave.	Laakiin wuu diiday inuu baxo.
It does not return.	Uma noqdo.
I don't like it when she does this	Ma jecli marka ay tan sameyso
I liked him a little.	Waan ka helay isaga in yar.
I know.	waan ogahay.
I did not get it but everything	Maan helin laakiin wax kasta
No time	Wax aan waqti lahayn
I did not go back.	Dib uma noqon.
I was not able to stay there	Ma awoodin inaan halkaas joogo
Not sure now	Ma hubo hadda
I should have said it earlier.	Waxay ahayd inaan hore u sheego.
I know it's not what you like	Waan ogahay inaysan ahayn waxaad jeceshahay
Maybe they are even better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xitaa aad ugu fiican yihiin.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I still have little to say to you	Weli wax yar ayaan ku leeyahay
Here is one.	Waa kan mid.
I did not understand at first.	Maan fahmin markii hore.
I didn't have to	Ma ahayn inaan sameeyo
I saw it somewhere	Meel baan ku arkay
I saw what he wanted.	Waxaan arkay waxa uu rabo.
I think that is a good idea	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay fikrad wanaagsan
Tell me what is true, what is not.	Ii sheeg waxa run ah, waxa aan ahayn.
I can't believe it hasn't been done before	Ma rumaysan karo inaan hore loo samayn
You can help me.	Waad i caawin kartaa.
I can give you a good time	Waxaan ku siin karaa waqti fiican
I wish you could stay longer too	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad sidoo kale joogi karto waqti dheer
Maybe I saw him without getting it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan arkay isaga oo aan helin
I will never leave you again	Mar dambe kaa tagi maayo
I really don't want to talk about this	Runtii ma rabo inaan arrintan ka hadlo
And this was good.	Oo tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I wanted to go badly	Waxaan rabay inaan aado si xun
This was a lie.	Tani waxay ahayd been.
It was just done that way.	Kaliya sidaas ayaa loo sameeyay.
That will not happen.	Taasi ma dhici doonto.
This is enough for us.	Waxaa nagu filan tan.
I told him something	Wax baan u sheegay
You do, people.	Waxaad samayn, dadka.
No trouble came for him.	Wax dhib ah ayaa u yimid isaga.
I did not succeed	Anigu ma guulaysan
I hope you will help me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin doonto
I know what I do now.	Waan garanayaa waxa aan sameeyo hadda.
I can clearly see it now	Si cad ayaan hadda u arki karaa
Maybe there was someone there.	Malaha waxaa jiray qof halkaas joogay.
I did not know if it was real or not	Maan garanayn inay dhab tahay iyo in kale
I wondered how it would end	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay ku dhammaan doonto
I did and got this	Waan sameeyay oo tan helay
I did not see the next one	Maan arag soo socda
But now she has done it.	Laakiin hadda way samaysay.
You can see what is going on here.	Waxaad arki kartaa waxa halkan ka socda.
I did not want to come back	Ma rabin inaan soo noqdo
I just don't want to	Kaliya ma rabin
I was not there long enough.	Ma aanan joogin halkaas waqti igu filan.
That is what he wants.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabo.
I hope someone knows what to do	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof garanayo waxa la sameeyo
It is really nice to see you.	Runtii aad bay u wanaagsan tahay inaan ku arko.
But still nothing.	Laakiin weli waxba.
There are many things they do not understand.	Wax badan oo aysan fahmin ayaa jira.
You really weren’t there.	Runtii halkaas kuma aadan lahayn.
I had to say that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas sheego
I used to do it regularly	Si joogto ah ayaan u samayn jiray
Everything.	Wax kasta.
It didn't help anyone to do it.	Qofna kama caawin inuu sameeyo.
I wish she was here with me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay halkan ila joogto
I love him	Isaga waan jeclahay
It's all gone.	Dhammaan waa tagay.
Not an opportunity.	Fursad maaha.
I'm very happy!.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay!.
That is a problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato.
No one said much.	Qofna wax badan ma odhan.
I liked him.	Waan ka helay isaga.
The rest was like that.	Inta kale sidaas bay ahayd.
I would talk to him	Waan la hadli lahaa
I did not have to say much	Ma ahayn inaan wax badan sheego
You have the following.	Waxaad leedahay soo socda.
I know how it is	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay
That doesn't matter now.	Taas hadda waxba ma jiraan.
I just did not understand why	Kaliya ma fahmin sababta
This is how it is.	Tani waa sida ay tahay.
All true so far.	Dhammaan run ilaa hadda.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan.
Now that is a thing.	Hadda taasi waa wax.
I have had a lot of time studying	Waxaan helay wakhti badan oo aan wax ku barto
Three of them.	Saddex ka mid ah.
I will leave	waan bixi doonaa
Several people came in	Dhowr qof ayaa soo galay
I did not pay to buy it	Uma bixin si aan u iibsado
Maybe I told you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan kuu sheegay.
This is not an opportunity.	Tani maaha fursad.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma i caawin karaa.
I can't see him, yet	Ma arki karo isaga, weli
Everyone is really a friend.	Qof walba runtii waa saaxiib.
I have to see you in person	Waa inaan ku arko qof ahaan
I think that exists.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi jirto.
And out.	Oo ka baxay.
I still have to stay home	Wali waa inaan sii joogo guriga
I will get rid of that soon.	Taas waan ka bixi doonaa mar dhow.
I do not want to be anything.	Ma rabo inaan wax noqdo.
I love that you really want me	Waxaan jeclahay in aad aad ii rabto
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay.
I like.	Waan jeclahay.
Do a good job.	Qabo shaqo fiican.
I have a friend there	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiib halkaas
I think this would be.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ahaan lahayd.
I had no money	Lacag ma haysan
I know why you did it	Waan ogahay sababta aad u samaysay
I could not do it for him	Ma aan samayn karin isaga
I even love it, which is for me	Xitaa waan jeclahay, taas oo aniga ii ah
I had nothing to do with that	Wax shaqo ah kuma aan lahayn taas
It could not be found.	Waa la heli waayay.
I was also lucky	Waxaan sidoo kale ahaa nasiib
I have to help him.	Waa inaan caawiyo isaga.
Beautiful.	Qurux badan.
I will not even be here	Xitaa halkaan ma joogi doono
tell me you still love me.	ii sheeg in aad wali i jeceshahay.
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqada tago
And no wonder why.	Oo la yaab ma leh sababta.
But that's fine.	Laakiin taasi way fiican tahay.
He said he needed to eat.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu u baahan yahay inuu wax cuno.
I really did not know	Dhab ahaan maan ogeyn
It was once, isn't it?	Waxay ahayd hal mar, miyaanay ahayn.
he will receive.	wuu heli doonaa.
I will definitely tell you that	Runtii taas ayaan u sheegi doonaa
I think you are very sorry	Waxaan filayaa inaad aad uga xun tahay
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
Maybe that will help	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ku caawin doonto
I need to know how it will end	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida ay ku dhammaan doonto
To come.	In uu yimaado.
It's not pretty	Ma qurux badna
He must be close.	Waa inuu u dhow yahay.
I liked it, but not so much	Waan ka helay isaga, laakiin sidaas maaha
I looked at the rest of the room	Inta kale ee qolka ku jiray ayaan eegay
I do it again and again	Mar kale iyo mar kale ayaan sameeyaa
He knew it was true.	Wuu ogaa inay run tahay.
He said it is likely.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay u badan tahay.
I wondered what she was doing and where she was	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa ay samaynayso iyo halka ay joogto
I don't mind that.	Dhib igama qabo taas.
I wanted to know everything	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ka ogaado
I really wanted to see how it is	Waxaan runtii rabay inaan arko sida ay tahay
I was another man	Waxaan ahaa nin kale
Maybe she wants me to know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay rabto inaan ogaado.
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
I really need you to be here	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaan joogto
I want you to know.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato.
This was not the only reason.	Tani ma ahayn sababta kaliya.
I am with you now	hadda waan kuu joogaa
It's so bad.	Waa sidaas u xun.
I expect someone else to do the same	Waxaan filayaa in qof kale uu sidaas oo kale sameeyo
But it was only for a while.	Laakiin waxa ay ahayd kaliya muddo.
That can not be done.	Taasi ma samayn karto.
I will be ready	diyaar ayaan noqon doonaa
I did not like people	Anigu ma aan jeclayn dadka
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
I knew it looked familiar	Waan ogaa inay u egtahay mid la yaqaan
I still think this is true.	Wali waxaan filayaa in tani run tahay.
I will always be here	Had iyo jeer halkan ayaan joogi doonaa
I have to be there for that	Waa inaan halkaas u joogaa taas
I did not	maan samayn
I should never have come here	Ma ahayn inaan weligay halkan iman
I did.	Waan sameeyay.
Time to go.	Waqti aan tagi lahaa.
And as he used to do.	Iyo sidii uu hore u samayn jiray.
we will see you soon	dhawaan ayaan ku arki doonaa
I am happy to talk about it	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ka hadlo
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxa laga samaynayo.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo mar dambe.
I really wanted to	Aad iyo aad ayaan u rabay
I did not want to do this	Maan rabin inaan tan sameeyo
One more difficult	Mid ka dhib badan
It is a difficult time.	Waa waqti adag.
I had to have it there	Waa inaan ku lahaa halkaas
Very difficult.	Aad u adag.
He really seems to know everyone.	Runtii wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu qof walba garanayo.
I got paid.	Lacag baan helay.
But it is not the same.	Laakiin isku mid maaha.
He seemed familiar, too.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid la yaqaan, sidoo kale.
I do not want to have it any other way	Ma doonayo inaan si kale u haysto
What do you think?	Maxaad u malaynaysaa?.
I had to find out quickly.	Waxay ahayd inaan si degdeg ah wax u ogaado.
But that is not much.	Laakiin taasi wax badan maaha.
You are loved.	Waa lagu jecel yahay.
He does that every day.	Taas ayuu sameeyaa maalin kasta.
I don't even know him.	Xitaa ma garanayo isaga.
Maybe you don't get it	Malaha inaadan helin
I hope you will do the same	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto
I'm not sure if that is true.	Ma hubo in ay taasi sax tahay.
I will not see him again	Mar dambe ma arki doono
This is enough for me	Waxaa igu filan tan
I wanted to be with him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la joogo.
He left a little.	Wuu ka yara baxay.
I can't do anything	Waxba ma samayn karo
I want to stay here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan sii joogo
I hope everyone has a good day.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu leeyahay maalin wanaagsan.
In fact, it is one.	Dhab ahaantii, waa mid.
I knew what had happened	Waan ogaa waxa dhacay
How very.	Sidee aad u.
I could not take it for anything else	Waxa aan u qaadan waayay wax kasta oo kale
I can no longer speak	Mar dambe ma hadli karin
You can only see it.	Kaliya waad arki kartaa.
That’s a lot going on.	Taasi waa waxyaabo badan oo socda.
It sounds like a good idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad fiican.
I am ready to go now.	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan hadda tago.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
He wanted to come.	Wuxuu rabay inuu yimaado.
and, and, and.	iyo, iyo, iyo.
You are like him.	Waxaad tahay isaga oo kale.
I wanted to eat one.	Waxaan rabay inaan mid cuno.
It's really bad.	Runtii aad bay u xun tahay.
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
More than a few times, even.	In ka badan dhowr jeer, xitaa.
I had to work	Waxay ahayd inaan shaqeeyo
I have never been in one place for a long time.	Weligay hal meel ma joogin muddo dheer.
I don't want to do it.	Ma rabo inuu sameeyo.
That is, so far.	Taasi waa, ilaa hadda.
She would come.	Way iman lahayd.
I told them to do nothing	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay waxba ka qaban
I know he was surprised	Waan ogahay inuu yaabay
That is.	Taasi waa.
Now, let me see.	Hadda, aan arko.
I need to know if you did	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado haddii aad samaysay
As everyone does, really.	Sida qof walba sameeyo, runtii.
It's good to talk.	Way fiican tahay in la hadlo.
Not sure he wants to do it.	Ma hubo inuu doonayo inuu sameeyo.
I know it is very good	Waan ogahay inay aad u fiican tahay
I want someone to eat here	Waxaan rabaa inaan qof ku cuno halkan
I came out.	Waan ka soo baxay.
I can say that it is very good.	Waxaan sheegi karaa inay aad u fiican tahay.
I had to do something else	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo wax kale
And it’s not very good stuff, either.	Oo ma aha waxyaabo aad u fiican, sidoo kale.
I know this is true for me.	Waan ogahay in tani run tahay aniga.
I need to go home	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan guriga aado
Do not return here.	Halkan ha ku soo noqon.
I did that with you today	Taas ayaan kula sameeyay maanta
And when he does, it may not be the same.	Oo marka uu sameeyo, laga yaabaa in aanu la mid noqon.
I know better than I do not know	Waan ogahay si ka fiican inaanan ogayn
I have nothing to give	Wax la i siiyay ma hayo
Several things came from this	Waxyaabo dhowr ah ayaa tan ka yimid
Above all, it needs food.	Wax kasta oo ka badan, waxay u baahan tahay cunto.
I would do whatever she said	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta oo ay tidhi
I knew it was great here.	Waan ogaa inay aad u fiican tahay halkan.
Maybe I have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan haysto.
It would hurt to lie.	Been wax yeeli lahaa.
More so as he is unable to pick up anything.	Si ka sii badan sida uusan awoodin inuu wax soo qaado.
I knew I wouldn’t be here for long	Waan ogaa inaanan halkan joogi doonin wax aad u dheer
It looks the same.	Waxay u egtahay mid la mid ah.
I had to work the way it was done	Waxay ahayd inaan ka shaqeeyo sidii loo sameeyay
In fact, it was beautiful.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd qurux badan.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I want to go home well	Waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado si wanaagsan
I only love good people	Waxaan jeclahay kaliya dadka wanaagsan
They really are.	Waxay runtii yihiin.
I have never seen anything like it.	Waligiis ma arag wax la mid ah.
To do so is unnecessary.	In sidaas la sameeyo waa wax aan loo baahnayn.
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
I wondered if anyone would still be there	Waxaan la yaabay haddii qof weli halkaas joogi doono
I will not talk about it again, friend	Mar dambe ka hadli maayo, saaxiib
There was a lot of work and very little time.	Waxaa jiray shaqo badan oo waqti aad u yar leh.
That can take several years.	Taasi waxay qaadan kartaa dhowr sano.
I don't even think that's right.	Xitaa uma maleynayo in taasi sax tahay.
I can tell you a good time	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa waqti fiican
I saw someone else	Waxaan arkay qof kale
I was in so much trouble.	Waxaan ahaa dhibaato aad u badan.
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
I really do not understand	Runtii ma fahmin
I need to see you soon	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko dhawaan
But there was always something.	Laakiin mar walba wax ayaa jiray.
He knows very well who he is.	Aad buu u garanayaa cidda uu yahay.
What is the biggest.	Maxaa ugu weyn .
What a period.	Maxaa muddo ah.
That is required.	Taasi waa la rabaa.
All, all, all.	Dhammaan, dhammaan, dhammaan.
Maybe it won't be home tonight	Malaha caawa guriga ma ahaan doono
This is really new.	Runtii tani waa waa cusub.
Not only that.	Kaliya ma jirto.
I have never done that	Taas weligay maan samayn
I really know what I do to help you	Runtii waan garanayaa waxa aan sameeyo si aan kuu caawiyo
It's all a lie.	Dhammaan waa been.
But you are now.	Laakiin adiga ayaa hadda ah.
I want you to stay that way	Waxaan rabaa inaad sidaas ku sii jirto
I really did not like it	Run ahaantii maan jeclayn
That was a good thing	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa wanaagsan
It is not long.	Muddo dheer ma aha.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
That would really be something.	Taasi runtii waxay ahaan lahayd wax.
I looked	waan eegay
I want to see him at home	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko inuu guriga joogo
It was a beautiful day but very long.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan laakiin aad u dheer.
I do not want anyone else close to me	Ma doonayo qof kale oo ii dhow
I am busy.	Mashquul baan ahay.
I did the same	sidaas oo kale ayaan ku sameeyay
I can't do it now	Ma samayn karo hadda
They love you there.	Waxay ku jecel yihiin halkaas.
I told you they would come for you	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay kuu iman doonaan
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
Maybe he told her to come home.	Ma laga yaabaa inuu u sheegay inuu guriga yimaado.
It was nothing else.	Wax kale ma ahayn.
It may be the same for me.	Waxay igu noqon kartaa wax la mid ah aniga.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Waxba ma aha in aan waxba la qaban.
I would like to help you more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku caawiyo wax ka badan
That is the most common.	Taasi waa tan ugu badan.
He should get it right away.	Waa inuu si degdeg ah u helo.
Are there more cars?	Ma jiraa baabuur badan?.
I just don't want to.	Kaliya ma doonayo.
They may not even know she is here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa ogeyn inay halkan joogto.
You really did.	Runtii waad samaysay.
It is all true.	Dhammaan waa run.
I wanted you to know what happened	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato waxa dhacay
I will tell you how to do this	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa sida tan loo sameeyo
I put it home	Guriga ayaan iska dhigay
I need someone there	Waxaan u baahanahay qof halkaas joogo
I told him everything	Wax walba waan u sheegay
He gave everything.	Wax walba wuu siin jiray.
They will do the same.	Waxay samayn doonaan sidaas oo kale.
Not really you.	Runtii adiga maaha.
I just can't take it	Kaliya ma qaadan karo
But he did not do this.	Laakiin tan ma uu samayn.
I know it's the same for you	Waan ogahay inay isku mid kugu tahay
I think it will be a lot	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay wax badan noqon doonto
He is good at what he does.	Wuu ku fiican yahay waxa uu sameeyo.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
But it is not always difficult	Laakiin had iyo jeer si adag maaha
I had a good time doing it	Waqti fiican ayaan ku qaatay samaynta
Maybe I thought you would see that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u maleeyay inaad taas arki doonto.
Now I have heard.	Hadda ayaan maqlay.
I really knew what I was going to see.	Run ahaantii waan ogaa waxa aan arki doono.
Not so, not anymore.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale, mar dambe maaha.
I told you so.	sidaas ayaan kuu sheegay.
I am very happy to eat.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan wax cuno.
Why is it so consistent.	Waa maxay sababta ay si joogto ah u tahay.
I know he loves me.	Waan ogahay inuu i jecel yahay.
I am not here to do that.	Uma ihi halkan inaan taas sameeyo.
I hope they will be together.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay wada joogi doonaan.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
Tell them that.	U sheeg taas.
I have a job for him	Waxaan u hayaa shaqo
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
I do everything for you	Wax walba waan kuu sameeyaa
It was not a lie.	Been ma ahayn.
It's work.	Waa shaqo.
I think he may still be a little busy	Waxaan u malaynayaa in laga yaabo inuu weli wax yar mashquul yahay
There is so much to say.	Wax badan oo la sheegi karo ayaa jira.
I look forward to working with him.	Aad ayaan u rajeynayaa inaan la shaqeeyo isaga.
I don't even know how to do that.	Xitaa ma garanayo sida aad taas u samayn lahayd.
But it really didn’t matter if he did.	Laakiin runtii dhib ma lahayn haddii uu sameeyay.
I am very sorry.	Aad iyo aad ayaan uga xumahay.
Not just me, but everyone.	Aniga kaliya maaha, laakiin qof walba.
Surely that cannot happen again.	Hubaal taasi mar kale ma dhici karto.
I would like him to know what he can do	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu ogaado wuxuu awoodo
Maybe this is luck.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay tahay nasiib.
I will leave here shortly.	Waxaan halkan ka bixi doonaa waqti yar ka dib.
I wonder if it is always so.	Waxaan la yaabanahay had iyo jeer waa sidaas.
I can't believe he will do this	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan samayn doono
Not at all.	Maaha.
But she was a man.	Laakiin waxay ahayd nin.
I told him to go now	Waxaan u sheegay inuu hadda tago
Everyone thinks so.	Qof kastaa sidaas ayuu qabaa.
I told him that	Taas ayaan ugu sheegay
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
That is until recently.	Taasi waa ilaa dhawaan.
I want to stay	Waxaan rabaa inaan joogo
It is a lie.	Waa been.
I just want to see	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko
Do not think she has.	Ha u malayn inay leedahay.
Tonight, it is not.	Caawa, sidaas maaha.
In fact, the making is really great.	Dhab ahaantii, samaynta ayaa runtii aad u fiican.
I think it came out for me	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu ii soo baxay
He had.	Wuu lahaa.
This was difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid adag.
I can take time and work	Waxaan qaadan karaa waqti iyo shaqada
Then I did not see	Ka dib maan arag
I think it was real	Waxaan filayaa inay dhab ka ahayd
I don't think so, but maybe.	U malayn maayo, laakiin waa laga yaabaa.
Now I have a friend	Hadda waxaan leeyahay saaxiib
Here is why.	Waa kan sababta.
I did not have a very good time	Ma aanan haysan waqti aad u fiican
I can do something to help you now	Waxaan sameyn karaa wax aan ku caawiyo hadda
Lots of great stuff here.	Waxyaabo badan oo aad u fiican halkan.
I didn't know they were things but they are very good.	Ma garanayn inay wax yihiin laakiin aad bay u fiican yihiin.
It looks like that.	Waxay u egtahay sidaas.
Nice to be here !.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto!.
I want to help you find out who made it	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa caawiyo inaad ogaato cidda samaysay
It was not.	Ma aysan ahayn.
I want to be there to help with that	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas joogo si aan taas ku caawiyo
He did not take anything.	Waxba kama uu qaadan.
I can do it here	Waxaan ka qaban karaa halkan
Please let everyone help me.	Fadlan qof kasta ha i caawiyo.
He has not yet received it.	Weli ma uusan helin.
I was surprised, but not really	Waxaan la yaabay, laakiin si dhab ah uma ahayn
I know this is hard for you	Waan ogahay in tani kugu adag tahay
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I was lucky.	Nasiib baan lahaa.
We will do everything we can to help.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa wax kasta oo aan ku caawin karno.
It was definitely quick.	Hubaal waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
I just have to	Kaliya waa inaan haysto
Very hard work.	Shaqo aad u adag.
So far, no problem.	Ilaa hadda, dhib ma leh.
I want this with you	Tan ayaan kula rabaa
I went out and bought it	Waan baxay oo iibsaday
I'm really not surprised.	Runtii ma ihi yaab.
He was amazing, he was really amazing.	Waxa uu ahaa mid la yaab leh, run ahaantii waxa uu ahaa mid aad u yaab leh.
I found it here	Waan ka helay halkan
I think that is beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi qurux badan tahay
They could not have come for a better time.	Ma aysan iman karin waqti ka wanaagsan.
I still think that is true	Weli waxaan qabaa in taasi run tahay
Someone else did.	Qof kale ayaa sameeyay.
She knew it was going to happen.	Way ogaatay inay dhici doonto.
Maybe he is here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu halkan joogo.
I can't go home anymore	Ma aadi karo guriga mar dambe
I once thought it was beautiful	Waxaan mar u maleeyay inuu qurux badan yahay
You would really be good at that.	Runtii waad ku fiicnaan lahayd taas.
I would not say.	Ma odhan lahaa.
He was really surprised.	Runtii wuu yaabay.
He says it is done	Waxa uu yidhi waa la sameeyaa
Maybe it was true there was nothing to do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay run ahayd ma jirin wax la sameeyo.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I am in a very bad place.	Waxaan ku jiraa meel aad u xun.
He said he wanted to do it for me.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu doonayo in uu aniga ii sameeyo.
I decided that was not a bad thing	Waxaan go'aansaday in taasi aysan ahayn wax xun
You will surely love it.	Runtii waad jeclaan doontaa.
He has no friends.	Saaxiibo ma leh.
I really have no idea what he said	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto wuxuu yidhi
No one can love it now.	Qofna hadda ma jeclaan karo.
I think he is serious	Waxaan filayaa inuu dhab ka yahay
She would go home.	Waxay aadi lahayd guriga.
A little, and he said it was nothing.	In yar, oo wuxuu sheegay in aanay waxba ahayn.
I was surprised she could tell me	Waxaan la yaabay inay ii sheegi karto
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
But I could not say anything.	Laakiin waxba ma odhan karin.
I really did not see that coming	Run ahaantii maan arag in soo socda
I have no problem doing this.	Wax dhib ah kama qabo in tan la igu sameeyo.
I love helping people	Waxaan jeclahay inaan dadka caawiyo
It was very difficult and difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan oo adag.
I look forward to talking to you again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale kula hadlo
Obviously, we need something better.	Sida cad, waxaan u baahanahay wax ka fiican.
I have to stay home.	Waa inaan guriga joogo.
That's what.	Taasi waa waxa.
Much can be done.	Wax badan ayaa la qaban karaa.
I have to know where he is, if he is alive	Waa inaan ogaado meesha uu joogo, haddii uu nool yahay
It's hard enough.	Way adag tahay in ku filan.
I did not want to have anything else	Wax kale ma rabin inaan haysto
I did not understand.	Anigu ma aan fahmin.
Sure everyone does.	Hubaal qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
For me, she did.	Aniga ahaan, way samaysay.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax ma aha.
I can give you another	Mid kale ayaan ku siin karaa
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
I do the same things as he does	Waxaan sameeyaa waxyaabo la mid ah waxa uu sameeyo
Everything is better than nothing.	Wax kasta ayaa ka fiican in aan waxba samayn.
I could not even see	Xitaa maan arki karin
It is now done.	Hadda waa la sameeyay.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I don't know if that is true.	Ma garanayo inay taasi run tahay.
I need to learn from it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax ka barto
He really liked it.	Runtii wuu ka helay.
I really wanted to know	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan ogaado
He is not here today.	Maanta halkan ma joogto.
They will not help me.	Ima caawin doonaan.
I doubt he can see me	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu i arki karo
I have nothing else to say	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan sheego
But this is.	Laakiin tani waa.
This is the same as before.	Tani waxay la mid tahay hore.
Unable to help.	Waa la caawin waayay.
Not often.	Inta badan ma aha.
I like!!.	waan jeclahay!!.
It can come at any time.	Waxay iman kartaa wakhti kasta.
As he expected.	Sidii uu filan lahaa.
Don't make money.	Lacag ha ka samayn.
I would love to see more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan arko.
I did, a few years ago	Waxaan sameeyay, dhowr sano ka hor
I hold you for a long time	Waxaan ku hayaa waqti dheer
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I suspect he will talk about it	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inuu ka hadli doono
It can be very difficult.	Wuxuu noqon karaa mid aad u adag.
I wanted to be back	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale noqdo
It was mostly enough.	Waxay ahayd inta badan ku filan.
I just want to see what it looks like now	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko sida ay hadda u egtahay
I still want to see you	Wali waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko
Maybe three.	Malaha waa saddex.
And certainly not.	Oo hubaal taas maaha.
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma helin.
I'm just happy to be there.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaas joogo.
I did very little.	Waxaan sameeyay wax aad u yar.
He has nothing to say.	Wax uu u sheego ma jiro.
I have to know what happened to him	Waa inaan ogaado waxa ku dhacay
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I do that sometimes.	Mar mar ayaan taas sameeyaa.
He picked it up.	Wuu ka soo qaaday.
And a good job for this.	Iyo shaqo wanaagsan oo tan ah.
I still love you too	Wali waan ku jeclahay sidoo kale
I thought it was beautiful	Waxaan u maleeyay inay qurux badan tahay
Definitely not the best.	Dhab ahaantii maaha kan ugu fiican.
I did everything	Wax walba waan sameeyay
I think one of us needs it now	Waxaan filayaa in mid naga mid ah uu hadda ii baahan yahay
To leave was to leave.	In la baxo waxay ahayd inaan baxo.
I wanted, more	Waxaan rabay, wax ka badan
It really didn't help much	Runtii wax badan kama caawin
So, I can't say.	Marka, ma sheegi karo.
That's when it's a lie.	Waa marka ay been tahay.
I did not know why.	Maan garanayn sababta.
I really wanted to talk	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan hadlo
Go over and over again.	Si aad u badan u mar.
That was not so long ago.	Taasi ma aha sidaas dheer ka hor.
I should have known	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado
He just does.	Kaliya wuu sameeyaa.
Maybe it is.	Malaha waa.
available. 	wuu heli karaa. 
I will definitely do it.	Runtii waan yeeli doonaa.
This is a good idea for me.	Tani waxay ila tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
I think we will see	Waxaan filayaa inaan arki doono
There is a lot to talk about.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo laga hadlo.
I got it again.	Mar kale ayaan ku helay.
I have not seen this before	Maan arag tan markii hore
I know it is true for me	Waan ogahay inay aniga run tahay
It was a long time coming.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer soo socda.
Obviously it could be.	Sida cad waxay noqon kartaa.
I will not believe this	Ma rumaysan doono tan
I wanted to learn more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan barto
He will do the same.	Si la mid ah ayuu yeeli doonaa.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
I spent a lot of time here.	Waqti badan ayaa halkan ku qaatay.
I got him to talk.	Waa ku helay inuu hadlo.
I can't always stay longer	Mar walba ma joogi karo waqti dheer
I can see it so far.	Waan arki karaa ilaa hadda.
I would love to go.	Waxaan jeclahay in aan u tago.
It's time.	Waa wakhti.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
I would love to see that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko taas.
The main reason is so.	Sababta ugu weyn waa sidaas oo kale.
That's how he knew.	Sidaas ayuu ku ogaa.
This is a good idea, but it is not true.	Tani waa fikrad fiican, laakiin run maaha.
They are who they are.	Waa cidda ay yihiin.
For a while no one saw him.	In muddo ah cidna ma uu arag.
He thinks.	Wuxuu qabaa.
Ideally, the latter.	Fikrad ahaan, kan dambe.
But really, it is not.	Laakiin run ahaantii, ma aha.
But too much is bad.	Laakiin aad u badan ayaa xun.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
A little time.	Waqti yar.
I can do new things with it	Waxaan ku samayn karaa waxyaabo cusub
Excellent job, really	Shaqo aad u fiican, run ahaantii
Something is going on.	Wax baa socda.
I just need to know what to do	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxaan sameeyo
I came back, he was there	Waan soo noqday, wuu joogay
Now home.	Hadda guriga.
It’s not that you won’t do it.	Ma aha inaadan samayn doonin.
That is why I am so happy.	Taasi waa sababta aan aad ugu faraxsanahay.
I saw it again.	Mar kale ayaan arkay.
I would like him to stay with me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu ila joogo
All the more reason to do	Sababta oo dhan in ka badan in la sameeyo
I did not know this.	Anigu ma aan ogayn tan.
I heard one.	Mid baan maqlay.
I wish you would see me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad i arki lahayd
This is exactly what would happen.	Tani waa dhab ahaan waxa dhici lahaa.
I just want you to be happy	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad faraxsan tahay
It just won’t happen.	Kaliya ma dhici doonto.
Very, very.	Aad iyo aad.
You cannot go home.	Guriga ma aadi kartid.
He is a loving person.	Waa qof jecel.
I wondered why it didn't come to me	Waxaan la yaabay muxuu ii iman waayay
It's another time.	Waa wakhti kale.
, but it will not happen.	, laakiin ma dhici doonto.
She said for sure.	Waxay tidhi hubaal.
I did not do the work	Anigu maan qaban shaqada
And so on, and so forth.	Iyo wixii la mid ah, iyo wixii la mid ah.
I suspect he does.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu sameeyo.
I really hope to see you again	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale arko
I still couldn't believe he said that to me	Weli waan rumaysan waayay inuu sidaas igu yidhi
Not even a little.	Ma aha xitaa in yar.
I love him so much for doing that for him	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga si aan taas isaga u sameeyo
I will never do such a thing again	Wax sidaas oo kale ah mar dambe ma samayn doono
I'm glad she did.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay samaysay.
Maybe I know what it is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan garanayo waxa uu yahay.
Maybe he is.	Malaha wuu yahay.
He was obviously very bad.	Waxa uu ahaa sida iska cad si aad u xun.
I did not want him to be a person	Maan rabin inuu qof noqdo
Maybe you can tell us what he said about that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad noo sheegto waxa uu ka yidhi taas.
I never liked him.	Weligay ma jecli isaga.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
Besides, it looks really, really good.	Marka laga soo tago, waxay u egtahay runtii, aad u wanaagsan.
I tried the door but it didn't work	Waxaan isku dayay albaabka laakiin ma noqon
I was in prison with you.	xabsiga ayaan kula jiray.
Everything you really need.	Wax kasta oo aad runtii u baahan tahay.
I am not the same person now.	Hadda isku qof ma ihi.
I just want a chance to talk to you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa fursad aan kula hadlo
He did not want to leave	Ma rabin inuu baxo
Maybe not everyone.	Laga yaabaa in aan qof walba.
But it was not.	Laakiin ma ay ahayn.
You can't get both.	Labaduba ma heli kartid.
I was still trying to work out everything that happened	Waxaan wali isku dayay inaan ka shaqeeyo wax walba oo dhacay
I will do every job.	Waxaan qaban doonaa shaqo kasta.
He did not come.	Ma uusan iman.
I am nothing.	Anigu waxba ma ihi.
I doubt he would make a car	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in baabuur samayn lahaa
I thought she was with you	Waxaan u maleeyay inay kula jirto
I was constantly amazed by this	Waxaan si joogto ah ula yaabay tan
Not a bad day job.	Ma aha shaqo maalin xun.
He did not leave.	Ma uusan bixin.
I have not seen much	In badan ma arag
Good idea, no.	Fikrad fiican, ma aha.
I have done that so far	Taas waan sameeyay ilaa hadda
No one can be present	Qofna hadda lama joogi karo
Please tell me something	Fadlan wax ii sheeg
He thinks they are too many.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inay aad u badan yihiin.
Give me a little.	Wax yar i sii.
He said a lot.	Wax badan buu yidhi.
Looks like that's what you have.	Waxay u egtahay in taasi tahay waxa aad leedahay.
Someone needs you.	Qof baa kuu baahan.
Still mostly found.	Weli inta badan waa helay.
I do not know how they do it	Ma garanayo sida ay u sameeyaan
I am very serious.	Aad baan u dhab ahay.
I just couldn't find it	Kaliya waan heli waayay
I have no problem with that either.	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo taas sidoo kale.
You are lucky.	Nasiib baad leedahay.
I could not let him speak	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu hadlo
let me know if you need anything.	ii sheeg haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
he was not the same man	isku nin ma ahayn
I thought it was good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay u wanaagsan tahay
Not too and.	Aan sidoo kale iyo.
But maybe for a while.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa in muddo ah.
Not anymore, he thought.	Mar dambe ma aha, ayuu u maleeyay.
Everything is coming now, now, now.	Wax walba hadda soo socda, hadda, hadda.
I knew they weren’t coming for me.	Waan ogaa inaysan ii iman.
I know what you will get	Waan ogahay waxaad heli doonto
He came back.	Dib ayuu u soo noqday.
There is definitely a lot of truth in it.	Waxaa hubaal ah in run badan ay ku jirto.
The proximity is bad.	U dhow ayaa xun.
One is true if the other is.	Mid waa run haddii kan kale yahay.
He just left.	Kaliya wuu ka tagay.
What is it.	Waa maxay.
I saw everything	Wax walba waan arkay
Not a little.	Wax yar ma aha.
Not much else.	Wax badan oo kale maaha.
But no one knows.	Laakiin qofna waxba ma garanayo.
I haven't seen it before, but you are	Maan arag markii hore, laakiin waad tahay
I think it is the best	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ugu fiican tahay
This is a terrible thing.	Tani waa wax aad u xun.
I tried and did well	Waan isku dayay oo si fiican ayaan u sameeyay
They will stay together.	Way wada joogi doonaan.
I would tell him why first.	Ma u sheegi lahaa sababta marka hore.
This cannot be.	Tani ma noqon karto.
I saw everything as well.	Waxaan arkay wax walba sidoo kale.
I was him.	isaga ayaan ahaa.
I knew he had to go somewhere	Waan ogaa inay tahay inuu meel aado
But three is too much.	Laakiin saddex ayaa aad u badan.
I can always help you, you know	Mar walba waan ku caawin karaa, waad ogtahay
He felt he was there to help.	Wuxuu dareemay inuu u joogo inuu caawiyo.
He has something to say.	Wuxuu leeyahay wax uu ku hadlo.
I didn't have to work	Ma ahayn inaan shaqeeyo
They are long.	Way dheer yihiin.
Now it was fun.	Hadda waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
That could be the same.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sidoo kale.
I thought it was still there	Waxaan mooday inuu weli jiro
To talk.	In la wada hadlo.
It doesn't look real.	Wax dhab ah uma eka.
I desperately need it.	Aad baan ugu baahanahay.
I will never go there again.	Mar dambe ma aadi doono halkaas.
I need you to do this for me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad tan ii sameyso
I haven't caught him yet you know	Wali maan qaban isaga waad ogtahay
I think that is not surprising	Waxaan filayaa in aanay taasi la yaab lahayn
I went home.	Guriga ayaan aaday.
Anyone who would find me.	Qof kasta oo i heli lahaa.
I have to leave you	Waa inaan kaa tago
First, but then.	Marka hore, laakiin ka dib.
I knew this was true	Waan ogaa in tani ay run tahay
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
Good day.	Maalin wanaagsan.
I did not want to talk to anyone	Ma rabin inaan cidna la hadlo
I will never leave you again.	Mar dambe kaa tagi maayo.
I did not enter	Ma galay
I have already gone so far	Hore ayaan u aaday ilaa hadda
I'm sure of this	Waan hubaa tan
I need to keep it together	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wada hayo
he could not find.	wuu heli waayay.
I came back tonight.	Waxaan soo noqday caawa.
No one is walking here.	Ma jiro qof halkan ku socda.
Definitely more and more.	Waxaa hubaal ah in aad iyo aad u badan.
I do not know how, yet	Ma garanayo sida, weli
But it is good every day.	Laakiin way ku fiican tahay maalin kasta.
But it will not.	Laakiin ma yeeli doonto.
That is the only thing.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya.
I do not feel right	Ma dareemayo sax
I don't like it.	Ma jecli in ay tahay.
I think they do things to make money	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay sameeyaan waxyaabo ay lacag ku sameeyaan
Most of the time it will not happen.	Inta badan ma dhici doonto.
He just didn’t get it.	Kaliya ma uusan helin.
I'm really a little bit here	Waxaan dhab ka ahay halkan in yar
Three years.	Saddex sano.
Good, but just that	Mid wanaagsan, laakiin kaliya taas
I know this is hard for you.	Waan ogahay in tani ay kugu adag tahay.
I need to learn	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax barto
I don't think they do	Uma maleynayo inay sameeyaan
I know, he thought.	Waan ogahay, ayuu u maleeyay.
I felt surprised by this	Waxaan dareemay la yaabay arrintan
Any time now.	Waqti kasta hadda.
I knew she loved him, but still	Waan ogaa inay jeceshahay isaga, laakiin weli
I am afraid of what would happen	Waxaan ka baqayaa waxa dhici lahaa
I could not tell him.	Waan u sheegi waayay.
He appeared.	Wuxuu u muuqday .
I do not know what to do and where to go	Waxaan sameeyo iyo meel aan aado ma garanayo
He is a friend.	Waa saaxiib.
She has a great friend	Waxay leedahay saaxiib weyn
I knew it was great	Waan ogaa inay ahayd mid weyn
I want to be here and now	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan iyo hadda joogo
There is so much, really.	Wax badan ayaa jira, runtii.
I wondered and wondered what it could be	Waan yaabay oo waxaan la yaabay waxa ay noqon karto
She said she was happy.	Waxay sheegtay inay faraxsan tahay.
I still have no idea what is going on	Wali wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxa socda
I can see what happened	Waan arki karaa waxa dhacay
I would like to tell you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan u sheego
Absolutely.	Dhab ahaan.
I did not want to	Maan rabin
I really thought he could not	Waxaan runtii mooday inuusan awoodin
What does that look like.	Sidee taasi u egtahay.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
In aan.	In aanu.
He liked it.	Wuu ka helay.
But it looks good.	Laakiin waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
You do not have to	Uma baahnid
I don't want more	Ma rabo wax ka badan
Close friend, it's old	Saaxiib dhow, waa hore
I think it would be great.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan lahayd.
Good, really.	Wanaagsan, dhab ahaantii.
They did not do much better.	Wax aad uga wanaagsan ma aysan qaban.
There is so much to learn and learn.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la barto oo la barto.
I did not get it	Anigu ma aan helin
I would say otherwise	si kale ayaan u sheegi lahaa
Great man.	Nin weyn.
I came back to find out	Waxaan u soo noqday inaan is ogaado
Am I sorry for everything I did.	Ma ka xumahay wax kasta oo aan sameeyay.
I did not see him come back	Ma arag isaga oo soo noqday
A man like you can be very helpful	Nin adiga oo kale ah aad buu ii caawin karaa
I became one.	Waxaan ka mid noqday.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I didn’t get a chance to get to know her better	Maan helin fursad aan si fiican u garanayo
He didn't want to say.	Ma uusan rabin inuu sheego.
I looked at him again, I really looked at him	Mar kale ayaan eegay, runtii isaga ayaan eegay
This was a bad idea.	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
He left me.	Wuu ii baxay.
It would be a place.	Meel bay ku noqon lahayd.
I really wanted to be there	Runtii waan ku rabay halkaas
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
I know what you want to do	Waan ogahay waxaad rabto inaad sameyso
I can't even stay in one place for long	Xitaa hal meel ma joogi karo muddo dheer
I love the way you are with me	Waan jeclahay sida aad ila joogto
This was much true, but it was nothing else.	Tani wax badan run bay ahayd, laakiin wax kale ma ahayn.
I really would like them to do	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay sameeyaan
I knew they would not believe me	Waan ogaa in aysan i rumaysan doonin
I know what he likes	Waan ogahay waxa uu jecel yahay
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
This is the same as a year ago.	Tani waxay la mid tahay hal sano ka hor.
This was every day.	Tani waxay ahayd maalin kasta.
I will do something else	wax kale ayaan samayn doonaa
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
For a long time.	Muddo dheer.
He is really good.	Runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
And the same.	Oo isku mid ah.
Maybe he didn't like it.	Malaha wuu jeclaan waayay.
I make more money than he does	Waxaan sameeyaa lacag ka badan inta uu sameeyo
I knew it existed	Waan ogaa inay jirto
I will tell you this again.	Mar kale ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa tan.
I will not hurt you again	Mar dambe ku yeeli maayo
Let me buy one.	Aan ku iibsado mid.
I told him to come out	Waxaan u sheegay inuu soo baxo
I would not stay on this	Anigu ma aan sii joogi lahaa arrintan
He really does.	Runtii wuu sameeyaa.
for sure.	hubaal ahaan.
I would love to see that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko taas
I can't speak.	Ma hadli karo.
i love you where you are	waan ku jeclahay meesha aad joogto
Nothing happened.	Wax iska dhacay maaha.
I got a long day job tomorrow	Waxaan helay shaqo maalin dheer berri
Why she found out how to get it, too.	Sababta ay u ogaatay sida loo helo, sidoo kale.
This is required.	Tani waa loo baahan yahay.
You can find it here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
And, obviously no one can do this for long.	Iyo, sida iska cad qofna ma samayn karo tan muddo dheer.
No one knew who we were	Qofna ma garanayn cidda aanu nahay
They are difficult.	Way ku adag yihiin.
I do not understand very well	Aad uma fahmin
I can't do anything.	waxba ma samayn karo.
Are you happy now?	Hadda miyaad faraxsan tahay?.
I think he loves you	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku jecel yahay
That can be anything.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
I knew it was true	Waan ogaa inay run tahay
You really shouldn’t.	Runtii waa inaadan.
I gave you very little time	Waxaan ku siiyay waqti aad u yar
Everyone did.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyay.
I was a friend to him	Waxaan u ahaa saaxiib
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
That was a bad idea.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
This is not like real work.	Tani maaha sida shaqo dhab ah.
Just over a year.	In yar ka badan hal sano.
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samayn doono.
You will need something else.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa wax kale.
I can still see it now	Weli waan arki karaa hadda
I would like something to go on	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax socda
I did not believe that	Maan rumaysan taas
I don't think so.	U malayn maayo inay taasi tahay.
I told him, no one.	Waxaan u sheegay, qofna.
Like really bad.	Sida runtii xun.
Tell me what you want me to say.	Ii sheeg waxaad rabto inaan sheego.
I didn't need food.	Uma baahnayn cunto.
I am just like you	waxaan ahay adiga oo kale
I want to know how it is	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida ay taasi tahay
I wanted her to stay	Waxaan rabay inay joogto
But it has to be done.	Laakiin waa in la sameeyaa.
I can't believe it, but you did	Ma rumaysan karo, laakiin waad samaysay
I'm a little sorry and this has to be done	Waan ka xumahay in yar oo tani waa in la sameeyaa
It's a beautiful idea.	Waa fikrad qurux badan.
He really wants it	Runtii aad buu u rabaa
But he tried several times.	Laakiin dhowr jeer ayuu isku dayay.
I would love to be there again one day	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas joogo mar kale maalin
One hard.	Mid adag.
I really got a lot.	Runtii wax badan ayaan helay.
I think he thought you said that	Waxaan filayaa inuu u maleeyay inaad tidhi
Stop everyone, please.	Qof kastaa jooji, fadlan.
But that is not the case	Laakiin sidaas maaha
He was very visible.	Aad ayuu u muuqday.
I had a job.	Waxaan lahaa shaqo.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I seem to have fallen for it.	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan aad u dhacay.
I can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karo.
I didn't think he wanted to talk about it	Uma malaynayn inuu rabo inuu ka hadlo
Even if he doesn’t, really.	Xitaa haddii uusan samayn, dhab ahaantii.
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
Everyone loves you.	Qof kastaa wuu ku jecel yahay.
It was good food.	Waxay ahayd cunto wanaagsan.
Not done.	Lama samayn.
I don't think that can happen.	U malayn maayo inay taasi dhici karto.
He did not do that.	Taas ma uu samayn.
I do not think this is a problem	Uma maleynayo in tani ay tahay dhibaato
I never really said I was sorry.	Waligiis run ahaantii ma odhan waan ka xumahay.
I wanted you to know that	Waxaan rabay inaad taas ogaato
I really wanted to talk to him.	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo.
That is what he wants.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabo.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
I tried	waan isku dayay
I was very impressed with this	Aad ayaan ula dhacay arrintan
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
I came back to help.	Dib baan u soo noqday si aan u caawiyo.
Really long time indeed.	Runtii waqti dheer runtii.
That doesn't really look right.	Taasi run ahaantii sax uma eka.
he wondered.	ayuu is waydiiyay.
But everyone did everything.	Laakiin qof kastaa wax walba wuu sameeyay.
I am him.	aniga ayaa ah isaga.
He found me interesting.	Wuxuu iga helay mid xiiso leh.
I really had no idea he had one	Run ahaantii wax fikrad ah kama helin inuu mid leeyahay
It can be anything.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
Everyone and everything else did.	Qof kasta iyo wax kasta oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
Not much to do, but something.	Ma aha wax badan in la sameeyo, laakiin wax.
Maybe not everyone, but it did for me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan qof walba, laakiin waxay ii samaysay aniga.
It is, like, very popular.	Waa, sida, aad loo jecel yahay.
It is an opportunity for you.	Waxay kuu tahay fursad.
You must be happy.	Waa inaad faraxsan tahay.
They love it.	Way jecel yihiin.
I would assume that this is the same	Waxaan u qaadan lahaa in tani ay la mid tahay
I decided to do that.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan taas sameeyo.
It was something new.	Waxay ahayd wax cusub.
He is still there.	Weli wuu joogaa.
I will not do that	Taas ku samayn maayo
That is a good idea.	Taasi waa fikrad wanaagsan.
He couldn't help it.	Ma uusan caawin karin.
I look forward to seeing you there !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkaas!.
I'm not sure they will happen today.	Ma hubo inay maanta dhici doonaan.
But I do not have much.	Laakiin aad u badan ayaan haysan.
I felt the same way.	Aniga oo kale ayaan dareemay.
I have to want that for you	Waa inaan taas kuu rabaa
He thought he would get something.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inuu wax heli doono.
They love him there.	Waxay ku jecel yihiin isaga halkaas.
We would love that.	Waan jeclaan lahayn taas.
I wondered why she did it	Waxaan la yaabay sababta ay sidaas u samaysay
I did not want to know any of this	Ma aanan rabin inaan mid ka mid ah kan ogaado
I can still do it	Wali waan samayn karaa
It was very good for me.	Waxay ii ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan.
Tell me everything.	Wax walba ii sheeg.
I had no idea about this	Wax fikrad ah kama aan lahayn arrintan
I was there for that.	Waxaan u joogay taas.
I told him it wasn’t enough time	Waxaan u sheegay in aysan ahayn waqti ku filan
I told her if she needed anything, she could come to me.	Waxaan u sheegay haddii ay wax u baahan tahay, way ii iman kartaa.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I never knew who.	Weligay maan garanayn cidda.
I tried to do more.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax badan sameeyo.
It's better for me to just talk to you.	Way ii fiican tahay inaan kula hadlo kaliya.
I am very sorry	Aad ayaan uga xumahay
I was told that this would go away over time.	Waxaa la ii sheegay in tani ay waqti ka dib tagi doonto.
I am that but a lot.	Anigu taas ayaan ahay laakiin aad u badan.
Not a good time.	Waqti fiican maaha.
Everyone has money.	Qof kastaa lacag buu leeyahay.
Everyone left.	Qof kastaa wuu baxay.
But it does not seem to have.	Laakiin uma eka in ay leedahay.
I loved school.	Waxaan jeclaan jiray dugsiga.
I have to say something.	Waa inaan wax sheego.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
I could not see very well	Si fiican wax uma arki karin
We will do better.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa si ka wanaagsan.
I think everyone knows who they are	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba garanayo cidda ay yihiin
take it from me.	iga qaado.
You really.	Adiga runtii.
I would do the same.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax la mid ah.
I was a good person.	Waxaan ahaa qof wanaagsan.
I really want him well	Runtii si fiican ayaan isaga rabaa
This cannot be good.	Tani ma noqon karto mid wanaagsan.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
And you should not.	Oo waa inaadan.
This will require a lot of work yet.	Tani waxay u baahan doontaa shaqo badan weli.
But he really came.	Laakiin runtii wuu yimid.
There was only one.	Waxaa jiray hal kaliya.
And it really does nothing.	Oo runtii waxba ma sameeyo.
All of me.	Aniga oo dhan.
I bought a little	In yar ayaan soo iibsaday
It's nothing but work, work, work.	Wax kale maaha ee waa shaqo, shaqo, shaqo.
He wants to know everything.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu wax walba ogaado.
I am very sorry about that	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
Now he is more than ever.	Hadda wuu ka badan yahay sidii hore.
I would tell you yesterday	Shalay baan kuu sheegi lahaa
Like me.	Aniga oo kale.
I can't now.	Hadda ma awoodo.
He should have left now for free.	Waxay ahayd in uu hadda ka tago lacag la'aan.
I found something good.	Waxaan helay wax fiican.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
And you would be.	Oo waxaad noqon lahayd.
I would be fine all the time	Waan fiicnaan lahaa mar walba
I think he knew, too	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu ogaa, sidoo kale
I know what you want	Waan ogahay waxaad rabto
I did not say.	Ma aan sheegin.
We will do it	Waanu samayn doonaa
I do things like that.	Waxaan sameeyaa waxyaabo sidaas oo kale ah.
I wish they did not do this	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aanay tan samayn
I would do anything for you	Wax walba waan kuu qaban lahaa
Nothing, he said.	Waxba, ayuu yidhi.
Something happened in the room.	Wax baa qolka ka dhacay.
It was right.	Waxay ahayd mid sax ah.
I really don't care.	Runtii waxba igama qabo.
I knew she was there	Waan ogaa inay halkaas joogto
More than a year ago.	In ka badan hal sano ka hor.
I want to be in this one	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku jiro kan
I hope it will be one	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu noqon doono mid
That is really the only thing that exists.	Runtii taasi waa waxa kaliya ee jira.
I would stay with you three.	Saddex baan kula joogi lahaa.
I want to go back soon	Waxaan rabaa inaan dib ugu noqdo dhawaan
I had a good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican.
I know you can do it clearly	Waan ogahay waxaad samayn karto si cad
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I didn't like him.	Ma aanan jeclayn isaga.
I have no intention of telling him	Wax niyad ah uma hayo inaan u sheego
That is what really happened to me.	Taasi waa waxa igu dhacay runtii.
I will even help.	Xitaa waan caawin doonaa.
He is not here now	Hadda ma joogo halkan
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
I really have to go now.	Runtii waa inaan aado hadda.
I would be fine	Waan ku fiicnaan lahaa
I would have left here soon	Dhawaan ayaan halkan ka bixi lahaa
They are ready and ready for work.	Waxay diyaar u yihiin oo diyaar u yihiin shaqada.
I am afraid of everything	Wax walba waan ka baqayaa
And also if it is.	Iyo sidoo kale haddii ay tahay.
He needs to work with you.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu la shaqeeyo.
I can't do anything	Waxba kama qaban karo
I really couldn’t find anything to do	Runtii maan helin wax aan sameeyo
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
I did not want to see	Maan rabin inaan arko
I could not see anything, I just heard	Waxba maan arki karin, kaliya waan maqlay
I wanted something quick and easy	Waxaan rabay wax degdeg ah oo degdeg ah
I can't get out of that	Taas kama bixi karo
I did not want to see.	Maan rabin inaan arko.
I did not have to stay long	Ma ahayn inaan sii joogo wakhti dheer
Probably the latter.	Malaha tan dambe.
Wherever you are.	Meel kasta oo aad joogto.
That is true, you know.	Taasi waa run, waad ogtahay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
Soon he would return home.	Wax yar ka dib wuxuu ku noqon lahaa guriga.
I wonder how she found out	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay taas ku ogaatay
I had a lot of friends there	Waxaan halkaas ku lahaa saaxiibo badan
Probably not.	Malaha waa in aanay ahayn.
I really have to go	Runtii waa inaan tago
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
I have never seen that before	Weligay taas hore uma arag
It's not really my job.	Runtii shaqo igama aha.
It was clear he really wanted to go.	Waxay ahayd cad inuu runtii doonayo inuu tago.
I just hope so often	Waxaan rajeynayaa kaliya inta badan
I think they like it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jecel yihiin
Luckily still.	Nasiib yar weli.
I will always love you	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa
It's too big.	Aad buu u weyn yahay.
I had to tell her something	Waxay ahayd inaan wax u sheego
It is right here.	Isla halkan ayaa jira.
I always refused.	Mar walba waan diiday.
I want to tell you something, too	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax kuu sheego, sidoo kale
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
I got a lot to learn	Waxaan helay wax badan oo aan barto
I knew she needed me	Waan ogaa inay ii baahan tahay
Still, money will be available.	Weli, lacag ayaa la heli doonaa.
I did not know for sure	Maan garanayn hubaal
I was not able to accurately, and consistently	Ma aan awoodin si sax ah, oo aan joogto ahayn
I knew this would happen too	Waan ogaa inay tani sidoo kale dhici doonto
I wanted to say something about it	Waxa aan rabay in aan wax ka sheego
That is true for me.	Taasi waa run aniga.
I hope you are very happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad aad u faraxsan tahay.
Anything other than what he is supposed to do.	Wax kasta oo aan ahayn waxa laga rabo inuu sameeyo.
One of the people.	Mid ka mid ah dadka.
I love doing it	Waan jeclahay inaan sameeyo
It should not have been held.	Ma ahayn in la haysto.
No one can talk	Qofna lama hadli karo
I need something like this.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax la mid ah kan.
I decided to find out why	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan ogaado sababta
It is still true today.	Wali waa run maanta.
I have never done anything wrong.	Weligay wax xun ma samayn.
It can even be good.	Xitaa way fiicnaan kartaa.
I hope this was something you were willing to do	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ahayd wax aad diyaar u ahayd inaad sameyso
One person said it would be a problem.	Hal qof ayaa sheegay in ay noqon doonto dhibaato.
I really did nothing.	Runtii waxba maan samayn.
I think it is even real	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay xitaa dhab ahaan tahay
I would love to see something else	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko wax kale
It's like now.	Waa sida hadda.
I would get it	waan heli lahaa
I started working on making one	Waxaan bilaabay inaan ka shaqeeyo samaynta mid
I did not want anyone to know	Maan rabin in qofna wax ka ogaado
I want to be such a good person.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof wanaagsan oo sidaas ah.
Not there.	Ma aha halkaas.
I am very skeptical	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay
I did everything he told me to do	Wax walba oo uu ii sheegay waan sameeyay
I do not want to say, but he is a great man.	Ma rabo inaan sheego, laakiin waa nin weyn.
I love him so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga
But maybe that is what is needed.	Laakiin malaha taasi waa waxa loo baahan yahay.
This is beautiful.	Tani waa qurux.
I was lucky.	Nasiib ayaan helay.
I can't speak right now	Ma hadli karo hadda
We need to do a better job of this.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan samayno shaqo ka wanaagsan tan.
This was one of them	Tani waxay ahayd mid ka mid ah
No one knows who he is.	Qofna ma garanayo qofka uu yahay.
Probably not.	Malaha ma jirin.
It looks like a lot.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u badan.
I hope you would do a better job	Waxaan filayaa inaad shaqo ka wanaagsan qaban lahayd
You can not help.	Ma caawin kartid.
That's what they do.	Taasi waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
If it were, he would just have to make it.	Haddii uu ahaan lahaa, waa inuu kaliya sameeyo.
There is a time.	Waqti ayaa jira.
I think it will be so	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas noqon doonto
This will be the same.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa isku mid.
I should have known that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas ogaado
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
It does not work for him	Uma shaqeeyo isaga
I didn't even get a chance to see it	Xitaa maan helin fursad aan ku arko
They are different.	Waxay kala yihiin.
I will not let him.	Uma ogolaan doono isaga.
I want you to know how best you can be happy	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato sida ugu fiican ee aad u faraxsan tahay
I think the main reason was me	Waxaan u malaynayaa in sababta ugu weyn ay aniga ahayd
It was known.	Waa la ogaa.
I knew how much you wanted something similar	Waan ogaa inta aad rabto wax la mid ah
I know everything there is to know about you	Waan ogahay wax walba oo jira inaan adiga kugu ogaado
I thought it was weird.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I did not come here to see you	Halkan uma iman inaan ku arko
I want to tell you everything	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba kuu sheego
Everything really.	Wax walba runtii.
He said he knew and would do it.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu garanayo oo uu samayn doono.
He wants that.	Taas ayuu rabaa.
That was too early.	Taasi waxay ahayd goor hore.
Most likely, she will be there.	Waxay u badan tahay, inay halkaas joogi doonto.
I thought he wanted to know	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu rabo inuu ogaado
There must be something.	Waa inay wax jiraan.
I was there for that.	Waxa aan joogay taas.
But I often do not.	Laakiin inta badan ma sameeyo.
There is no such thing	Wax la mid ah ma jiro
I need that.	Waxaan u baahanahay taas.
I will be ready.	waan diyaar noqon doonaa.
He had no idea what he would get.	Wax fikrad ah kama uu haysan waxa uu heli doono.
I have to do what he says	Waa inaan sameeyaa waxa uu yidhi
He loves you.	Wuu ku jecel yahay.
It doesn't look too big.	Uma eka mid aad u weyn.
It stays.	Way iska joogto.
Not so great.	Ma ahan wax sidaas u weyn.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I could not believe it.	Waan rumaysan waayay.
Then he told us.	Ka dib ayuu noo sheegay.
But he still came.	Laakiin weli wuu yimid.
I think that is very good	Waxaan filayaa in taasi aad u fiican tahay
I thought I might have more friends	Waxaan u maleeyay in laga yaabaa inaan ka badan saaxiibo
No one has come yet.	Weli cidna uma iman.
I know that is hard for you	Waan ogahay inay taasi kugu adag tahay
I have no idea she refused	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay diiday
It must have been very difficult for him.	Waa inay aad ugu adag tahay isaga.
But now it's you.	Laakiin hadda waa adiga.
Give it a chance.	Fursad sii.
She said she could not.	Waxay tidhi ma awoodin.
I haven't been one for a while.	In muddo ah maan mid noqon.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
I wonder how he got into it.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida uu u galay.
But they are.	Laakiin waxay yihiin.
I felt this way	Waxaan ka dareemay arrintan
It was here.	Waxay ahayd halkan.
I know what would happen	Waan ogahay waxa dhici lahaa
But that is not a big problem.	Laakiin taasi dhibaato weyn maaha.
I know you can't help it	Waan ogahay inaadan caawin karin
I told you this was a good idea	Waxaan kuu sheegay in tani ay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan
I can see you want to say something	Waxaan arki karaa inaad rabto inaad wax sheegto
That is not what I will do.	Taasi maaha waxa aan sameyn doono.
All is well.	Dhammaan waa fiican yihiin.
Someone else, someone else.	Qof kale, qof kale.
I just need to know what you said.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxaad tidhi.
Great place to stay	Meel aad u fiican oo la joogo
They do as they are told.	Waxay sameeyaan sida lagu yidhi.
I doubt they will come back again	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay mar kale soo noqon doonaan
I think he even sees next	Waxaan u maleynayaa xitaa inuu arko soo socda
I got it three years later	Saddex sano ka dib ayaan helay
I look forward to seeing you all there!	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku wada arko halkaas!
I still do not understand	Wali maan fahmin
Beautiful, but amazing.	Qurux badan, laakiin yaab leh.
I had nothing but time	Ma haysan wax aan waqti ahayn
Do not say anything to anyone, do not say anything to anyone.	Qofna waxba ha odhan, hal qofna ha odhan.
I want to see you again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale arko
It will be a while.	Waxay noqon doontaa muddo.
I knew what was coming	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda
And smart and tough.	Iyo caqli badan oo adag.
This is very common.	Tani aad bay u badan tahay.
I need a little more	Waxaan u baahanahay wax yar
A lot goes with you.	Wax badan ayaa kula socda.
I looked good	Si fiican ayaan u eegay
I have no problem with this	Wax dhib ah igama helin tan
Who, what and why.	Yaa, maxay iyo sababta.
I have heard a lot about you	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay
It is something you do not want to do.	Waa wax aadan rabin inaad sameyso.
It is so beautiful	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay
Only very, very difficult.	Kaliya aad iyo aad u adag.
There is one.	Mid baa jira.
I will not be here to see	Halkan uma joogi doono inaan arko
This is likely to happen shortly.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inay dhici doonto wax yar.
I really felt that way	Runtii taas ayaan dareemay
I do not do much.	Wax badan ma sameeyo.
I thought they were what everyone wanted	Waxaan u maleeyay inay yihiin waxa qof kastaa rabo
It was not what he wanted.	Ma ahayn waxa uu rabay.
I did not want him to know	Maan rabin inuu ogaado
I have to get it first	Waa inaan marka hore helo
Not bad.	Si xun.
Good for everyone.	U fiican qof walba.
And another.	Iyo mid kale.
I did not want to go home	Ma rabin inaan guriga aado
But he looked up.	Laakiin wuu eegay.
Can you help with this please.	Ma ka caawin kartaa arrintan fadlan.
A man of money.	Nin lacag ah.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
It was lucky.	Waxay ahayd nasiib.
I can no longer go there	Mar dambe ma aadi karo halkaas
I can't find it to do this.	Ma heli karo si aan tan ku sameeyo.
I just want to help you anyway	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo si kasta
I wanted to know more about you	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan kaa ogaado
I miss you	Waan kaa xiiso qabaa
This she did, but to no avail.	Tani way samaysay, laakiin kuma guulaysan.
I can't give it to him	Ma siin karo isaga
Not everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa ma garanayo taas.
I have heard a lot about you.    	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay.    
I was not him	Ma aanan ahayn isaga
A little.	Wax yar.
That should be sufficient enough for you.	Taas ayaa ku filan tan.
I have to do that.	Waa inaan taas sameeyaa.
I can't help myself	Ma is caawin karo
I want to be here with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan kula joogo
I tried.	Waan isku dayay.
I did not want to see him again	Ma rabin inaan mar kale arko
It looks like recently.	Waxay u egtahay dhawaan.
I wonder if the same is still true here	Waxaan la yaabanahay in taas la mid ah ay weli run tahay halkan
I need you to be here for me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkan ii joogto
That is how we can help.	Taasi waa sida aan ku caawin karno.
Small, not big	Wax yar, wax weyn maaha
I want more than ever	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan sidii hore
I can't believe it was him	Ma rumaysan karo inuu isaga ahaa
I felt wanted, needed	Waxaan dareemay in la rabo, loo baahan yahay
I will not take it anymore.	Mar dambe ma qaadan doono.
I just want to be able to eat	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan awoodo inaan wax cuno
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
It is not money.	Maaha lacag.
I need to know something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax ogaado
I tried to help, but.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo, laakiin.
I think something will happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax dhici doonaan.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I do not want to see it again.	Ma doonayo inaan mar dambe arko.
It is not interesting to us.	Ma aha mid xiiso noo leh.
A little taken from there	In yar oo halkaas laga qaaday
He said no.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay jirin.
From place to place.	Meel ilaa meel kale.
Don't tell them.	Ha u sheegin.
He did not leave	Ma bixin
No one has seen it yet.	Weli cidna ma arag.
I am an unfortunate person	Waxaan ahay qof aan nasiib lahayn
One of us has to go.	Mid naga mid ah waa inuu tago.
He wanted to come home.	Wuxuu rabay inuu guriga yimaado.
He had many friends.	Waxa uu lahaa saaxiibo badan.
Here you can see as much as you want.	Halkan waxaad ku arki kartaa ilaa inta aad rabto.
I will go tomorrow	Berri ayaan tagi doonaa
But it was not as bad as it used to be.	Laakiin ma ahayn sida ay u xun tahay.
It has everything you could need.	Waxay leedahay wax kasta oo aad u baahan karto.
.	.
I hope you will do so again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto mar kale
Everything is correct.	Wax walba waa sax.
I'm really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
And to come back.	Iyo inuu soo noqdo.
I need to go to work	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqada tago
I wish it was not over	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aanay dhammaan
They did not see him coming.	Ma ay arag isaga oo u soo socda.
I don't know anyone like that.	Ma garanayo qof sidaas oo kale ah.
I heard you	Waan kaa maqlay
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
That would do.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd.
It's me and you.	Waa aniga iyo adiga.
She always had something to say.	Had iyo jeer waxay lahayd wax ay sheegto.
I haven't seen a single car here	Hal baabuur kuma arag halkan oo dhan
I need to go home now, not anymore	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan guriga aado hadda, ma aha mar dambe
I'm sure everything you do will be great	Waxaan hubaa wax kasta oo aad sameyso inay noqon doonto mid weyn
This is true everywhere.	Tani waa run meel kasta.
I would go	waan tagi lahaa
I think he is still alive	Waxaan filayaa inuu weli nool yahay
Otherwise, it is not.	Haddii kale, ma aha.
She was the right person	Waxay ahayd qof sax ah
I want to be with you always	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo mar walba
I am really happy to be here	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo
I can tell you it's bad	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa in ay xun tahay
But she would, she would come up with.	Laakiin way lahayd, way la soo bixi lahayd.
You are one of them.	Waxaad ka mid tahay.
Not too small.	Ma aha mid aad u yar.
And she did.	Oo runtii way samaysay.
I just want to stay here	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan sii joogo
That was what he wanted.	Taasi waxay ahayd wixii uu rabay.
Today was busy.	Maanta waxay ahayd mashquul.
I thought you wouldn’t do it	Waxaan u maleeyay inaadan yeeli doonin
That is enough for me.	Taasi waa igu filan tahay aniga.
I see nothing else.	Wax kale ma arko.
I have not been able to find out why this is still the case.	Ma awoodin inaan ogaado sababta ay taasi weli tahay.
I love being wanted.	Waxaan jeclahay in la i doonayo.
you lied to me.	been baad ii sheegtay.
And I still don't like it.	Oo weli ma jecli.
You and I did nothing	Adiga iyo aniga waxba maan samayn
Can anyone help me please.	Qofna ma i caawin karaa fadlan.
Not too big, not too small.	Aad uma weyn, ma yara.
It's hard there.	Way ku adag tahay halkaas.
This is a good thing for me now.	Tani waa wax ii fiican hadda.
I'm not sure of anything else	Wax kale aad uma hubo
Maybe I eat too much	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan aad u cuno
I wanted to tell you something	Waxaan rabay inaan wax kuu sheego
I tried to say something positive	Waxaan isku dayay in aan wax wanaagsan ka sheego
We would do it	Waan samayn lahayn
In fact, she probably did.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay u badan tahay inay samaysay.
Do the work.	Qabo shaqada.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
I did not take anything	Waxba maan qaadan
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
I asked to be done	Waxaan codsaday in la sameeyo
I know this is true	Waan ogahay in tani ay dhab tahay
I think she lied	Waxay ila tahay inay been sheegtay
They did not go.	Ma ay aadi jirin.
He surprised me even more.	Wuu iga sii yaabay.
How beautiful I have to have you here.	Sidee u qurux badan tahay inaan ku haysto halkan.
I was surprised that not everyone was there	Waxaan la yaabay in qof walba uusan joogin
It was an interesting idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad xiiso leh.
And it will be something.	Oo waxay noqon doontaa wax.
She is happy to be with you.	Way ku faraxsan tahay inay la joogto.
Not very good, but right.	Ma aha mid aad u fiican, laakiin sax.
He's gone now.	Hadda ayuu baxay.
I still do not understand	Wali ma fahmin
Not anymore, he said.	Mar dambe maaha, ayuu yidhi.
Something else is true.	Wax kale waa run.
I could not do anything	Waxba kuma aan samayn karin
She really couldn't.	Runtii way awoodi wayday.
Good	Fiican
I will always be good to you	Mar walba waan kuu fiicnaan doonaa
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
I was surprised we could still be friends	Waxaan la yaabay in aan wali saaxiibo noqon karno
He already knew.	Hore ayuu u ogaa.
If he were.	Haddii uu ahaa.
I tried	waan isku dayay
Both are smart to do so	Labaduba way caqli badan yihiin inay sidaas sameeyaan
I wanted to know what it was	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxay ahayd
I liked it most	Waan ka helay inta badan
If none are available, none are available.	Haddii aysan jirin mid la heli karo, ma jiro mid la heli karo.
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
It can be any.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid kasta.
This took me a lot of time.	Tani waxay iga qaaday waqti badan.
I think I will stay now	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan hadda sii joogi doono
He saw an opportunity.	Wuxuu arkay fursad.
But obviously she was smart.	Laakiin sida cad waxay ahayd mid caqli badan.
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
I think he is very happy now	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu aad ugu faraxsan yahay hadda
I am somewhere else	meel kale ayaan joogaa
I can take a lot more	Waxaan qaadan karaa wax badan oo dhan
I was very surprised.	Aad ayaan u yaabay.
I know this is really hard for you	Waan ogahay in tani ay runtii kugu adag tahay
In fact, it wasn’t too bad.	Dhab ahaantii, ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
I do not know what.	Ma garanayo waxa.
Now you are one of us.	Hadda waxaad tahay mid naga mid ah.
But they did not stop.	Laakiin ma ay joojin.
He tried to help.	Waxa uu isku dayay in uu caawiyo.
It was a great idea	Waxay ahayd fikrad fiican
But he would like it if he wanted to.	Laakiin wuu jeclaan lahaa haddii uu rabo.
I enjoy the hard work	Waan ku faraxsanahay shaqada adag
She is very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
No more.	Mar dambe ma jiro.
Now, that will do.	Hadda, taasi way sameyn doontaa.
It will help you.	Way ku caawin doontaa.
I can give you what you want	Waxaan ku siin karaa waxaad rabto
I really like it	Runtii aad ayaan u jeclahay
I wondered how that could be	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay taasi noqon karto
I know you have nothing to do with this	Waan ogahay inaadan wax shaqo ah ku lahayn arrintan
I want to know what happened.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay.
It is not a lie.	Been ma aha.
I decided to keep it	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sii hayo
What he did to me I liked	Waxa uu igu sameeyay waan ka helay
I could not do anything about that	Taas waxba waan ka qaban waayay
I know you like it too	Waan ogahay in aad sidoo kale jeceshahay
This was home once.	Tani waxay ahayd guriga mar.
I think it would be a big deal.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan lahayd wax weyn oo weyn.
I think you know	Waxay ila tahay inaad ogaatay
But nothing else, that's right.	Laakiin wax kale ma aha, waa sax.
I need to talk to you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida uu yahay.
I could not stay here again	Halkan mar dambe ma joogi karin
Something no one really can say.	Wax aan qofna runtii sheegi karin.
I can't go back now	Hadda dib uma noqon karo
Let me see if you are right.	Aan arko haddii aad sax tahay.
Really, really good work.	Runtii, runtii shaqo fiican.
In fact, they are really good.	Dhab ahaantii, runtii way fiican yihiin.
And there must be things there.	Oo waa in ay jiraan waxyaabo halkaas.
He had to do this.	Waxay ahayd inuu tan sameeyo.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Everyone wants something.	Qof walba wax buu rabaa.
We will take any time you can give us.	Waxaan qaadan doonaa wakhti kasta oo aad na siin karto.
I will not tell you what you did	U sheegi maayo waxaad samaysay
Not much could be done.	Ma aha in wax badan la qaban lahaa.
Elsewhere not so.	Meel kale oo aan sidaas ahayn.
There was always a car.	Had iyo jeer waxaa jiray baabuur.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
He's better, you know.	Wuu ka fiican yahay, waad ogtahay.
I did not know what was going on	Maan garanayn waxa socda
I had to be.	Waxay ahayd inaan noqdo.
But there was still much to be done.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax badan oo weli la samayn lahaa.
They need that.	Waxay u baahan yihiin taas.
I did well	si fiican ayaan sameeyay
I got no money	Wax lacag ah ma helin
I am surprised.	Waa ila yaab.
I can't help him now	Hadda ma caawin karo isaga
I hope to see you again, soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko, maalin dhow
She told me she still loved him.	Waxay ii sheegtay inay wali jeceshahay isaga.
Very beautiful	Mid aad u qurux badan
No one else will	Mid kale ma jeclaan doono
For me, it was a busy time.	Aniga, waxay ii ahayd wakhti mashquul badan.
One lie is enough.	Hal been ayaa ku filan.
I wonder if she even knows that.	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay xitaa taas ogtahay.
I didn't think it was that bad	Uma malaynayn inay sidaas u xun tahay
But we will allow that.	Laakiin taasi waanu ogolaan doonaa.
I thought they included a lot as well	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay wax badan ku jiraan sidoo kale
They will not.	Ma yeeli doonaan.
I have no idea what happened	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa dhacay
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
But it may not be.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
It happened quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u dhacay.
I want him to leave	Waxaan rabaa inuu baxo
That can be time consuming	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa wakhti
I said nothing	Waxba uma sheegin
Now I'm back here.	Hadda halkan ayaan ku soo noqday.
I saw something similar	Waxaan arkay wax la mid ah
I went to pick it up	Waxaan u baxay inaan ka soo qaado
I heard little	Wax yar baan maqlay
We need you at all times	Waxaan kuu baahanahay wakhti kasta
At best.	Sida ugu fiican.
It's the same, maybe.	Waa isku mid, malaha.
Now? 	Hadda?
I wondered what else he knew	Maxaa kale oo uu garanayaa ayaan is waydiiyay
This is worse than anything.	Tani wax walba way ka xun tahay.
What do you think.	Maxay kula tahay.
They love it here	Way jecel yihiin halkan
I think you can say that	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas odhan karto
That is what I will get.	Taasi waa waxa aan heli doono.
Give it a little more.	Wax yar ka sii.
To see him, he thought.	Si uu u arko, ayuu u maleeyay.
I would like to help you a lot	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan aad u caawiyo
This is another great opportunity for him.	Tani waa fursad kale oo weyn isaga.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
I had to buy it.	Waxay ahayd inaan iibsado.
It was long enough.	Waxay ahayd muddo dheer oo ku filan.
I'm really happy	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
He seemed approachable, tough.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid loo soo dhawaan karo, adag.
I just didn’t want to talk about that	Kaliya ma rabin inaan ka hadlo taas
Everyone has one.	Qof kastaa mid buu leeyahay.
I know that is not the case	Waan ogahay in taasi aysan ahayn
I really did not want to go	Runtii ma rabin inaan tago
He looked at me without speaking.	Isaga oo aan hadlin ayuu i eegay.
This is unacceptable.	Tani waa wax aan la qaadan karin.
I really know how it is	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa sida ay taasi tahay
I saw it all, but I was not here	Dhammaan waan arkay, laakiin halkan ma joogin
I was not ready for this	Anigu diyaar uma ahayn tan
I think that is something else	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax kale
I did not know this before.	Hore uma aan ogayn arrintan.
is correct	waa sax
I could not let him go	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu iska baxo
That was tough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
I can no longer talk about this	Hadda ka dib kama hadli karo arrintan
Let me tell you.	Aan kuu sheego.
Only if we are lucky, that is.	Kaliya haddii aan nasiib badan nahay, taasi waa.
It will be, too.	Waxay noqon doontaa, sidoo kale.
I was well impressed	Si fiican ayaan ula dhacay
you are right	sax baad tahay
Lots of them.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah.
I did not want to be seen	Ma rabin in la arko
He must have come to tell them something.	Waa inuu u yimid inuu wax u sheego.
I will give that	Taas ayaan siin doonaa
I had to find something else	Waxay ahayd inaan wax kale helo
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh .
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
Now everyone owns it.	Hadda qof walba ayaa iska lahaa.
He told her.	Wuu u sheegay.
Nothing else was said.	Wax kale oo la yidhi ma jirin.
I want to tell it once and for all	Waxaan rabaa inaan u sheego mar iyo dhammaan
Something else was tried.	Wax kale ayaa la isku dayay.
There is so much to say.	Wax badan oo la sheegi karo ayaa jira.
And you know she does.	Oo waad ogtahay inay samaynayso.
I really didn’t want to.	Dhab ahaantii ma aanan rabin.
I think that is it	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay
The best.	Waxa ugu wanaagsan.
He still has it so far.	Weli wuu hayaa ilaa hadda.
I did nothing else	Wax kale maan samayn
Let me talk to him.	Aan la hadlo isaga.
I think it could be.	Waxaan filayaa inuu noqon karo.
In fact, it has.	Dhab ahaantii, waxa ay leedahay.
I don't see people every day.	Dadka ma arko maalin kasta.
She told him.	Way u sheegtay.
I have a hard time eating	Waxaa igu adag inaan wax cuno
I think this is a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay wax wanaagsan.
You can tell me why you did it.	Waxaad ii sheegi kartaa sababta aad u samaysay.
No matter where you go.	Dhib ma leh meesha aad aadi doonto.
But that is.	Laakiin taasi waa.
It may not be a good idea after all.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn fikrad wanaagsan ka dib oo dhan.
And see this.	Oo tan arag.
But they did not take it.	Laakiin ma ay qaadan.
But it is more than that.	Laakiin way ka badan tahay.
A few times in fact.	Dhowr jeer dhab ahaantii.
I told her she was beautiful	Waxaan u sheegay inay qurux badan tahay
She needs someone.	Waxay u baahan tahay qof.
That would be it.	Taasi way ahaan lahayd.
No work.	Shaqada malaha.
I can't have anything like that	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma haysan karo
Right? 	Sax?
Not sure why	Ma hubo sababta
They love me.	Way i jecel yihiin.
I want to know more about it	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado
He says.	Waxa uu leeyahay.
Have a good time.	Waqti fiican qaado.
I would love to have a day with you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan maalin kula joogo
He left nothing.	Waxba wuu ka tagay.
I hope to go there one day.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaas aado maalin.
There is nothing surprising.	Ma jiraan wax la yaab leh.
I will not say it again.	Mar dambe ma odhan doono.
The reason was.	Sababta ayaa ahayd.
No one.	Cidna maaha.
Here was an opportunity.	Halkan waxay ahayd fursad.
I felt very impressed	Waxa aan dareemay in aan aad ula dhacay
I knew they would not help me	Waan ogaa inaysan i caawin doonin
Now I do not have time to do this	Hadda ma hayo wakhti aan ku sameeyo tan
I dont understand.	Maan fahmin.
You are good to people.	Waxaad ku fiican tahay dadka.
But there was no problem.	Laakiin dhib ma jirin.
But that’s just me.	Laakiin taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
I went there regularly	Waxaan halkaas u tagay si joogto ah
I could not take more	Ma qaadan karin in ka badan
I think so.	Waxaan filayaa sidaas.
I was very impressed.	Aad ayaan ula dhacay.
Don't tell me.	Ha ii sheegin.
I tried to find out more	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax badan ka ogaado
She said something about it.	Wax bay ka tidhi.
I don't think anyone really knows.	U malayn maayo in qofna runtii garanayo.
One bad one.	Mid xun.
And it's not a bad thing.	Oo wax xun maaha.
It wasn’t too hard to do everything he did.	Ma ahayn mid aad u adag in la sameeyo wax kasta oo uu sameeyay.
It could not be.	Ma ay noqon karin.
I need to do this, always have	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan sameeyo, had iyo jeer haysto
I want to go to work	Waxaan rabaa inaan shaqada aado
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
Several times, maybe	Dhowr jeer, malaha
She is sorry for him.	Way ka xumahay isaga.
Someone else put it down.	Qof kale ayaa meel dhigay.
But they do not.	Laakiin ma sameeyaan.
Someone must, but it will not be him.	Qof waa inuu, laakiin ma noqon doono isaga.
She told him she needed him.	Waxay u sheegtay inay u baahan tahay isaga.
But it was not another.	Laakiin mid kale ma ahayn.
I told her it was good	Waxaan u sheegay inay fiican tahay
That is what it was.	Taasi waa waxa ay ahayd.
I will not dwell on this	Ma sii joogi doono arrintan
He really loves me.	Runtii wuu i jecel yahay.
When everything is too much.	Marka wax walba ay aad u badan yihiin.
I am in it, now.	Waan ku jiraa, hadda.
I never saw him go out.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo baxay.
I heard everything.	Wax walba waan maqlay.
I could not see why this was true.	Ma arki karin sababta ay tani run u tahay.
Something went wrong.	Wax ka baxay.
I did not receive it.	maan helin.
tell me.	ii sheeg.
He must have done it, here he says he did it.	Waa inuu sameeyay, halkan ayuu ku sheegay inuu sameeyay.
Still, nothing is right.	Weli, ma jiraan wax sax ah.
I just heard	Kaliya waxaan maqlay
I'll tell you later.	dib ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa.
I really don't know what will happen.	Runtii ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
I want to talk to you more	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan kula hadlo
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
Who we are is just fine.	Cidda aan nahay waa iska fiican tahay.
Maybe it was too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ahayd wax aad u badan.
I still have no idea who she is.	Wali maan fikrad ka haysan cidda ay tahay.
He should have expected that.	Waxay ahayd inuu taas ka filan karo.
I have to do something to help you	Waa inaan sameeyaa wax aan ku caawiyo
Not so much today.	Maanta aad uma badna.
I want to leave something out	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka tago
It was no problem.	Dhib la'aan bay ahayd.
I don’t know what you do.	Ma garanayo inaad samaynayso.
I thought we could keep you at home.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan guriga kuu haysan karno.
After a while he put it down.	Muddo ka dib wuu dhigay.
I don't want her to lie to me anymore.	Ma rabo inay mar dambe been ii sheegto.
I am not	Ma ihi
I have to do the same.	Waa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyaa.
After work I went home	Shaqada ka dib ayaan aaday guriga
It was something to do.	Waxay ahayd wax la sameeyo.
I think that is all we need.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay tahay waxa kaliya ee aan u baahanahay.
We will do anything, anything you want.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa wax kasta, wax kasta oo aad rabto.
She had no idea what to expect.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan waxa ay filan karto.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
This has been observed for a long time.	Tan muddo dheer ayaa la arkay.
I would like one to say more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in mid wax badan sheego.
I made it home from work.	Waxaan ka dhigay guriga oo ka yimid shaqada.
This is not true.	Runtii tani run maaha.
He lied to me.	Been buu ii sheegay.
I still don't have it.	Wali ma hayo.
It can take a long time	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer
Everywhere and everywhere.	Meel kasta iyo meel kasta.
I know you have to do this	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad tan sameyso
I wondered if it still existed	Waxa aan is waydiiyay in ay wali jirto
I think it is a good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay wax wanaagsan
I knew something good was going to happen	Waxaan ogaa inay wax wanaagsan dhici doonaan
We would definitely be here again.	Waa hubaal inaan halkan mar kale joogi lahayn.
So much so.	Sidaas ayaa badan.
I still have it today	Ilaa maanta waan hayaa
So far, so good.	Ilaa hadda, si fiican.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.
I would definitely take it from that.	Waxaa hubaal ah inaan taas ka soo qaadan lahaa.
You are alone.	Waxaad tahay keligaa.
I told him everything	Wax walba waan u sheegay
She had no close friends.	Ma ay lahayn saaxiibo u dhow.
Great place.	Meel aad u fiican.
I am very happy to be here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo
I doubt it will go away	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay ka bixi doonto
Great thing.	Wax weyn.
That could not be.	Taasi ma ay noqon karin.
She didn't want to tell him why.	Ma ay rabin in ay u sheegto sababta.
I can no longer lie	Been dambe ma qaadan karo
I knew it would be done	Waan ogaa in la samayn doono
Great man.	Nin weyn.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ma uu doonayn in qof la hadlo.
I must be happy to see him	Waa inaan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko isaga
No one wants that.	Qofna taas ma rabo.
But I didn't think he could do it.	Laakiin uma malaynayn inuu samayn karo.
I really wasn’t there	Runtii ma joogin
How bad it is to come here.	Sidee u xun in uu halkan yimaado.
It is and.	Waa iyo iyo.
Don't leave me now.	Ha iga tagin hadda.
I don't know what happened to him now.	Ma garanayo hadda waxa ku dhacay.
Now, this is not true.	Hadda, tani run maaha.
I want to get a job somewhere	Waxaan rabaa inaan shaqo ka helo meel
I just wonder if it is enough	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay haddii ay ku filan tahay
I know they are small.	Waan ogahay inay yar yihiin.
I looked back	Dib baan u eegay
I went back to school today	Waxaan dib ugu noqday dugsiga maanta
I thought you might be	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad noqon karto
This could be just me.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa aniga kaliya.
He looked good.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I need to learn more	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan barto
I want to have a good time today	Waxaan rabaa inaan waqti fiican sameeyo maanta
Maybe that's why.	Malaha taasi waa sababta.
I didn't want to know more about it.	Ma rabin inaan wax badan ka ogaado.
He did not want to talk to anyone, he did not want to talk to anyone.	Ma uu rabin inuu la hadlo, ma uu doonayn inuu qofna la hadlo.
I had friends, but no real friends	Waxaan lahaa saaxiibo, laakiin ma jirin saaxiibo dhab ah
I could not believe what she was telling me now	Waan rumaysan waayay waxay hadda ii sheegtay
He was not really there	Runtii meesha ma joogin
It has never been the same.	Weligay sidii hore oo kale ma noqon.
I found interesting things	Waxaan helay waxyaabo xiiso leh
The only reason, he did not know.	Sababta kaliya, ma uu ogayn.
I think that is it.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay.
This is another.	Tani waa mid kale.
To be told what to do.	In loo sheego waxa la sameeyo.
I am not ready for this.	Anigu tan diyaar uma ihi.
I don't feel anything.	Waxba ma dareemayo.
I just can't get this	Kaliya tan ma heli karo
I am not a bad person	Ma ihi qof xun
I decided to help	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan caawiyo
I would like this one out.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu kan ka baxo.
I have nowhere else to go	Meel kale oo aan aado ma jirto
He became someone else.	Wuxuu noqday qof kale.
But here is why this is not true.	Laakiin halkan waa sababta tani aysan run u ahayn.
I love him so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga
I will not be able to do it	Ma awoodi doono inaan sameeyo
Something put it here	Wax halkan dhigay
I felt a lot afterwards	Wax badan ayaan dareemay ka dib
I think I want to be there	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan rabo inaan halkaas u joogo
I think he really went out	Waxaan filayaa inuu runtii baxay
You would still win.	Weli waad guulaysan lahayd.
Whenever it was.	Mar kasta oo ay ahayd.
I can't talk right now	Ma la hadli karo hadda
And there is more.	Oo wax badan ayaa jira.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
This is good so far.	Tani way fiican tahay ilaa hadda.
I just looked where I saw it	Kaliya waan eegay halkaas oo aan arkay
i love you wherever you are	waan ku jeclahay meel kasta oo aad joogto
This was.	Tani waxay ahayd.
A little maybe, but it is still the same	In yar ayaa laga yaabaa, laakiin weli waa isku mid
I can find someone there tomorrow	Waxaan heli karaa qof halkaas berrito
I had no idea how to get food.	Wax fikrad ah uma haysan sidii aan cunto ku heli lahaa.
I did not get the money to do that	Maan helin lacag si aan taas u sameeyo
One for him, one for me, he said.	Mid isaga ah, mid aniga, ayuu yidhi.
I wanted you to know	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato
She could not leave.	Waa ay bixi wayday.
I do not lie to people.	Dadka been uma sheego.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
And very little.	Oo aad u yar.
Until work.	Ilaa shaqada.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that	In yar oo tan ka mid ah, in yar oo taas ka mid ah
Probably right.	Malaha waa sax.
I think they are very bad	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u xun yihiin
I have another appointment	Ballan kale ayaan leeyahay
You can tell.	Waad sheegi kartaa.
Everything will be fine.	Wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan.
It looks like a lot.	Waxay u egtahay wax badan.
I think he heard a lot	Waxaan filayaa inuu wax badan maqlay
One day he disappeared.	Maalin ayaa la waayay.
Nothing so far.	Wax ilaa hadda ma jiraan.
I still haven't found it.	Wali ma helin.
I can tell you how smart you are	Waxaan sheegi karaa sida aad u caqli badan tahay
You should too.	Waa inaad sidoo kale.
No one knows what will happen.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
I just need to get there	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas ka helo
I just can't help myself	Kaliya ma is caawin karo
They live nearby.	Waxay ku nool yihiin meel u dhow.
I tried to get a little bit for everyone.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan qof walba wax yar u helo.
Let him speak.	Ha hadlo.
That's what a man does.	Taasi waa waxa uu nin sameeyo.
It looks like another one will be out soon.	Waxay u egtahay inaad mid kale dhawaan bixi doonto.
I just want to do it	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in la sameeyo
It would not be right.	Ma ahaan lahayd wax sax ah.
I know very little about this	Wax yar ayaan ka ogahay tan
It would be nice if that was the case.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii ay taasi ahaan lahayd.
I could not tell him.	Waan u sheegi waayay.
This is going to be very bad for me.	Tani waxay ii noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
That was done without my knowledge.	Taas waxa la sameeyay aniga oo aan ogayn.
I don't know how to be.	Ma garanayo sida loo noqdo.
I want to know what it is	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa uu yahay
A little of this	In yar oo tan ah
He was there, that's enough.	Wuu joogay, taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I wish you were there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkaas joogto
I knew it existed but	Waan ogaa inuu jiro laakiin
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
I used to see it sometimes	Mar mar ayaan arki jiray
I could not see anyone	Qofna maan arki karin
That’s how you want it, not you.	Taasi waa sida aad rabto, ma aha.
You know that.	Waad ogtahay in.
I would love to come back again soon	Waxaan jeclahay inaan mar kale soo noqdo mar dhow
I found him.	waan helay isaga.
He was a great man.	Nin weyn buu ahaa.
I can see why you would do that.	Waan arki karaa sababta aad sidaas u samayn lahayd.
But no one knows what will happen.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
Now you know that is not a problem.	Hadda waxaad ogtahay inaysan taasi dhib ku ahayn.
It was not him.	Ma ahayn isaga.
I would be smarter	Waxaan noqon lahaa mid caqli badan
It was very clear and very clear.	Waxay ahayd mid cad oo aad u cad.
I don't have to be.	Ma aha inaan noqdo.
I never left him	Weligay ma aan ka tagin isaga
I think you can really be something	Waxaan filayaa inaad runtii wax noqon karto
I am no longer you	Mar dambe adiga ma ihi
I would like to know what happened	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
I need to leave	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
Anything.	Wax ka mid ah.
But you do not have to.	Laakiin ma aha inaad.
They are so bad.	Aad bay u xun yihiin.
I haven't done it yet.	Hadda maan samayn.
I can come again tonight	Waan iman karaa mar kale caawa
That is good for that.	Taasi way u fiican tahay taas.
I can see you better	Waan ku arki karaa si fiican
She really had no idea.	Runtii wax fikrad ah ma ay lahayn.
No one has been here for a long time.	Qofna halkan ma joogo muddo dheer.
I can't really tell everything and everyone	Runtii kama sheegi karo wax kasta iyo qof kasta
Doing it every day.	Samaynta maalin kasta.
I hope he finds it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu helo.
I don't have it, anymore.	Ma haysto, mar dambe.
I know you did.	Waan ogahay inaad samaysay.
This is not true now	Tani hadda run maaha
He still did not understand.	Weli ma uu fahmin.
I will not go back there	Halkaas dib ugu noqon maayo
You said you would help me.	Waxaad tidhi waad i caawin doontaa.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
I really have nothing to say	Runtii ma hayo wax aan sheego
I know it has been a long time	Waan ogahay inay muddo dheer ahayd
I know I will do it	Waan ogahay inaan sameyn doono
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
Obviously they could not.	Waxaa cad inaysan awoodin.
I decided to do the same	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyo
He has been with her for a long time.	Muddo dheer ayuu la joogay.
Not what you would expect.	Ma aha waxaad filan lahayd.
I don't like to know who she is.	Ma jecli inaan ogaado cidda ay tahay.
I had other things to do.	Waxaan lahaa waxyaabo kale oo aan sameeyo.
I do not believe there is anyone like you	Maan rumaysan in uu jiro qof kula mid ah
She was not here tonight.	Ma ay joogin halkan caawa.
That is amazing.	Taasi waa yaab.
I'm really happy to be home	Runtii waan ku faraxsanahay inaan guriga joogo
I have to say.	Waa inaan leeyahay.
So he went.	Sidaas ayuu aaday.
Maybe more.	Ma laga yaabaa in ka badan.
That would really be something.	Taasi runtii waxay ahaan lahayd wax.
But now he is gone.	Laakiin hadda wuu baxay.
I do not know	Ma garanayo
He found it and returned.	Wuu helay oo soo noqday.
It won't be home, tonight	Guriga ma ahaan doono, caawa
Now I will talk to him.	Hadda waan la hadli doonaa isaga.
I didn't get much help.	Caawin badan ma aanan helin.
I know it can happen to you	Waan ogahay inay kugu dhici karto
I know it is small	Waan ogahay inay tahay mid yar
Now, it really didn’t matter.	Hadda, runtii dhib ma lahayn.
Someone lives there.	Qof baa halkaas ku nool.
Let me do what someone wants me to do	Aan samayn waxa uu qof doonayo in aan sameeyo
There is not much to see, truth be told.	Wax badan oo la arki karo ma jiraan, run la sheego.
I really hope he gets better	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inuu fiicnaan doono
Does anyone know how to do this?	Ma jiraa qof yaqaan sida tan loo sameeyo?.
He could not say.	Wuu sheegi waayay.
I saw him.	waan arkay isaga.
He did not tell anyone	Cidna uma sheegin
A man who had never spoken before came out	Nin aan hore u hadlin ayaa soo baxay
I told him a lot of truth	Run badan ayaan u sheegay
You would love to	Waad jeclaan lahayd
Everyone looked good.	Qof walba si fiican ayuu u muuqday.
I had to see something	Waxay ahayd inaan wax arko
Ready for anything.	Diyaar u ah wax kasta.
What is the new reason?	Maxay tahay sababta cusub?
I wanna leave	waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
But no one was there.	Laakiin qofna ma jirin.
I decided it was.	Waxaan go'aansaday inuu yahay.
He will always be seen as his own.	Had iyo jeer waxaa lagu arki doonaa sida isaga oo kale.
This is exactly what was found.	Tani waa dhab ahaan waxa la helay.
That is constant.	Taasi waa joogto.
I still don't know how he did it.	Wali ma garanayo sida uu u sameeyay.
I will never leave	Weligay ka bixi maayo
I am very sorry about that	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
No problems were found	Wax dhibaato ah lama arag
He told me he had something to tell me.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu hayo wax uu ii sheego.
I went back to the door and left	Albaabka ayaan ku noqday oo ka baxay
It can be a long time.	Waxay noqon kartaa waqti dheer.
It can't happen tomorrow.	Berrito ma dhici karto.
He told me he had it.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu haysto.
I think that's right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay
It was really beautiful.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
He didn’t have the right job.	Ma uusan haysan shaqo sax ah.
I need to do something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax sameeyo
I had to find out what happened and why.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa dhacay iyo sababta.
She can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karto.
I thought you were one of them	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ka mid tahay
Probably true.	Malaha waa run.
That is what you want.	Taasi waa waxa aad rabto.
But I can't find it.	Laakiin ma awoodo inaan helo.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ahayn.
I need to talk to you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
There is nothing surprising about that.	Ma jiraan wax la yaab leh taas.
It was there.	Halkaas bay ahayd.
I told him everything, too	Wax walba waan u sheegay, sidoo kale
I did not believe him.	Maan rumaysan isaga.
I said nothing back	Wax dib uma odhan
I did not know where else to go	Meel kale oo aan aado maan garanayn
I want to go tomorrow	Waxaan rabaa inaan berrito tago
She will get one more chance.	Waxay heli doontaa hal fursad oo kale.
If this is true everywhere, it is more true here.	Haddii ay tani run tahay meel kasta, halkan waa ka run badan tahay.
I didn’t stop to find out.	Maan joojin si aan u ogaado.
I just didn’t know it was so bad.	Kaliya ma aan ogeyn inay sidaas u xun tahay.
you did not come out.	ma aadan soo bixin.
It was the right thing to do.	Waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
But it was before.	Laakiin waxay ahayd ka hor.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I need to talk to him immediately.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan si degdeg ah ula hadlo isaga.
I have never seen him so hard	Weligay ma arag isaga oo si adag
A little more, too.	In yar oo kale, sidoo kale.
you have.	ku leedahay.
Really, I really enjoyed it	Runtii, runtii waan ka helay
I hope you know	Waxaan filayaa inaad ogaato
You have not spoken to me yet.	Wali ima aad hadlin.
Tell them where it will be.	U sheeg meesha ay noqon doonto.
It can be anything.	Wax bay noqon kartaa.
I told him I would not do that	Waxaan u sheegay inaanan sidaas yeeli doonin
Something happened here, something real.	Wax baa halkan ka dhacay, wax run ah.
I tried to tell you	Waxaan isku dayay inaan kuu sheego
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
They may not have time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan haysan waqti.
I have seen it several times	Waxaan arkay dhowr jeer
Same	La mid ah
But she did not have it.	Laakiin ma aysan haysan.
I really haven't got it yet	Runtii wali maan helin
I think it can be true	Waxaan filayaa inay run noqon karto
You can leave, you can leave.	Waad bixi kartaa, waad bixi kartaa.
He had a long time.	Waxa uu lahaa waqti dheer.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
He is not able to find you	Ma awoodo inuu ku helo
since.	tan iyo.
I want to do this for him	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan u sameeyo isaga
There was so much.	Wax badan baa jiray.
I hope it is not.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan ahayn.
But it will not happen.	Laakiin ma dhici doonto.
I did not know what it was	Maan garanayn waxa ay tahay
Everyone will love him.	Qof kastaa wuu jeclaan doonaa isaga.
Now, this is what you want to know.	Hadda, tani waa waxa aad rabto inaad ogaato.
I need it.	waan u baahanahay.
Maybe it was too hard to find.	Malaha wuxuu ahaa mid aad uga adag in la helo.
They still exist today.	Ilaa maanta waa ay jiraan.
I would leave him.	waan uga tagi lahaa isaga.
I can't say much	Wax badan kama sheegi karo
You will see that they are the same.	Waxaad arki doontaa inay isku mid yihiin.
It should be like.	Waa in sida.
I owe everything to him	Wax walba waan ku leeyahay isaga
I'm glad to talk to you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan kala hadlo.
It just needs no problem.	Kaliya waxay u baahan tahay dhib malaha.
There is something wrong with it.	Wax baa ka jira.
What else is there I wonder.	Maxaa kale oo jira ayaan la yaabanahay.
I was so much worse	Waxaan ahaa wax aad uga xun
I went back	Dib ayaan uga sii noqday
I am in a terrible crisis	Waxaan ku jiraa dhibaato aad u xun
I really need it	aad ayaan ugu baahanahay
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
I am always here for you	Mar walba halkaan ayaan kuu joogaa
I can no longer speak	Hadda ka dib ma hadli karo
Obviously not here.	Sida iska cad halkan maaha.
I found it there	Waan ka helay halkaas
I am very sorry for him	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga
And for a long time.	Iyo muddo dheer.
I had no idea you would even see it	Maan lahayn wax fikrad ah oo aad xitaa arki lahayd
I am very sorry for him	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga
Tried to know him.	Isku dayay inuu ogaado isaga.
It is the same for you.	Waa isku mid adiga.
It's really great.	Runtii aad bay u weyn tahay.
I have a lot.	Wax badan baan leeyahay.
I really don't understand.	Runtii ma fahmin.
He can do anything	Wax walba wuu samayn karaa
I think he would like a friend	Waxaan filayaa inuu jeclaan lahaa saaxiib
There just isn’t much time.	Kaliya ma jiro waqti badan.
But it may be true.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay run tahay.
As it should be.	Sidii ay ahaan lahayd.
It was me there.	Waxay ahayd aniga halkaas.
Absolutely no one.	Dhab ahaantii qofna ma jiro.
He wanted to know.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado.
I need it now.	Waxaan u baahanahay hadda.
I have to do something	Waa inaan wax sameeyay
I looked, no one was there	Waan eegay, qofna meesha ma joogin
I could not leave immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan uga bixi waayay
He never wants anything else.	Waligiis wax kale ma rabo.
That would be something if you had the time.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax haddii aad waqti heli lahayd.
Each of us was given one chance to return.	Mid walba waxa nala siiyay hal fursad oo uu ku noqon karo.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
No one comes up with this.	Qofna kama soo baxo tan.
I just didn’t have time	Kaliya ma helin waqti
We would not do otherwise	Si kale ma yeeli lahayn
I will tell him.	isaga ayaan u sheegi doonaa.
I am really sorry for what happened	Runtii aad ayaan uga xumahay wixii dhacay
It is later there.	Waa markii dambe halkaas.
I want to do better things	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo ka wanaagsan
I knew what I needed	Waan ogaa waxa aan u baahanahay
This is a terrible thing already.	Tani waa wax aad u xun mar hore.
so I left	sidaas ayaan uga tagay
Otherwise, fine.	Haddii kale, si fiican.
But it is still done.	Laakiin weli waa la sameeyay.
I really couldn’t help it.	Runtii ma caawin karin.
You can always find another job.	Had iyo jeer waxaad heli kartaa shaqo kale.
But it is difficult.	Laakiin way adag tahay.
Not much.	Ma badna.
Really nice.	Runtii aad u fiican.
I knew that was true	Waan ogaa in taasi run tahay
I really was, but it looked good.	Runtii waan ahaa, laakiin wuxuu u muuqday mid fiican.
I always do	Mar walba waan sameeyaa
I do not know how much	Ma garanayo ilaa inta
It was really hard.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
It was for me.	Waxay ii ahayd aniga.
I think it will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma samayn doono
I did not want to talk to him	Ma aanan rabin inaan la hadlo
I was told something else	Wax kale ayaa la ii sheegay
Obviously there is a lot to know about this.	Sida cad waxaa jira wax badan oo arrintan laga ogaado.
That is hard to find.	Taasi waa ay adag tahay in la helo.
You really can't win.	Runtii ma guulaysan kartid.
I have no problem finding it	Wax dhib ah kama qabo inaan helo
Not one person.	Hal qof maaha.
I knew nothing about him	Waxba kama garanayn isaga
They will take a long time.	Waxay ku qaadan doonaan waqti dheer.
I did not want that	Taas maan rabin
You had a great time.	Waxaad samaysay waqti aad u fiican.
I felt it all	Aniga oo dhan waan dareemay
I have this	Tan waan hayaa
I saw nothing else.	Wax kale maan arag.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
Most are better.	Inta badan ayaa ka fiican.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda waa taas.
That they are not ready.	In aanay diyaar u ahayn.
I am very sorry at work	Aad ayaan ugu xumahay meesha shaqada
I thought it was right to talk	Waxaan u qaatay inay sax tahay in la hadlo
I have a job	waxaan leeyahay shaqo
I would really like that	Aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa taas
I haven't had it in a while	In muddo ah maan haysan
Even if they don’t know you do it.	Xitaa haddii aysan ku garanayn inaad sameyso.
I love who you are now	Waan jeclahay qofka aad hadda tahay
It is the only way to stop this.	Waa sida kaliya ee tan lagu joojin karo.
I had no money for food.	Wax lacag ah cunto uma haysan.
At first I was not a friend	Marka hore saaxiib lama aan noqon
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
No one would fall for it.	Qofna wuu ku dhici lahaa.
I found it difficult and interesting.	Waxaan ka helay mid adag oo xiiso leh.
I need to know who did this	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado cidda tan samaysay
At any time.	Goor kasta.
I have to see exactly what they contain	Waa inaan si sax ah u arko waxa ay ku jiraan
I do not like him less.	Ma jecli isaga in ka yar.
He is in it.	Wuu ku jiraa.
Not discussed	Lama wada hadlin
I'm not sure if it's true or not.	Ma hubo inay dhab tahay iyo in kale.
I really did not want to leave the place	Runtii ma rabin inaan ka tago meesha
I think I will go.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan tagi doono.
One bigger.	Mid ka weyn.
I had no choice but to tell him what had happened	Maan haysan wax kale oo aan ahayn inaan u sheego waxa dhacay
In the present.	In la joogo.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
Maybe you can help me talk about it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad iga caawin karto inaan ka hadlo.
She would do it.	Way yeeli lahayd.
I wish she was with you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay kula joogto
I hope someone finds it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu qof helo
How good that is !.	Sidee u fiican taasi!.
I know there is more.	Waan ogahay inay jiraan wax ka badan.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
It's best to leave it at that.	Waxa ugu fiican in laga tago, hadda.
When it is good it is good.	Marka ay wanaagsan tahay way wanaagsan tahay.
We need more of this.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo tan ah.
I knew it would happen	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto
I could not do that	Taas ma aan samayn karin
I went in and took a good look	Waan galay oo si fiican u eegay
Not me and you.	Ma aha aniga iyo adiga.
I’ve never really found it anywhere else.	Weligay runtii meel kale kama helin.
Everyone told me to take it.	Qof kastaa wuxuu igu yidhi qaado.
I heard what happened to you	Waxaan maqlay waxa kugu dhacay
I would love to be with you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula joogo
But they did not like me.	Laakiin ima jeclayn.
I am with you if you will find me	Waan kuu joogaa haddii aad i heli doonto
not right.	sax maaha.
I can tell there	Waxaan u sheegi karaa halkaas
There is still nothing there.	Weli waxba meesha ma jiraan.
I used to do that from time to time	Taas ayaan samayn jiray mar mar
He probably has no idea what will happen.	Waxay u badan tahay inuusan wax fikrad ah ka lahayn waxa dhici doona.
I just couldn't believe he was doing this	Kaliya ma rumaysan karin inuu tan samaynayo
They are more like people.	Waxay u badan yihiin sida dadka.
We can't be.	Ma noqon karno.
I am smart	caqli baan ahay
I do not know how long he was there	Maan garanayn inta uu halkaas joogay
Obviously not real.	Waxa cad in aanay dhab ahayn.
Everyone had.	Qof kastaa wuu lahaa.
I want you to do the same today.	Waxaan rabaa inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso maanta.
I didn't want to talk to her anymore	Ma rabin inaan la hadlo mar dambe
It could be me.	Waxay noqon kartaa aniga.
I don't know how real it is.	Ma garanayo sida ay u dhab tahay.
She can do anything	Wax walba way sameyn kartaa
You really are.	Runtii waad tahay.
I'm glad you told me	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad ii sheegtay
He knew what he wanted and how he could get it.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu rabo iyo sida uu ku heli karo.
He said a lot.	Wax badan buu yidhi.
This is less complicated than it looks.	Tani way ka dhib yar tahay sida ay u egtahay.
I don't understand how this was done.	Ma fahmin sida tan loo sameeyay.
I wish it was so hard	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay aad u adag tahay
I will not say anything about it	Waxba ka odhan maayo
I do not know for sure	Ma garanayo hubaal
I wonder if they are friends	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay saaxiibo yihiin
I have things to learn, too	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan barto, sidoo kale
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax yaab leh.
I have to leave	waa inaan baxo
You will return.	Waad soo noqon doontaa.
I was surprised by the same thing	Waxaan la yaabay isla wax la mid ah
For him, it was no problem.	Isaga, dhib kuma lahayn.
All the same.	Dhammaan isku mid.
I did nothing	Anigu waxba maan samayn
But not much.	Laakiin ma badna.
But it does not seem interesting.	Laakiin uma eka mid xiiso leh.
This is a good thing to have.	Tani waa wax fiican in la haysto.
I wanted to see everyone happy	Waxaan rabay inaan arko qof walba oo faraxsan
I don't want to keep you.	Ma rabo inaan ku sii hayo.
I did not know what it was	Maan garanayn waxa uu yahay
I don't like that.	Ma jecli taas.
There is no time or place.	Waqti iyo meel ma jiraan.
It is today.	Waa maanta.
You can't expect that, no one can.	Taas ma filan kartid, qofna ma awoodo.
The door left.	Albaabka ayaa ka tagay.
You are really interesting.	Runtii aad baad u xiiso badan tahay.
I want to have another chance.	Waxaan rabaa inaan fursad kale helo.
But it is correct.	Laakiin waa sax.
I went there as well	Halkaas ayaan sidoo kale aaday
How can that happen.	Sidee u dhici kartaa .
There was nothing to take with us.	Ma jirin wax nala qaado.
I really don't think so.	Runtii uma malaynayo.
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad maan helin.
You can't help everyone.	Qof walba ma caawin kartid.
I was surprised by what he saw	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu arkay
I will get it.	waan heli doonaa.
This is what you think and how you really look.	Tani waxay u malaynaysaa iyo sida aad runtii u egtahay.
I had no idea what was in it	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxa ku jira
It certainly felt that way.	Waa hubaal in sidaas la dareemay.
Here and there.	Halkan iyo ka baxay.
He is back now.	Hadda ayuu soo noqday.
It has a lot of good stuff.	Waxay leedahay waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan.
I really don't think he likes it.	Dhab ahaantii uma malaynayo inuusan jeclayn.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
Much, much, much less.	In badan, aad, aad uga yar.
I left there	Halkaas ayaan uga tagay
That was one chance.	Taasi waxay ahayd hal fursad.
I love it here	Waan jeclahay halkan
It is long.	Waa dheer yahay.
He did not say.	Ma uu odhan.
In fact, it looks so good.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I can't believe they are real	Ma rumaysan karo inay dhab yihiin
Something happened to him.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
It felt right.	Waxa la dareemay in ay sax tahay.
I know you are smart.	Waan ogahay inaad caqli badan tahay.
He wanted to do more and see more and become more.	Waxa uu rabay in uu wax badan sameeyo oo uu wax badan arko oo uu noqdo wax badan.
She has a good idea of ​​what is going on.	Waxay leedahay fikrad wanaagsan waxa socda.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
I know this now more than ever	Tani hadda waan ogahay in ka badan sidii hore
But you will come back.	Laakiin waad soo noqon doontaa.
But it was very interesting.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
It looks brand new !.	Waxay u egtahay mid cusub!.
It includes.	Waxaa ka mid ah.
So far he has not seen it.	Ilaa hadda ma uu arag.
He says today.	Waxa uu maanta leeyahay.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
I certainly would not leave.	Hubaal ma aanan bixi doonin.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
He told her the house she would see.	Guriga ay arki doonto ayuu u sheegay.
I can't believe he bought it, either	Ma rumaysan karo inuu iibsaday, sidoo kale
I was surprised it would be again	Waxaan la yaabay inay mar kale noqon doonto
I love him as he is	Waan jeclahay isaga sida uu yahay
Just thought this would be interesting to know.	Kaliya u maleeyay in tani ay noqon doonto mid xiiso leh in la ogaado.
No one can find me here.	Qofna ima heli karo halkan.
In fact, it would help.	Dhab ahaantii, way ku caawin lahayd.
I thought it was done	Waxaan u maleeyay in loo sameeyay
The first is this.	Ka hore waa kan.
I need you to promise me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ii ballan qaado
I love you personally	qof ahaan waan ku jeclahay
I know you are with him really good	Waan ogahay inaad isaga la joogto runtii aad bay u wanaagsan tahay
I once felt that way	Mar sidaas ayaan dareemay
I just didn’t want anyone to know.	Kaliya ma rabin in qofna ogaado.
I really need to see people.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan dadka arko.
There is nothing less.	Wax kale ma jiraan wax ka yar.
It would be nice to know what happened to him	In la ogaado waxa ku dhacay way fiicnaan lahayd
I will not be able to do this.	Ma awoodi doono inaan tan sameeyo.
I look forward to working with you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
Tell them what you want.	U sheeg waxaad rabto.
I was surprised, but.	Waan yaabay, laakiin.
But so far he has arrived.	Laakiin ilaa hadda wuu yimid.
I did not know how to find you	Maan garanayn si aan kuu helo
I really have to go home.	Runtii waa inaan aado guriga.
You can only come here to eat.	Waxaad halkan u iman kartaa oo kaliya inaad wax cunto.
I just need to get out.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
A few things are clear	Waxyaabo yar ayaa iska cad
He needs to do this.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu tan sameeyo.
That was very close.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
This will be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa adag.
I'm happy to have it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan haysto.
No one is sure why.	Qofna ma hubo sababta.
I decided that was enough for me.	Waxaan go'aansaday in taasi igu filan tahay.
I have to get a new one	Waa inaan mid cusub helo
It was what it was.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu ahaa.
I love people.	Waxaan jeclahay dadka.
I am just.	Waxaan ahay kaliya.
I didn't want to, again.	Ma rabin, mar kale.
Here is some money	Waa kan xoogaa lacag ah
I did not know who she was	Maan garanayn cidda ay tahay
It would not be good.	Ma fiicnaan lahayd.
I did not understand what was going on	Maan fahmin waxa socda
I have never seen him	Weligay ma arag isaga
Very good man.	Nin aad u fiican.
Everything she owned was gone.	Wax walba oo ay lahayd ayaa meesha ka baxay.
That being said.	Taas oo la yidhi.
No more problems.	Dhib dambe ma jiraan.
It's like this.	Waa sida tan.
I did not get a chance	Fursad maan helin
I did not have much time	Ma aanan haysan waqti badan
I'm glad you're here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto
But it is great.	Laakiin waa mid weyn.
I would be ready	diyaar baan ahaan lahaa
I need him to do it again	Waxaan u baahanahay inuu mar kale sameeyo
I am not sure.	ma hubo.
I need to go and help	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago oo aan caawiyo
She looks like someone he knows.	Waxay u egtahay qof uu yaqaan.
This could be close.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid dhow.
I want something from you	wax baan kaa rabaa
I have so much for him.	Ayaan aad u weyn ayaan u hayaa isaga.
I suspect he doesn't like us	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inuusan na jeclayn
Everywhere it was.	Meel kasta oo sidaas ahayd.
I was rejected again	Mar kale ayaa la i diiday
Lots of great things you can do	Waxyaabo badan oo dhan oo aad samayn karto
I have done this several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan taas sameeyay
He wanted another.	Mid kale ayuu rabay.
He must.	Waa inuu.
This is so much worse	Tani waa si aad uga sii xun
I will not talk to you	kula hadli maayo
I wanted him to stay.	Waxaan rabay inuu joogo.
I want to be surprised	Waxaan rabaa inaan la yaabo
I think we can do it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan sameyn karno
I will not do that	Taas ma samaynayo
I can see you need the rest	Waxaan arki karaa inaad u baahan tahay inta kale
He does not have to say much.	Ma aha inuu wax badan sheego.
It would be better not to leave me.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaadan iga tagin.
I have something to say	waxaan leeyahay wax aan sheego
They are very lucky.	Aad bay u nasiib badan yihiin.
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
It won't do much today	Maanta wax badan ma yeeli doono
Every day is a new day.	Maalin kasta waa maalin cusub.
He may see it again.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu mar kale arko.
I'm not sure why she refused.	Ma hubo sababta ay u diiday.
I have one appointment	Mid baan ballan leeyahay
Good man.	Nin fiican.
I don't have much to work with here.	Ma haysto wax badan oo aan halkan kala shaqeeyo.
I want to do something else	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax kale
I think it will be good for you	Waxaan filayaa inay kuu fiicnaan doonto
I thought that was weird	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay tahay yaab
There was not enough for any of us.	Ma jirin wax nagu filan oo naga mid ah.
I still owe you a few	Weli dhowr baan kugu leeyahay
I do not want to be here	Ma rabo inaan halkaan joogo
He told me there was no problem.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aanay dhibaato jirin.
I thought this was it	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tani tahay
He and I are friends	Aniga iyo isaga ayaan saaxiibo nahay
That is what you want.	Taas oo ah waxa aad rabto.
You don't need him.	Uma baahnid isaga.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
A great man, but a man	Nin aad u weyn, laakiin nin ah
I don't like it more than you.	Ma jecli in ka badan adiga.
That was hard, hard and real.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag, mid adag oo dhab ah.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto
I want to be surprised	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax la yaab leh ku noqdo
Maybe there was still one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli jiray mid.
how is it ?.	waa sidee?.
I will definitely do it	Runtii waan yeeli doonaa
I can find another job	Waxaan heli karaa shaqo kale
I did not know what had happened to me	Ma garanayn waxa igu soo dhacay
It is similar to more than one.	Waxay la mid tahay in ka badan hal.
You didn't tell me anything.	Waxba ima aadan sheegin.
He was a man of action.	Wuxuu ahaa nin sameeyay.
In a few.	In dhowr .
Not sure, really.	Ma hubo taas, dhab ahaantii.
Not available now.	Hadda lama heli karo.
I can do nothing	waxba ma samayn karo
I don't know what's going on.	Ma garanayo waxa socda.
I just can't help myself.	Kaliya ma is caawin karo.
I left enough.	In ku filan ayaan uga tagay.
I need to know more about it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan ka ogaado.
But she did not think it would happen here.	Laakiin uma ay malaynayn inay halkan ka dhici doonto.
That is not true, but it does not matter.	Taasi run maaha, laakiin dhib ma leh.
I can't even help you	Xitaa kuma caawin karo
I wanted to.	Waxaan rabay.
No one is sure what it will be like.	Qofna ma hubo sida uu noqon doono.
Why he came home.	Sababta uu guriga ugu soo noqday.
He may be somewhere now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hadda meel joogo.
I did not want to be there	Maan rabin inaan jiro
That's what he really likes.	Taasi waa waxa uu runtii jecel yahay.
Maybe a little while ago.	Malaha wax yar ka hor.
I just heard that I was told.	Waxaan maqlay oo kaliya in la ii sheegay.
Everyone was at home.	Qof kastaa wuxuu joogay guriga.
That sounds like a weird idea.	Taasi waxay u egtahay fikrad la yaab leh.
We can't leave, not now.	Ma bixi karno, hadda maaha.
That is not difficult.	Taasi maaha mid adag.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
It was the same every day.	Maalin walba isku mid bay ahayd.
It's like this.	Waa sida tan.
Very happy and alive.	Aad u faraxsan oo nool.
I wanted things in me	Waxaan rabay waxyaabo igu jira
Of course, nothing new.	Runtii, wax cusub ma jiraan.
I am very happy that you are	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad tahay
I can't imagine doing it	Ma malayn karo inaan samaynayo
I am very happy with the latter.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay kan dambe.
I looked hard	Si adag ayaan dib ugu eegay
Same, not the same.	La mid ah, isku mid maaha.
I think it is a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay wax wanaagsan.
I did not want to leave	Maan rabin inaan baxo
I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay.
Maybe she was right.	Malaha run bay sheegtay.
I all came in	Dhammaan waan soo galay
But he could not say.	Laakiin wuu sheegi waayay.
This is really great.	Tani runtii waa mid weyn.
I was very busy	Waxaan ahaa mashquul mashquul
I don't see anything at first	Waxba ma arko marka hore
That is the only thing you can believe right now.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad hadda rumaysan karto.
Beautiful.	Qurux badan.
I want to talk to you a little bit more	Waxaan rabaa inaan xoogaa kale kula hadlo
I wish he could help me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu i caawin karo
I think I will get one	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan heli doono mid
No one else is able to do this.	Qof kale ma awoodo inuu tan sameeyo.
I know what she said is true	Waan ogahay waxa ay tidhi waa run
I will do that later	Taas mar dambe ayaan samayn doonaa
I will not do it now, he said.	Hadda ma yeeli doono, ayuu yidhi.
No one wants it	Qofna ma rabo
What I do.	Waxa aan sameeyo.
I wish I hadn't spoken.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaanan hadlin.
I didn't like him very much.	Aad uma aan jeclayn isaga.
We will not let you do that	Kuma ogolaan doono inaad taas samayso
That should help him get it.	Taasi waa inay ka caawiso inuu helo.
Everyone left.	Qof kastaa wuu baxay.
I started immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan u bilaabay
Made for me.	La ii sameeyay.
She didn't want that.	Ma ay rabin taas.
I may not see you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan ku arag.
I know you won't.	Waan ogahay inaadan yeeli doonin.
But he did, after a problem.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay, dhibaato ka dib.
Other things as well.	Waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
I wanted to get out of there, and do it now.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas ka baxo, oo aan hadda sameeyo.
I knew they weren't ready	Waan ogaa inaysan diyaar u ahayn
I have a man at home who loves me	Waxaan guriga ku leeyahay nin i jecel
I found it there	Waan ka helay halkaas
I can be anyone now	Waxaan noqon karaa qof kasta hadda
And very good.	Oo mid aad u wanaagsan.
I wanted to know if there was anyone else here	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado inuu jiro qof kale halkan
I could not stop	Waan joojin waayay
I tried everything.	Wax walba waan isku dayay.
I did not think this could happen to us.	Uma malaynayn in tani nagu dhici karto.
I heard a lot of good from you	Waxaan kaa maqlay wax badan oo wanaagsan
I became a new person	Waxaan noqday qof cusub
I did really well	Runtii si fiican ayaan u sameeyay
This was nothing new.	Tani ma ahayn wax cusub.
Enough now.	Ku filan hadda.
I didn't really like that	Aad uma jeclayn taas
I haven’t had it in a while.	Ma haysto in muddo ah.
I felt out of place	Waxa aan dareemay in aan meesha joogin
I think it can happen	Waxaan filayaa in ay dhici karto
Nothing to do, nowhere to go.	Wax la sameeyo, meel la aado ma jirto.
That's what he would do.	Waa wixii uu samayn lahaa.
It was and me.	Waxay ahayd iyo aniga.
You do not need that.	Uma baahnid taas.
I always took it	Mar walba waan ku qaadan jiray
I will not do it now.	Hadda ma yeeli doono.
There is nothing surprising there.	Ma jiro wax la yaab leh halkaas.
He looked at the door.	Albaabka ayuu eegay.
He said it was not.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay ahayn.
I don't think you have one.	Ma arko in aad mid ku leedahay.
I know you have one	Waan ogahay inaad mid leedahay
I could not say anything else	Wax kale maan sheegi karin
Everyone is.	Dadka oo dhan waa.
I am the other one.	Anigu waxaan ahay kan kale.

I do not like this	Ma jecli tan
They will come to us.	Way noo iman doonaan.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
he said to himself	ayuu is yidhi
We had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inaan samayno.
I did not know how he felt	Maan garanayn sida uu dareemayo
What a wonderful place.	Waa maxay meel aad u fiican.
Not sure how.	Ma hubo sida .
I do not have to say, but it is	Ma aha inaan sheego, laakiin waa
That's right.	Waa sax.
A little really beautiful	Wax yar oo runtii qurux badan
I did not want you at first	Maan rabin inaad marka hore
It would be seen.	Waa la arki lahaa.
I did not, but only	Ma aanan samayn, laakiin kaliya
Really.	Run ahaantii.
But it does not look like anyone.	Laakiin qofna uma eka.
I think there is not much she can say	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaysan jirin wax badan oo ay ka odhan karto
He did not want to leave.	Ma rabin inuu baxo.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while	Waxa aan rabay in aan keligaa kula joogo muddo
You will find this.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa tan.
I say what needs to be said	Waxaan leeyahay maxaa loo baahan yahay in la sheego

I started with that.	Waxaan ku bilaabay taas.
I can not do what he says	Ma samayn karo wuxuu leeyahay
I will not return.	soo noqon maayo.
She would say what she would say.	Waxay odhan lahayd waxay odhan lahayd.
Here, not so much.	Halkan, aan aad u badan.
But this will not do.	Laakiin tani ma yeeli doonto.
I may be able to help	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan caawiyo
I can tell she wants me to stay	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inay i rabto inaan joogo
I thought there was no way out	Waxaan u maleeyay in aysan jirin meel laga baxo
I don't like school here	Ma jecli dugsiga halkan
I want to help you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
Not that this is a bad thing.	Ma aha in taasi ay tahay wax xun.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Lama garanayo waxa ay tahay.
No man knows what he wants.	Ma nin waxa uu rabo yaqaan.
At first I did not know what to do	Markii hore maan garanayn waxaan ka sameeyo
But today was a good day.	Laakiin maanta waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
I really need to leave	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
Still, it did not help.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, waxba ma ay caawin.
I tried again, still nothing	Mar kale ayaan isku dayay, wali waxba
I will do it tonight	caawa waan samayn doonaa
I hope you have a great day	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad leedahay maalin weyn
I did not know exactly what it was	Ma aan si sax ah u garanayn waxa ay tahay

I thought they would take me seriously	Waxaan u maleeyay inay si dhab ah ii qaadan doonaan

Again and again.	Mar kale iyo mar kale.
I think you need it whenever you can	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad u baahan tahay waqti kasta oo aad heli karto
They will get better.	Way fiicnaan doonaan.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
I will always be there for you	Had iyo jeer waan kuu joogi doonaa adiga
I thought you were happy	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad faraxsan tahay
I just want to help him	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo isaga
You can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban kartid.
This should come as no surprise.	Tani waa in aan la yaab lahayn.
Really, that’s what you are.	Run ahaantii, waa waxa aad tahay.
This would happen.	Tani way dhici lahayd.
You can get it back	Dib ayaad u heli kartaa
I know you are new to this.	Waan ogahay inaad tan ku cusub tahay.
It was a good thing.	Waxay ahayd wax fiican.
I can't see what she will do	Ma arki karo waxa ay qaban doonto
We would love to.	Waan jeclaan lahayn.
This is difficult.	Tani waa adag tahay.
I did nothing	Waxba maan qaban
That there is no way out	In aanay jirin meel laga baxo
How often.	Ilaa inta jeer ee ay.
As it was.	Sidii ay ahayd.
I did not know what to do	Wax aan ka sameeyo maan garanayn
I could not see him again	Mar dambe maan arki karin
I had to find time	Waxay ahayd inaan ku helo wakhti
I am sure there will be more.	Waxaan hubaa in wax badan la heli doono.
I wonder what he wants	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu rabo
That really is it.	Runtii waa taas.
He could not say why.	Sababta ayuu u sheegi waayay.
I was no longer.	Mar dambe maan ahayn.
It will not take long.	Waqti badan kuma qaadan doonto.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
I need more.	Wax badan ayaan u baahanahay.
Maybe I get a bit	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan helo xoogaa
I want everything from you	Wax walba waan kaa rabaa
It may not even exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa sidoo kale inaysan xitaa jirin.
But there is something in it, after all.	Laakiin wax baa ku jira, ka dib oo dhan.
I have not found anything good in it.	Wax wanaagsan oo aan ku hayo maan helin.
It is not difficult to know.	Ma aha mid adag in la ogaado.
I have to leave the room	Waa inaan qolka ka baxo
I just did not know what she wanted	Kaliya maan garanayn waxay rabto
I don't think you will.	Uma maleynayo inaad sameyn doonto.
I wanted to tell you that	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas kuu sheego
If anyone has an idea of ​​what is going on.	Haddii qof uu fikrad ka haysto waxa socda.
I should have known you would not be better	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaadan fiicnaan doonin
I don't know if it existed or not.	Ma garanayo inuu jiray iyo in kale.
But he is still unlucky.	Laakiin weli nasiib ma leh.
Once upon a time.	Mar baa.
Whatever happened, this was beautiful.	Wax kasta oo dhacay, tani waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
I had no idea how I was going to be	Wax fikrad ah kama helin sidii aan ahaan lahaa
He went.	Wuu u tagay.
I did nothing.	waxba maan samayn.
To be.	Si uu ahaa.
I became less than before	Waxaan noqday mid ka yar sidii hore
He is not even here.	Xitaa halkan ma joogo.
I thought I had left	Aniga oo is leh ayaan ka tagay
I heard him very well	Aad baan u maqlay isaga
I will need to do something soon	Waxaan u baahan doonaa inaan wax sameeyo dhawaan
I'm glad he didn't say anything.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuusan waxba odhan.
This should be good.	Tani waa inay wanaagsan tahay.
I can't help it anymore.	Mar dambe kuma caawin karo.
I think it looks beautiful	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay u egtahay qurux
In fact, it is not that difficult.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha inay sidaas u adag tahay.
I would not speak.	ma hadli lahaa.
He did not do that.	Taas ma uu samayn.
He felt.	Wuu dareemay.
What a friend.	Maxaa saaxiib.
I have to know what happened	Waa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
I don’t think I will need it.	U malayn maayo inaan u baahan doono.
I hope you are like that.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas tahay.
Much less than everyone would have expected	In badan oo ka yar qof kasta ayaa filan lahaa
I was very impressed	Aad baan ula dhacay
Not much was said.	Wax badan lama sheegin.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
I was not ready to talk to him	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan la hadlo
It is very, very difficult.	Aad iyo aad bay u adag tahay.
There may be more involved.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay wax badan ku jiraan.
I felt no pain	Wax dhib ah ayaan dareemay
I just don’t know what to do with you.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxaan kugu sameeyo.
There was so much he did not know yet.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo uusan weli ogeyn.
There was nowhere to go	Ma jirin meel la aado
I would really like.	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa.
That doesn't sound like what you want.	Taasi uma eka waxaad rabto.
He was here.	Halkan ayuu u joogay.
But they are very good here.	Laakiin halkan aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I think there is work to be done here	Waxaan filayaa inay halkan shaqo ka jirto
I really need you now	Runtii waan kuu baahanahay hadda
I saw everything	Wax walba waan arkay
For me you are.	Aniga ahaan waxaad tahay.
I doubt anyone will be there	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in qofna uu halkaas joogi doono
It would do a good job of this.	Waxay samayn lahayd shaqo fiican tan.
First he would need food.	Marka hore wuxuu u baahan lahaa cunto.
I think he needs it	Waxaan filayaa inuu u baahan yahay
I will not see you again	Mar dambe ku arki maayo
Really, I really do.	Runtii, runtii waan sameeyaa.
Very bad place	Meel aad u xun
She did it for me.	Way igu samaysay.
They love each other.	Way is jecel yihiin.
Only people who gave.	Kaliya dadka wax siiyay.
I just want to be myself.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo aniga.
I should never have come here, he thought	Ma ahayn inaan weligay halkan iman, ayuu is yidhi
I can't speak tonight	Caawa ma hadli karo
That she knew.	In ay ogaatay.
I can hardly believe it either	Si dhib leh ayaan sidoo kale u rumaysan karaa
If anyone knows.	Haddii qof garanayo.
I always do that, too	Had iyo jeer waan sameeyaa taas, sidoo kale
It's hard, but it's smart.	Waa adag yahay, laakiin waa caqli badan yahay.
I did not know who she was	Maan garanayn cidda ay tahay
It was his favorite.	Waxay ahayd uu jecel yahay.
But he was a happy man.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa nin faraxsan.
I wanted to stay	Waxaan rabay inaan joogo
I never want to do that	Weligay ma doonayo inaan taas sameeyo
But not anymore.	Laakiin mar dambe maaha.
I did not know he would return	Maan ogayn inuu soo noqon doono
More often than not.	In ka badan inta badan.
There is not much chance of what you want.	Ma jirto fursad badan oo ah waxaad rabto.
I'll tell you what	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
I wanted more	Wax ka badan ayaan rabay
I say and I will say, again	Waxaan leeyahay oo aan odhan doonaa, mar kale
I know they are happy	Waan ogahay inay faraxsan yihiin
He looked back.	Dib buu u eegay.
I don't think that's a very good idea.	U malayn maayo in taasi ay tahay fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
He was ready to go.	Wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu tago.
I will not speak tonight.	Caawa ma hadli doono.
It is not too late.	Ma aha goor dambe.
Not many, but few.	Ma badna, laakiin dhowr.
I will speak.	waan hadli doonaa.
It cannot be the same.	Isku mid ma noqon karto.
I wanted it so badly, so, so badly	Aad ayaan u rabay si xun, si, aad u xun
You are right.	Sax baad tahay.
I would like to talk to you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula hadlo
I could not guess why	Ma malayn karin sababta
I would not give it.	Ma siin lahaa.
You know it looks so good.	Waad ogtahay in ay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
But you may be able to help.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ku caawiso.
I know you will never do that again.	Waan ogahay inaadan taas mar dambe samayn doonin.
I think they are very bad	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u xun yihiin
Enough, he seemed to feel, now.	Oo ku filan, wuxuu u muuqday inuu dareemayo, hadda.
This is the same.	Tani waa isku mid.
He could not stay.	Waa uu sii joogi waayay.
It is not a place for us.	Ma aha meel noo.
Again.	Marka kale.
I thought you would be	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad noqon doonto
I knew nothing	Waxba maan garanayn
I need to get out	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka baxo
I really didn’t get much.	Runtii wax badan ma helin.
I know that.	Waan ogahay taas.
I want to know what they are up to	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxay ku jiraan
I know what's coming	Waan ogahay waxa soo socda
I went in to see.	Waxaan u galay inaan arko.
They did not need any work	Wax shaqo ah uma ay baahnayn
But when she told him he was surprised.	Laakiin markii ay u sheegtay ayuu la yaabay.
But it was a day.	Laakiin waxay ahayd maalin.
I like it	waan ka helay
He thought he was surprised.	Yaab buu mooday.
I wish he was here with us	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan nala joogo
He said a lot.	Wax badan buu yidhi.
I am ready to help you with your loved one	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan kaa caawiyo qofka aad jeceshahay
I left a little	Waxa aan tagay wax yar
He was very smart.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u caqli badan.
I really got the job by chance	Run ahaantii waxaan shaqada ku helay nasiib
I can't see anything bad here	Ma arki karo wax xun halkan
But someone did.	Laakiin qof baa sameeyay.
I know it is so.	Waan ogahay inay sidaas tahay.
There is nothing else that can be done.	Wax kale oo la samayn karaa ma jiraan.
I have nothing else to say today	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan sheego maanta
That can be a bit surprising.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa xoogaa la yaab leh.
Don't go there yet.	Weli halkaas ha tagin.
I have no idea what to do with it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa aan ka sameeyo
He certainly did.	Waa hubaal inuu sameeyay.
I know a lot is true	Waan ogahay in wax badan ay run yihiin
I would love to see it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko.
But this can be a problem.	Laakiin tani waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
Can you help with this? 	Ma kaa caawin kartaa tan?
I did not find another	Mid kale maan helin
I will tell you everything you want to know.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto inaad ogaato.
It 's really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
I think there is a lot going on for us.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jiraan waxyaabo badan oo noo socda.
I know what she really has.	Waan garanayaa waxa ay runtii leedahay.
Everyone thought she was smart.	Qof kastaa wuxuu mooday inay caqli badan tahay.
I have things to talk to	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan kula hadlo
That did.	Taasi way samaysay.
I would like to.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aan.
I could not see anything	Waxba maan arki karin
I have an idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad.
And something else as well.	Iyo wax kale sidoo kale.
I can no longer do that	Taas mar dambe ma samayn karo
I know you are a good person	Waan ogahay inaad tahay qof wanaagsan
I need to find myself	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan is helo
I hold as long as she wants	Waan hayaa ilaa inta ay rabto
There is no chance of that.	Ma jirto fursad taas.
They are who they are.	Waa cidda ay yihiin.
I thought it could be	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu noqon karo
If there are, we need more of them.	Haddii ay jiraan, waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo ka mid ah.
It will be much, much better.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax badan, aad uga wanaagsan.
I can't believe he did that	Ma rumaysan karo inuu sidaas sameeyay
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
I knew they were great.	Waan ogaa inay weyn yihiin.
That was quick.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
It never was.	Waligiis sidaas ma ahayn.
She must be older than him.	Waa in ay ka weyn tahay isaga.
More than ever.	Si ka badan sidii hore oo kale.
It's hard.	Waa mid adag.
This is because no one.	Tani waa sababta oo ah ma jiro mid.
A long time ago.	Muddo dheer ka hor.
She refused.	Way diiday.
Maybe I should leave	Malaha waa inaan baxo
Luckily for that.	Nasiib uma badna taas.
It can't hurt you	Waxba kuma yeeli karo
She was a very good person.	Waxay ahayd qof aad u wanaagsan.
Now I have seen this.	Hadda ayaan tan arkay.
I could not see what she did	Ma arki karin waxay samaysay
Everything.	Wax kasta.
I don't want to know more.	Ma rabo inaan sii ogaado.
I will not lie to you	Been kuu sheegi maayo
You can't get everything.	Wax walba ma heli kartid.
I have not yet gone home	Wali guriga maan tagin
This should be enough for us.	Tani waa inay nagu filan tahay.
It would be better not to.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaadan samayn.
This is now.	Tani waa hadda.
The only people who would do that.	Dadka kaliya ee taas samayn lahaa.
I hope you do.	Waxaan filayaa inaad samaynayso.
It's a great idea.	Waa fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
Maybe it's a difficult problem.	Malaha waa dhibaato adag.
I know you are smart	Waan ogahay inaad caqli badan tahay
There is no other way.	Si kale oo loo sameeyo ma jirto.
I didn’t want to do it, really	Ma aanan rabin inaan sameeyo, dhab ahaantii
I already found someone	Waxaan hore u helay qof
We are who we are.	Waxaan nahay waxaan nahay.
So far, no one has come.	Ilaa hadda, qofna ma iman.
Every other place would be better.	Meel kasta oo kale ayaa ka fiicnaan lahayd.
But I do not know what to do.	Laakiin ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
He will leave.	Wuu bixi doonaa.
He said every day.	Wuxuu yiri maalin walba.
I love you for everything.	Wax walba waan ku jeclahay.
We will do it if you want	Waan samayn doonaa haddii aad rabto
I do not know what is in it.	Ma garanayo waxa ku jira.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan tago hadda.
I'll see you at home.	Waxaan ku arki doonaa guriga.
No one today.	Qofna maanta ma jiro.
I just didn't want anyone to see us	Kaliya ma rabin in qof na arko
Like someone took me.	Sidii qof iga qaatay.
I wanted to know everything	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ogaado
I think that is why he has always been in trouble	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay sababta uu mar walba dhib ugu jiray
I am smarter than him.	Aniga ayaa iga caqli badan.
I have no idea how to do it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida aad u sameyso
Everything else is busy.	Wax kasta oo kale waa mashquul.
I know it can happen	Waan ogahay inay dhici karto
This is also unnecessary.	Tani sidoo kale waa mid aan loo baahnayn.
There is no one like him.	Ma jiro qof isaga la mid ah.
I can get a job soon	Waxaan heli karaa shaqo dhawaan
Now we are.	Hadda waxaan nahay.
I know you are	Waan ogahay waxaad tahay
Bad, bad, bad.	Xun, xun, xun.
He wants to learn.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu barto.
He did not get it.	Ma uu helin.
I came back very much.	Aad baan u soo noqday.
It will not hurt me.	Iga yeeli maayo.
I could not find one	Mid baan heli waayay
But it is bigger than that.	Laakiin way ka weyn tahay taas.
No one wants to pick it up.	Qofna ma rabo inuu soo qaado.
I was still the same man	Weli isku nin baan ahaa
I have no money	Lacag ma haysto
I wonder what is in it	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ku jira
Maybe I should work with this	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan tan la shaqeeyo
I have seen and heard many things	Wax badan baan arkay oo maqlay
I will tell him.	waan u sheegi doonaa.
I did not know if that was good or not	Maan garanayn in taasi fiican tahay iyo in kale
But he never does.	Laakiin waligiis ma sameeyo.
I was something new, something interesting	Waxaan ahaa wax cusub, wax xiiso leh
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
But that is how it was.	Laakiin taasi waa sida ay ahayd.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
Very good thing.	Wax aad u fiican.
He was not like you.	Wax adiga oo kale ah ma ahayn.
I know they will love you	Waan ogahay inay ku jeclaan doonaan
I want to be with him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la joogo
I put it there	Halkaas ayaan dhigay
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I did, if you like.	Waan sameeyay, haddii aad jeceshahay.
I have to know it better	Waa inaan si fiican u garanayaa
I want to see something	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax arko
I was everything and everyone.	Waxaan ahaa wax walba iyo qof walba.
You just can't do it.	Kaliya ma sameyn kartid.
I do not lie.	Been ma sheego.
I know him.	waan garanayaa isaga.
This is still uninteresting.	Tani weli waa mid aan xiiso lahayn.
I was there three years ago	Saddex ka hor ayaan halkaas joogay
I know where you are	Meesha waan ku garanayaa
I thought it was the right thing to do	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax sax ah in la sameeyo
I say it is not always true	Waxaan leeyahay mar walba run maaha
It can really be good.	Runtii way fiicnaan kartaa.
How good that is.	Sidee u fiican taas.
I still have no idea who she is	Wali maan fikrad ka haysan cidda ay tahay
I know him better	Si ka fiican ayaan u garanayaa
This was awful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
A man said he knew me	Nin baa yidhi waa i garanayaa
He can do that.	Taas wuu samayn karaa.
I didn't even talk	Xitaa lama aan hadlin
There is that.	Waxaa jira taas.
I could not pay immediately.	Uma bixin karin si degdeg ah.
You need money	Waxaad u baahan tahay lacag
I just wanted to leave.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
It is.	Waa ka.
Here and now.	Halkan iyo hadda.
I did not want to see another day	Ma aanan doonayn inaan arko maalin kale
Everyone would help	Qof walba wuu caawin lahaa
He is not ready	Diyaar uma aha
More than ever.	In ka badan sidii hore.
Now I'm not sure.	Hadda ma hubo.
I'm really sorry about that	Runtii waan ka xumahay taas
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
There is no one better than this.	Ma jiro qof ka wanaagsan kan.
I want to go home, he thought	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga, ayuu is yidhi
You said that now.	Adiga ayaa sidaas u sheegtay hadda.
I think it's bad.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay mid xun.
He was very surprised.	Aad buu ula yaabay.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
That is the least.	Taas ayaa ugu yar.
I am here	halkaan ayaan joogaa
I would leave tomorrow	Berrito waan bixi lahaa
There is nothing more than this.	Ma jiraan wax ka badan tan.
I can't tell him	Uma sheegi karo isaga
I did not want anything from him	Waxba maan rabin isaga
I wondered what they would do	Waxaan la yaabay waxa ay samayn doonaan
Not a little.	Ma aha in yar.
If they are enough, they are enough.	Haddii ay ku filan yihiin, way ku filan yihiin.
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan sax ahayn.
Bad job as well	Shaqo xun sidoo kale
So many things are happening now.	Waxyaabo aad u badan ayaa hadda wax walba ka socda.
Now, this is what is available.	Hadda, tani waa waxa la heli karo.
Now we will get the rest.	Hadda waxaan heli doonaa inta kale.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
Maybe he saw me.	Malaha wuu i arkay.
It is not urgent.	Degdeg uma aha.
I can't be.	Ma noqon karo.
I hope to be back, one day	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan soo noqdo, maalin
I did not find anything interesting.	Ma helin wax xiiso leh.
Obviously you did not help me.	Waxaa cad in aadan iga caawin.
He wanted something from me.	Wax buu iga rabay.
It is also known for its complexity	Waxa kale oo lagu yaqaan dhib badan
I still did not like it	Wali maan jeclayn
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
She can't do it.	Ma yeeli karto isaga.
He has to do a lot.	Wax badan waa inuu sameeyaa.
not you.	ma adiga .
I knew he was holding me	Waan ogaa inuu igu hayo
I could not see	Waan arki waayay
Good at all times.	Wanaagsan wakhti kasta.
I know you will not get that	Waan ogahay inaadan heli doonin taas
I could not see exactly what it was	Si sax ah uma aan arki karin waxa ay tahay
I know there is more	Waan ogahay inay jiraan wax ka badan
And he does the right thing.	Oo wuxuu sameeyaa wax sax ah.
They made no money.	Wax lacag ah ma ay samayn.
I have another idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad kale.
I didn't find anything.	Waxba maan helin.
I have a friend who tried it	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiib isku dayay
I say I did not have time	Waxaan leeyahay waqti ma helin
I wonder what he did there	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu halkaas ka sameeyay
You need to know that.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad taas ogaato.
A trouble-free and good person	Qof aan dhib lahayn oo wanaagsan
Tell me where you are.	Meesha aad joogto ii sheeg.
You will love this.	Waad jeclaan doontaa tan.
I was very impressed with him	Aad ayaan ula dhacay isaga
I didn't say much	Wax badan uma sheegin
I will come and find you.	waan iman doonaa oo ku heli doonaa.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
No one was present.	Qofna meesha kuma jirin.
He looked for a while.	Muddo ayuu eegay.
I need to see everything, to know what happened	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko wax walba, si aan u ogaado waxa dhacay
I knew he would like it	Waan ogaa inuu jeclaan lahaa
How to do it.	Sida loo sameeyo.
Which was probably a good thing.	Taas oo malaha ahayd wax wanaagsan.
I love being with you	Waxaan jeclahay inaan kula joogo
We will do it	Waanu samayn doonaa
I felt like a person	Waxaan dareemay sidii qof
To find you, to help you, if you will allow me.	Si aan ku helo, aan ku caawiyo, haddii aad ii ogolaan doonto.
I just want to be wherever he is	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan joogo meel kasta oo uu joogo
You can't do better.	Wax ka fiican ma samayn kartid.
I haven't been here in a while now	In muddo ah kuma aan joogin hadda
I wanted you to know that.	Waxaan rabay inaad taas ogaato.
Take a problem only once.	Kaliya hal mar dhibaato u qaado.
I told him it wasn't a big deal	Waxaan u sheegay inaysan wax weyn ahayn
I really can't do that for him	Runtii sidaas kuma yeeli karo isaga
I can't afford it	Ma awoodo inaanan awoodin
They are not included	Kuma jiraan
please do not	fadlan ha samayn
There are only things we can do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aan sameyn karno oo kaliya.
I really want to be like him in everything	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ku noqdo isaga oo kale wax walba
You could fall into prison.	Waxaad ku dhici kartaa xabsiga.
I looked but did not see anything	Waan eegay laakiin waxba ma arag
I liked it a lot	Wax badan ayaan ka helay
I just want to do everything	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax walba
You will not tell us that.	Taas ma noo sheegi doontaa.
I have never talked to anyone much	Weligay qofna wax badan lama aan hadlin
I couldn’t imagine doing anything to anyone	Ma malayn karin in aan cidna wax ku sameeyo
Like, really, really great.	Sida, runtii, runtii weyn.
I can tell you want me	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inaad i rabto
It was a few years ago.	Waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
I saw but could not believe it	Waan arkay laakiin ma rumaysan karin
But more will come.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa iman doona.
He saw what happened.	Wuu arkay waxa dhacay.
I'm not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta ay sidaas u tahay.
I'll tell you what	waan kuu sheegi doonaa maxaa
I have to do the same	Waa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyaa
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
Tonight this is one of them	Caawa tani waa mid ka mid ah
I can't believe he is doing this to me	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan igu samaynayo
I know he knows.	Waan ogahay inuu garanayo.
I could not find another place to go	Meel kale oo aan aado maan helin
I have done this before	Tan hore ayaan u sameeyay
Sure, getting divorced would be fun.	Hubaal, inuu kala tago ayaa noqon lahaa mid xiiso leh.
I will always believe this	Mar walba tan waan rumaysan doonaa
I need to know more about this before	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan kaa ogaado tan ka hor
This is because there are none.	Tani waa sababta oo ah ma jiraan.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
First it is correct	Marka hore waa sax
You are too small.	Aad baad u yar tahay.
I think so	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas tahay
I didn't really lie.	Runtii been ma sheegin.
That would be the right thing to do.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
I did not think they would find me soon	Uma malaynayn inay si degdeg ah ii heli doonaan
I tried to talk to him, but he was not ready.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la hadlo, laakiin diyaar uma ahan.
I just need to do more.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay si aan wax badan u sameeyo.
It doesn't look fast.	Wax degdeg ah uma eka.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
This cannot be.	Tani ma noqon karto.
I will not say it again	Mar dambe ma odhan doono
I told him it was not a good idea	Waxa aan u sheegay in aanay fikrad fiican ahayn
I hope you can do the same	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli karto
It was not a big problem.	Dhib weyn ma ahayn.
Even a new friend.	Xitaa saaxiib cusub.
He felt he could do something.	Waxa uu dareemay in uu wax samayn karo.
I need time.	Waxaan u baahanahay waqti.
I can see how she can do that	Waan arki karaa sida ay taasi u samayn karto
No one knows where he lives.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu ku nool yahay.
There was not much time	Ma jirin waqti badan
We will get it if you are.	Waan heli doonaa haddii aad tahay.
Great thing, really	Wax weyn, dhab ahaantii
I will not pay.	Ma bixin doono.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay in ay fiican tahay.
It is truly a beautiful place.	Runtii waa meel qurux badan.
I can't give it to you	kuma siin karo
I have never seen anything better.	Weligay wax ka wanaagsan ma arag.
Again he refused.	Mar kale ayuu diiday.
I hope this is good for you	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay kugu fiican tahay
I did not want a white person.	Ma rabin qof cad.
But that was known.	Laakiin taasi waa la ogaa.
I just know it is true	Kaliya waan ogahay inay run tahay
I could no longer stay	Mar dambe ma joogi karin
I know you don't want to.	Waan ogahay inaadan rabin.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma yeeli doono
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
Often this is not true.	Inta badan taasi run maaha.
He did not take it.	Ma uu qaadan.
She didn't allow it, she didn't allow it.	Way u ogolaan wayday, way u ogolaan wayday.
I felt the same way, let me tell you	Waxaan dareemay sidaas oo kale, aan kuu sheego
I didn't do much at first	Markii hore wax badan maan qaban
A long time ago	Muddo dheer ka hor
Now he could not.	Hadda wuu awoodi waayay.
If you need anything, see us first.	Haddii aad wax u baahan tahay, marka hore na arag.
I need to be here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaan joogo
I just did not know exactly what she was doing	Kaliya maan garanayn si sax ah waxay samaynayso
Much more.	Wax badan ka sii badan.
It has been reported.	Waa la soo sheegay.
I doubt it is.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay tahay.
I started this.	Tan ayaan bilaabay.
Same as.	Mid la mid ah.
I know who she was	Waan ogahay cidda ay ahayd
It was once.	Waxay ahayd hal mar.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas.
Maybe she just wants a job.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay rabto oo kaliya shaqo.
You can only tell.	Kaliya waad sheegi kartaa.
I did not.	Ma aanan.
For a while no one spoke.	In muddo ah qofna ma hadlin.
Now there is something else.	Hadda wax kale ayaa jira.
No one can do it for another person.	Qofna ma samayn karo qof kale.
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
I just know this is what you would do	Kaliya waan ogahay in tani ay tahay waxaad samayn lahayd
That is too much.	Taasi aad bay u badan tahay.
I think that would be great.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd.
I would not do it, otherwise	Ma yeeli lahaa, haddii kale
It was a lie.	Been bay ahayd.
I don't have time.	Waqti ma hayo.
I have not yet gone home	Wali maan tagin guriga
It was, in fact, correct.	Waxay ahayd, dhab ahaantii, sax.
Please, please stay here.	Fadlan, fadlan halkan ha joogo.
I did not know what had happened to me	Ma garanayn waxa igu soo dhacay
He did it often.	Inta badan wuu sameeyay.
It's very good.	Waa wax aad u wanaagsan.
So much more beautiful.	Aad uga qurux badan.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
Now he has an idea.	Hadda wuxuu leeyahay fikrad.
I have to go for something	Waa inaan tago wax
I should have done better	Waxay ahayd inaan si ka wanaagsan sameeyo
I got a chance for him	Isaga ayaan fursad u helay
And so on.	Iyo sidaas.
It was known.	Waa la ogaa.
I came out later	Mar dambe ayaan soo baxay
Now I need to do that.	Hadda waxaan u baahanahay inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I need to go somewhere	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan meel aado
I came in, he has to lie	Waan soo galay, waa inuu been sheego
I think so	Waxaan u malaynayaa in ay sidaas tahay
There is nothing better.	Wax ka fiican ma jiro.
There was enough money for him.	Waxaa jiray lacag ku filan isaga.
I could not see where he was	Meesha uu dhigay ayaan arki waayay
I really don’t want to be that way.	Dhab ahaantii ma doonayo inaan sidaas noqdo.
Beautiful there.	Qurux badan halkaas.
I do not know what happened to you.	Waxa kugu dhacay ma garanayo.
Maybe I know what that is	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ogaado waxa taasi tahay
That's what it looks like.	Taasi waa sida ay u egtahay.
I love you, but not so much.	Waan ku jeclahay, laakiin sidaas maaha.
John was not one of them.	Yooxanaa ka mid ma ahayn.
I hope so, really	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas tahay, runtii
I will say more about this	Wax badan ayaan tan ka sheegi doonaa
I had an idea	Waxaan lahaa fikrad
I want more, more than that	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan, wax ka badan taas
I have never seen anyone go along	Weligay ma arag qof wada socda
It is also the biggest.	Sidoo kale waa tan ugu weyn.
I really don't think she is a man now.	Runtii anigu uma maleynayo inay tahay nin hadda.
But he could not really say.	Laakiin si dhab ah uma uu sheegi karin.
It will probably help.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ku caawin doonto.
We will do it one by one.	Mid mid ayaan sameyn doonaa.
Tell them.	U sheeg.
No one was here.	Halkan qofna ma joogin.
I know that is not true	Waan ogahay taasi run maaha
I am happy to be back home.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku soo noqdo guriga.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
This was for him.	Tani waxay u ahayd mid isaga.
I just can't do it yet	Kaliya ma samayn karo weli
Maybe that is to be expected.	Malaha taasi waa la filayaa.
Now, I will do it.	Hadda, waan sameyn doonaa.
I will not find it otherwise	Si kale uma heli doono
I wanted to do as he asked of me	Waxa aan rabay in aan sameeyo sida uu iga codsaday
I really can't do it	Runtii ma samayn karo
There is always something going on for me	Mar walba wax baa ii socda
There is still time.	Weli wakhti ayaa jira.
I want to work with him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la shaqeeyo isaga
Not all.	Ma dhammaan.
You could have done better !.	Waxaad samayn lahayd si ka wanaagsan!.
Real, real, friend	Dhab ah, dhab ah, saaxiib
I decided to help	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan caawiyo
I can't believe what you just said	Ma rumaysan karo waxaad hadda tidhi
I restarted once	Waxaan dib u bilaabay hal mar
No one knew what to do with it.	Qofna ma garanayn waxa lagu sameeyo.
I have to ask to see.	Waa inaan codsaday inaan arko.
Now he wants to come home.	Hadda wuxuu rabaa inuu guriga yimaado.
This was correct.	Tani waxay ahayd sax.
She would love to help.	Waxay jeclaan lahayd inay caawiso.
I still don't have it.	Wali kuma haysan.
Well, let me tell you.	Fiican, aan kuu sheego.
Nothing else will happen tonight.	Wax kale ma dhici doono caawa.
What he tried.	Muxuu isku dayay.
Absolutely everything that exists.	Dhab ahaantii wax kasta oo jira.
Enough room.	Ku filan qolka.
This is what we need.	Tani waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
It took me a long time and a lot of time	Waxa aan u qaatay wakhti wakhti iyo waqti badan
I was not ready to come back here soon	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan halkan ku soo noqdo dhawaan
I would always be there.	Had iyo jeer waan joogi lahaa halkaas.
I would do anything to get it	Waxaan sameyn lahaa wax kasta si aan u helo
I was really impressed	Runtii aad baan ula dhacay
I did it for you.	waan kuu sameeyay.
I really think she does	Waxaan runtii u maleynayaa inay sameyso
That was so beautiful.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aad u qurux badan.
I suspect he desperately needs money	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu aad ugu baahan yahay lacag
I know it was done	Waxaan ogahay in la sameeyay
I should not have left him	Ma ahayn inaan isaga tago
This was, he felt.	Tani waxay ahayd, wuxuu dareemay.
I was a little surprised	Waan yara yaabay
I will do this whether you like it or not.	Waxaan samayn doonaa tan haddii aad jeceshahay iyo haddii kale.
I expect a lot from you.	Wax badan ayaan kaa filayaa.
I will not go there again	Mar dambe halkaas ma tagi doono
I never wanted anyone else.	Weligay maan rabin qof kale.
I do not believe this	Maan rumaysan tan
I heard enough.	Waxaan maqlay wax igu filan.
You know, food.	Waad ogtahay, cunto.
I know you know.	Waan ogahay inaad ogtahay.
You can leave	Waad ka bixi kartaa
This is everything.	Tani waa wax walba.
I have not done that yet	Taas weli maan samayn
I decided on the latter	Waxaan go'aansaday kan dambe
I don't think it's much more difficult than that.	Uma maleynayo inay aad uga dhib badan tahay taas.
I told her it was the same.	Waxaan u sheegay inay isku mid tahay.
This is not the right thing to do.	Tani maaha wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
It's hard to be otherwise.	Way adag tahay inay si kale noqon karto.
No one wanted to do it.	Qofna ma doonayn inuu sameeyo.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
I have been here before.	Hore ayaan halkan u joogay.
I have to do this.	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa.
But something worse.	Laakiin wax baa ka xun.
I do not exist.	Anigu ma jiro.
I can be anywhere, he thought	Meel kasta waan joogi karaa, ayuu is yidhi
But only if you have nothing better to do.	Laakiin kaliya haddii aadan haysan wax ka fiican oo aad sameyso.
But, we will see.	Laakiin, waan arki doonaa.
There was another man	Nin kale ayaa jiray
Also.	Sidoo kale.
It just wasn't right.	Kaliya sax ma ahayn.
I do not.	Ma samaynayo.
I just know.	Kaliya waan ogahay.
I would really like to be friends	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan saaxiibo noqdo
There is no one like you.	Mid kula mid ah ma jiro.
But that was not the only reason.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn sababta kaliya.
He felt lucky to have one.	Wuxuu dareemay nasiib inuu mid haysto.
He did not come.	Ma iman.
I know you know it's true.	Waan ogahay inaad ogtahay inay run tahay.
Real.	Mid dhab ah.
Not surprisingly similar.	Ma aha wax la yaab leh oo la mid ah.
Just tell me	Kaliya ii sheeg
He never wanted to.	Waligiis ma uu rabin.
But there was so much.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax aad u badan.
I knew we could do it	Waan ogaa inaan sameyn karno
In fact, it is not a problem.	Dhab ahaantii, dhib maaha.
I hope he is able to help us	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu awoodo inuu na caawiyo
I went to see you, to find you.	Waxaan u aaday inaan arko, si aan kuu helo.
You still need it.	Wali waad u baahan tahay.
I tried to be tough	Waxaan isku dayay inaan noqdo mid adag
I had to find out what was wrong	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado wax aan sax ahayn
I really know what you want	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa waxaad rabto
So there was a lot of this.	Marka waxaa jiray wax badan oo tan ah.
I still want to see	Wali waxaan rabaa inaan arko
I want him here tomorrow	Waxaan rabaa isaga berrito halkan
I think that has something to do with it	Waxaan filayaa in taasi wax leedahay
Anyone can do that now.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa taas hadda.
I am ready now	hadda diyaar ayaan ahay
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
They make money they love.	Waxay sameeyaan lacag waxay jecel yihiin.
I do not like to stay in one place for long	Ma jecli inaan hal meel sii joogo wakhti dheer
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
I just want to know what it looks like	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida ay u egtahay
I wanted something new	Waxaan rabay wax cusub
Can anyone tell me how to do it.	Qof ma ii sheegi karaa sida loo samayn karo.
You alone.	Adiga keligaa.
There are so many of us.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo naga mid ah.
I want to know what they contain	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado waxa ay ku jiraan
Much of the former	Wax badan oo ka mid ah hore
I just want something done	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in wax la sameeyo
What, now? 	Maxaa jira, hadda?
.	.
And not just here.	Oo halkan kaliya maaha.
I was really busy	Runtii aad ayaan mashquul u ahaa
I really couldn’t help it.	Si dhab ah ayaan u caawin waayay.
I had a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay.
There are several cars in one.	Waa dhowr baabuur oo mid ka mid ah.
Exactly what we have to do.	Dhab ahaan waxa ay tahay in aan samayno.
I had to find out what was going on	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa socda
Made in three years.	Lagu sameeyay muddo saddex sano ah.
That should be enough for him.	Taasi waa inay ku filan tahay isaga.
I really want to leave	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
She refused, for the most part.	Way diiday, inta badan.
I’ve never, ever had anything interesting before	Weligay, weligay ma helin wax xiiso leh ka hor
I took it for granted.	Waxaan u qaatay wax la’aan.
It is 'like'.	Waa 'sida'.
I wanted to do this	Waxaan rabay inaan tan sameeyo
I was there and I was not there yet	Waan joogay wali halkaas ma joogin
I would do nothing for it	Waxba waan u samayn lahaa
And maybe.	Oo laga yaabaa.
I wanted to be him.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo isaga.
I found us.	Waan na helay.
I heard it a long time ago	Waxaan maqlay waa hore
I just didn't think it was true	Kaliya uma malaynayn inay run tahay
I thought you could come back	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad soo noqon karto
I knew that now.	Taas hadda waan ogaa.
I bought it.	Waan iibsaday.
Nothing bad will happen.	Wax xun ma dhici doono.
There is not enough time.	Ma jiro waqti ku filan.
She will go, but she will not stay.	Way tagi doontaa, laakiin ma joogi doono.
But he felt it.	Laakiin wuu dareemay.
I thought you were older	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ka weyn tahay
I have the truth.	run baan ku hayaa.
I know you will be good to me	Waan ogahay inaad ii fiicnaan doonto
I hope someone can help you here.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof halkan ku caawin karo.
I could not afford one	Ma awoodin mid
It can happen to you.	Way kugu dhici kartaa adiga.
I have no idea where he lives.	Meel uu ku nool yahay wax fikrad ah uma hayo.
I really enjoyed it here	Runtii waan ka helay halkan
Not just much.	Ma aha wax badan oo kaliya.
This is great for me.	Tani waa aniga mid weyn.
I love working with you	Waan jeclahay inaan adiga kula shaqeeyo
Tell them what you think.	U sheeg waxa kula tahay.
Much like a car.	Wax badan sida baabuur.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
I told him that was true	Waxaan u sheegay in taasi run tahay
I am very happy to talk to you today	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan maanta kula hadlo
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
I knew it would come.	Waan ogaa inay iman doonto.
This was three years ago.	Tani waxay ahayd saddex sano ka hor.
But he did not say this.	Laakiin ma uusan sheegin tan.
I wanted to do it here	Waxaan rabay inaan halkan ku sameeyo
I say they do.	Waxaan leeyahay way sameeyaan.
They will help him.	Way caawin doonaan isaga.
I would love to come back again soon	Waxaan jeclahay inaan mar kale soo noqdo mar dhow
I have never done homework	Weligay shaqada guriga maan samayn
Can someone please help?	Qof fadlan ma caawin karaa.
I would love to do something for you	Waxaan jeclahay in aan wax kuu sameeyo
I found a lot of interesting things	Waxaan ka helay waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh
She would be another great friend, too.	Waxay noqon lahayd saaxiib kale oo weyn, sidoo kale.
In fact, he never got a chance.	Run ahaantii, waligiis fursad ma helin.
There really is no.	Runtii ma jiro.
I have to know more about it.	Waa inaan wax badan ka ogaado.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
But it is so.	Laakiin waa sidaas.
It is better to go home	Waxa fiican in aan guriga aado
I just hope it helps	Kaliya waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto
I hope they are not the same	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan isku mid ahayn
But there was more than this.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan tan.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
It was a terrible time	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u xun
I would love to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
I will do everything to stay with you	Wax walba waan samayn doonaa inaan kula joogo
A little more difficult than you	In yar oo kaa dhib badan
I can't believe what happened now	Ma rumaysan karo waxa hadda dhacay
There really isn't much to like here.	Runtii wax badan oo aan halkan laga jeclayn ma jiraan.
Please, me.	Fadlan, aniga.
As everyone who knows him knows.	Sida qof kasta oo ku yaqaan uu garanayo.
Here, there was no problem.	Halkan, wax dhib ah ma jirin.
I really liked him	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay isaga
I will get more done by you.	Wax badan oo aad sameyso ayaan heli doonaa.
I did not want to leave	Maan rabin inaan baxo
That would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd sidaas.
I will see you	waan ku arki doonaa
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
He was a very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u fiican.
I had a lot to do tomorrow	Waxaan lahaa wax badan oo aan berri sameeyo
I did not know who they were.	Maan garanayn cidda ay yihiin.
I got everything I needed	Waxaan helay wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay
Not here.	Halkan ma jiro.
Not sure how.	Ma hubo sida.
No one wants to talk to me.	Qofna ma rabo inuu ila hadlo.
I really didn't come for anything else	Run ahaantii wax kale maan iman
will do it first.	marka hore samayn doonaa.
I can't believe that	Ma rumaysan karo taas
It could be later	Waxay noqon kartaa mar dambe
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegi jirin.
I will come tomorrow	Berri ayaan iman doonaa
I do not feel anything	waxba ma dareemayo
But this is true.	Laakiin tani waa dhab.
No luck today.	Nasiib ma leh maanta.
I am very happy he is still alive	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inuu weli nool yahay
I thought that was less intelligent	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay taasi ka caqli yar tahay
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
Don't tell me it's still nothing.	Ha ii sheegin in aanay weli waxba ahayn.
It is unknown.	Waa mid aan la garanayn.
I have not seen much	In badan kuma arag
But he would do what he could.	Laakiin wuu samayn lahaa wuxuu awoodo.
I did not want to leave	Ma rabin inaan la baxo
I am very sorry for many things	Aad baan uga xumahay waxyaabo badan
I don't know where anyone else lives	Ma garanayo meel qof kale ku nool yahay
I should not have told anyone	Ma ahayn inaan cidna u sheego
Everyone is a friend to us.	Qof walba waa noo saaxiib.
It was taken away.	Waa laga qaaday.
Something really.	Wax dhab ahaantii.
I love being with you	Waan jeclahay inaan kula joogo
I did not understand until later why	Maan fahmin ilaa ka dib sababta
A man with.	Nin leh.
Nothing else.	Ma wax kale.
Do you think that is the case.	Ma u malaynaysaa inay taasi tahay.
No matter what you do.	Dhib malaha waxaad samaynayso.
Same idea here.	Fikrad la mid ah halkan.
I heard they are good	Waxaan maqlay inay wanaagsan yihiin
I think it is hard enough	Waxaan filayaa inuu dhib ku filan yahay
I was still amazed	Weli waxaa iga muuqday yaab
I need to get a job	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqo helo
I did not want to be here	Maan rabin inaan halkan joogo
I have not seen him in three years	Saddex sano maan arag isaga
I need to know why you need it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta aad ugu baahan tahay
He was a really good friend.	Runtii saaxiib wanaagsan buu ahaa.
He did not want to do this.	Ma uusan rabin inuu tan sameeyo.
I, for one, know that it can be done.	Anigu, mid, waan ogahay in la samayn karo.
I can also help myself	Sidoo kale waan is caawin karaa
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
It will no longer be good.	Mar dambe ma fiicnaan doono.
Still not good this was a good idea	Wali ma aan ahayn mid wanaagsan tani waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan
I am always happy for you	Had iyo jeer waan kugu faraxsanahay
But we would happen to something much worse.	Laakiin waxaan ku dhici lahayn wax aad uga xun.
He knows that, now.	Taas wuu garanayaa, hadda.
I do not want to know anymore	Ma doonayo inaan mar dambe ogaado
You should not have done that.	Ma ahayn inaad sidaas samayso.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
They are enough.	Way ku filan yihiin.
I knew they would never do such a thing again	Waan ogaa in aysan mar dambe sameyn doonin wax sidaas oo kale ah
You know you are.	Waad ogtahay inaad tahay.
He had a real job.	Waxa uu lahaa shaqo dhab ah.
I have to say it exists	Waa inaan sheego inay jirto
So far everything is fine.	Ilaa hadda wax walba waa wanaagsan yihiin.
And after every time.	Oo wakhti kasta ka dib.
I would definitely go back	Hubaal waan ku noqon lahaa
This is who she is.	Tani waa qofka ay tahay.
Everyone was something.	Qof walba wax buu ahaa.
I am still with you.	ilaa hadda waan kula jiraa.
I thought you already did	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad mar hore samaysay
I could not let her do it again	Uma ogolaan karin inay mar kale sameyso
I would have stayed earlier.	Hore ayaan u joogi lahaa.
But from time to time.	Laakiin waqti ka waqti.
Not for everyone, not always, but often enough.	Ma aha qof walba, had iyo jeer maaha, laakiin inta badan ku filan.
I really want to help	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
I won't even stay if he doesn't want me.	Xitaa ma sii joogi doono haddii uusan i rabin.
He was unable to speak.	Wuu awoodi waayay inuu hadlo.
And it is likely to happen.	Oo waxay u badan tahay inay dhici doonto.
A little harder.	Yar oo adag.
He wanted that.	Taas wuu rabay.
He is not here now.	Hadda ma joogo halkan.
I really like that	Aad ayaan u jeclahay taas
I took it, in the same way.	Waan ka qaaday, si la mid ah.
I don't seem to be doing that	uma eka in aan taas sameeyo
I'm not sure if this is true.	Ma hubo in tani run tahay.
I am very happy to do that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan taas sameeyo.
Maybe still time	Waxaa laga yaabaa in weli waqti
I seem to be back here again	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan mar kale halkan ku soo noqday
I know they have no bad money	Waan ogahay inaysan haysan wax lacag ah oo xun
He is alive.	Wuu nool yahay.
I can't make you do it.	Kuma yeeli karo inaad sameyso.
Very bad, really.	Aad u xun, runtii.
I knew they would be there	Waan ogaa inay halkaas joogi doonaan
I've heard it before	Hadda ka hor ayaan maqlay
I just want you to know	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
I saw it a few years ago	Waxaan arkay dhowr sano ka hor
Everyone wants to do that.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu taas sameeyo.
I am all for that	Aniga oo dhan taas ayaan ahay
Something like that.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah.
Something different than before.	Wax aan la mid ahayn sidii hore.
Everyone has to do it.	Qof walba waa inuu sameeyaa.
I will do the right one for the other.	Waxaan si sax ah u samayn doonaa kan kale.
I have no idea	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto
He would definitely help me.	Hubaal wuu i caawin lahaa.
Not sure now.	Ma hubo hadda.
I love it so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay
I decided to go there, too	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan aado halkaas, sidoo kale
I think it is right again	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay mar kale sax tahay
And it really was.	Oo runtii waxay ahayd.
I can’t be the reason for that.	Ma noqon karo sababta taas.
Maybe there is something in it.	Malaha wax baa ku jira.
Everything is a thing.	Wax walba waa wax.
It's like.	Waa sida.
He knew what was coming.	Wuu ogaa waxa soo socda.
I do not want to do anything	Ma rabo inaan wax sameeyo
I really could not say what was going on	Runtii ma sheegi karin waxa socda
It was me.	Aniga waxay ahayd.
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
I can't lie.	Been uma sheegi karo.
I think for a while	Waxaan u maleynayaa in muddo ah
I did not want to talk about it	Maan rabin inaan ka hadlo
That cannot be done.	Taas lama samayn karo.
I just knew he needed me	Waxa kaliya oo aan ogaa in uu ii baahan yahay
I did it once	Waxaan sameeyay hal mar
I really do, you know	Runtii waan sameeyaa, waad ogtahay
I will be a little bit of everything	Waxaan noqon doonaa wax yar oo wax walba ah
He told me everything was set.	Wuxuu ii sheegay in wax walba la dhigay.
I wanted to be wanted	Waxaan rabay in la i rabo
The same was found.	Si la mid ah ayaa loo helay .
I really lost everything, everyone	Runtii wax walba waan waayay, qof walba
I told him he could take it	Waxaan u sheegay inuu qaadan karo
I have to know who they are.	Waa inaan garanayaa cidda ay yihiin.
Just what you want to do.	Kaliya waxaad rabto inaad sameyso.
I want to be friends with you	Waxaan rabaa in aan adiga kula saaxiibo
What was that?	Maxay ahayd taasi.
He is still my favorite.	Wali waa kan aan jeclahay.
I have to stay somewhere.	Waa inaan meel joogo.
Also the worst.	Sidoo kale kan ugu xun.
Again and again.	Mar iyo mar kale.
I did not think he would find me	Uma malaynayn inuu i heli doono
I don't want to do anything to you.	Ma doonayo in aan wax kugu sameeyo.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
No one should ever tell me anything.	Ma aha in qofna waligiis wax ii sheego.
Something going on here.	Wax ka socda halkan.
We should not even be here first	Waa inaan xitaa halkaan joogin marka hore
I still do not know how.	Wali ma garanayo sida.
It was a bad day at work.	Waxay ahayd maalin xun shaqada.
I knew that for sure	Waan ogaa taas hubaal
I like.	waan jeclahay.
He does other things, too.	Wuxuu sameeyaa waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
I do not have to leave you	Maaha inaan kaa tago
But not much.	Laakiin maaha wax badan.
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax weyn.
I know there is a chance of that	Waan ogahay inay jirto fursad taas
I felt a little better	Waxaan dareemay xoogaa fiicnaan
I know very little about you	Wax yar ayaan kaa ogahay
No one believed me.	Qofna ima rumaysan.
I think it's not surprising how it can be	Waxaan filayaa inaysan la yaab lahayn sida ay noqon karto
I will not leave again	Mar dambe ma bixi doono
That's more.	Taas sii tan.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I must be very sorry	Waa inaan aad uga xumahay
I thought they would both take it badly	Waxaan u maleeyay inay labaduba si xun u qaadan doonaan
That's right now.	Waa sidaas hadda.
We wish you were there.	Waxaan jeclaan lahayn inaad halkaas joogi lahayd.
I looked good	Waxaan u muuqday mid wanaagsan
I had no idea	Wax fikrad ah kama helin
I liked it a lot.	Wax badan ayaan ka helay.
Very good money	Lacag aad u fiican
Hold on, hold on, hold on.	Qabo, qabo, qabo.
I do not know what happened to me.	Ma garanayo waxa igu soo dhacay.
I tried to learn.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax barto.
I enjoyed it	Xiiso ayaan ka helay
He knows me very well.	Aad ayuu ii garanayaa.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I knew what was coming	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda
I looked, but found nothing	Waan eegay, laakiin waxba ma aan helin
It was decided quickly.	Si degdeg ah baa loo go'aansaday.
I thought it was beautiful	Waxaan mooday inay qurux badan tahay
I will not do it	Ma yeeli doono
You can do the same.	Waxaad samayn kartaa sidaas oo kale.
I tried, first.	Waan isku dayay, marka hore.
I really have to go	Runtii waa inaan aado
You need something else.	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax kale.
Nothing stopped.	Waxba ma joojin.
Now, this is the same thing.	Hadda, tani waa wax la mid ah.
Three times, really.	Saddex jeer, dhab ahaantii.
I knew it was a problem.	Waan ogaa inay dhib ahayd.
They must do so.	Waa inay sidaas sameeyaan.
She said I want to talk about it.	Waxay tidhi waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo.
But none of us did.	Laakiin mid naga mid ah ma samayn.
But a good man.	Laakiin nin wanaagsan.
I will talk to you from time to time	Waqti ka waqti ayaan kula hadli doonaa
He refused to talk to me.	Wuu diiday inuu ila hadlo.
I think he can get it	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu heli karo
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
It did not help	Ma caawin
The door to the room.	Albaabka qolka.
No one is at home.	Qofna ma joogo guriga.
I felt good knowing that	Waxaan dareemay fiicnaan inaan taas ogaado
What you want but do not want.	Waxa aad rabto laakiin aadan rabin.
I couldn't believe it.	Waan rumaysan waayay.
But I must.	Laakiin waa in aan.
I will not do that.	Ma yeeli doono taas.
I will not be able to say.	Ma awoodi doono inaan sheego.
So she did.	Sidaas bay samaysay.
As you will see soon, that is not true.	Sida aad dhawaan arki doonto, taasi run maaha.
That can take a very long time.	Taasi waxay qaadan kartaa waqti aad u dheer.
He said that was correct.	Wuxuu sheegay in taasi sax tahay.
I do not know what to do, either.	Waxaan sameeyo ma garanayo, sidoo kale.
I doubt that is true	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inaysan taasi run ahayn
This was good to know.	Tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan in la ogaado.
it was set for me	waa la ii dhigay
I just couldn't tell anyone	Kaliya qofna uma sheegi karin
You can be a real person.	Waxaad noqon kartaa qof dhab ah.
I thought she did	Waxaan mooday inay samaysay
She's really smart.	Runtii aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
He tried again.	Mar kale ayuu isku dayay.
It has always been.	Waligiis wuu ahaan jiray.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
It really is a lot to eat.	Runtii waa wax badan in la cuno.
I didn't know you were too much.	Maan ogayn inaad wax badan kugu jirto.
I thought you did too	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad sidoo kale samaysay
He who knows nothing.	Kii aan waxba ogayn.
.	.
It didn't matter who he was, or how much money he had.	Dhib ma lahayn cidda uu yahay, iyo inta lacag ee uu haysto.
Now that could be a good thing !.	Hadda taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan!.
I can't do anything right now	Hadda waxba kama qaban karo
And so far, it is.	Oo ilaa hadda, waa.
I have never seen him like that	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale
I liked what he said.     	Waan ka helay waxa uu yidhi.     
I think it could go well	Waxaan filayaa inay si fiican u dhici karto
I want it all, you know? 	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan, ma ogtahay?
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
It has never been.	Waligiis ma ahaan jirin.
I want to learn more	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan barto
You can't do this.	Ma samayn kartid tan oo kale.
I will give you time	waqti ayaan ku siin doonaa
Too much work.	Shaqo aad u badan.
I have to leave you	Waa inaan kaa tago
It was amazing what everyone did.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh waxa qof walba sameeyay.
For the most part, it is not.	Inta badan, ma aha.
I say	waxaan leeyahay
I would give it time	Waxaan siin lahaa waqti
I fell behind.	Dib ayaan u dhacay.
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
I need you to do something great for me right	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ii sameyso wax weyn oo sax ah
There really aren't.	Runtii ma jiraan.
I think it is very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u fiican tahay.
They are all in this together.	Waxay ku wada jiraan arrintan.
I really can't take it	Runtii ma qaadan karo
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad.
She did not want to be near.	Ma ay rabin meel u dhow.
I gave you what you want	Waxaan ku siiyay waxaad rabto
She will probably get more again.	Waxay u badan tahay inay mar kale heli doonto wax badan.
I do not think it exists.	U malayn maayo inay jirto.
He got it right.	Si fiican ayuu u helay.
Not that it was much.	Ma aha in ay ahayd wax badan.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
This could be how things are.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa sida ay wax yihiin.
You can do the same.	Waxaad samayn kartaa sidaas oo kale.
That would be beautiful.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid qurux badan.
I lost everything.	Wax walba waan waayay.
If he ever does.	Haddii uu waligiis sameeyo.
It was done a long time ago.	Wax badan ka hor ayaa la sameeyay.
Which she does.	Taas oo ay samayso.
I still think it exists	Weli waxaan qabaa inay jirto
I did not give.	Anigu ma siin.
I just don’t like it.	Ma jecli kaliya.
It would hurt someone.	Qof buu wax yeeli lahaa.
You do not need a happy person.	Uma baahnid qof ku faraxsan.
This was untrue.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aan run ahayn.
And each one got as it was.	Oo mid kastaa wuxuu helay sidii uu ahaa.
I said nothing else	Wax kale ma odhan
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
I became a much better person	Waxaan noqday qof aad uga wanaagsan
But not now.	Laakiin hadda maaha.
I definitely will not stay there	Dhab ahaantii ma sii joogi doono halkaas
I don't see any problem	Dhib ma arko
I just don’t.	Kaliya ma sameeyo.
I'm really sorry before, I'm sorry for everything	Runtii waan ka xumahay mar hore, wax walba waan ka xumahay
I am happy	Waan ku faraxsanahay
I did a good job, too	Shaqo wanaagsan ayaan sameeyay, sidoo kale
I really can't see anything else	Runtii wax kale ma arki karo
I just know he has a problem	Kaliya waan ogahay inuu dhib qabo
Something we have never seen before.	Wax aanu hore u arag.
I did not know where or from	Meel iyo waxaan ka yimid maan garanayn
But that, too, is how things are.	Laakiin taasi, sidoo kale, waa sida ay wax yihiin.
I like to work hard.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan si adag u shaqeeyo.
This needs to be discussed.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay in laga wada hadlo.
I looked and he is there	Waan eegay oo waa uu joogaa
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto.
I also found everything very difficult	Waxaan sidoo kale helay wax kasta oo aad u adag
I think there is something wrong with us.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax nagu jiraan.
I do not understand why this is	Ma fahmin sababta tan
They still exist.	Wali waa ay jiraan.
I’m sure they are also very good	Waxaan hubaa inay sidoo kale aad u fiican yihiin
It can always be good	Had iyo jeer way fiicnaan kartaa
It's a terrible place	Waa meel aad u xun
You just know it is the way you are.	Kaliya waad ogtahay inay tahay sida aad tahay.
He had another idea.	Waxa uu lahaa fikrad kale.
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
And he never did anything after that.	Oo waligiis waxba ma uu samayn ka dib.
I told him to back off, but he refused	Waxaan u sheegay inuu ka noqdo, laakiin wuu diiday
We were friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo.
I knew you would not go	Waan ogaa inaadan tagi doonin
That is the only thing.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya.
It could be any time now.	Waxay noqon kartaa wakhti kasta hadda.
That is true.	Waa run taas.
He lives there today.	Halkaas ayuu maanta ku nool yahay.
I need you to be here with me now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkan ila joogto hadda
I really took it badly	Runtii waan u qaatay si xun
Just a bit.	Kaliya xoogaa.
It will take a long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti dheer.
you are right	sax baad tahay
I have a great day tomorrow	Waxaan leeyahay maalin weyn berri
Tell me more.	Wax badan ii sheeg.
I don't know why he does that.	Ma garanayo sababta uu sidaas u sameeyo.
You know he loves me.	Waad ogtahay inuu i jecel yahay.
I think she is much older than him	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay aad uga weyn tahay isaga
I wanted to talk to you	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo
He did this to me.	Waxa uu igu sameeyay tan.
It's better not to talk about it.	Waxaa fiican inaanan ka hadlin.
I have no idea how he knew.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida uu ku ogaa.
I really do not know	Runtii ma garanayo
He does whatever he likes.	Wuxuu sameeyaa wax kasta oo uu jecel yahay.
But it will be done.	Laakiin waa la samayn doonaa.
I wanted to do it	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo
Everything else was there.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa jiray.
It is good when available.	Way fiican tahay marka la helo.
I could not see anything	Wax baan arki waayay
Really, that’s good.	Run ahaantii, taasi way fiican tahay.
But she will not get that.	Laakiin taas ma heli doonto.
But it did not help.	Laakiin ma caawin.
I could not see him	Anigu ma aan arki karin isaga
Something else happened.	Wax kale ayaa ku dhacay.
I really know what to do now	Runtii waan garanayaa waxa aan sameeyo hadda
You may not need to do anything.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan u baahnayn inaad wax sameyso.
Not very popular, but also unpopular.	Ma aha mid aad loo jecel yahay, laakiin sidoo kale aan la jeclayn.
It was really amazing.	Runtii waxay ahayd yaab.
I can't stay here.	Halkan ma joogi karo.
I did not give anything.	Waxba ma siin.
It's a problem.	Waa dhibaato.
It was not me.	Aniga ma ahayn.
I do not think this is the same.	U malayn maayo in tani mid tahay.
I don't like how we live now	Ma jecli sida aan hadda u nool nahay
They may be overworked.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay yihiin shaqo badan.
I think it will take a long time	Waxaan filayaa inay muddo dheer qaadan doonto
But there is nothing there.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax halkaas.
I need to do it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad.
Here it is beautiful, everywhere.	Halkan waa qurux, meel kasta.
Not to talk is to talk.	In aan la hadlin waa in la hadlo.
Not once, not once.	Ma aha hal mar, ma aha kii hore.
So, so far no luck.	Marka, ilaa hadda nasiib ma leh.
I want more than anything else right now	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan wax kasta oo kale hadda
I don't understand a bit.	Xoogaa kuma fahmin.
It was probably too small.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd mid aad u yar.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
It is very good.	Waa mid aad u wanaagsan.
I know what happened.	Waan ogahay waxa dhacay.
You only have to do this once.	Waa inaad tan sameyso hal mar kaliya.
He does not want to leave	Ma rabo inuu baxo
I hope they will be fine	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiicnaan doonaan
I do everything.	Wax walba waan sameeyaa.
I will do that for you	Taas ayaan kuu samayn doonaa
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
Give it a chance.	Fursad sii.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad rabto
No one spoke.	Cidna lama hadlin.
We are really back.	Run ahaantii waa nala noqday.
I could not take anything	Waxba maan qaadan karin
Give it a chance.	Fursad sii.
I did not know you could do that	Maan ogayn inaad taas samayn karto
It can be seen	Waa la arki karaa
I looked	Waan eegay
There was none.	Ma jirin.
I told them they were beautiful	Waxaan u sheegay inay qurux badan yihiin
I think he is a little younger than me	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu iga yara yar yahay
He can only do that.	Kaliya wuu samayn karaa.
It can't hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli karto.
I think I need nothing	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan waxba u baahnayn
I owe you a lot now	Hadda wax badan baan kugu leeyahay
He seems to be feeling it.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu dareemayo.
Everyone wanted to stay.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu joogo.
But also beautiful.	Laakiin sidoo kale qurux badan.
Now I can not stay close every day	Hadda ma joogi karo meel dhow maalin kasta
A great place to be, too.	Meel aad u fiican waa, sidoo kale.
Not sure how they do it.	Ma hubo sida ay u sameeyaan.
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqo tago
He was real.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dhab ah.
I started immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayaan u bilaabay.
I began to see.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan arko.
I hope so	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas tahay
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I just can't get it right	Kaliya si sax ah uma heli karo
Would you please provide something new?	Fadlan ma bixin kartaa wax cusub?
I took time to get there.	Waqti ayaan ku qaatay inaan halkaas tago.
I do not have much time	Ma haysto waqti badan
Three years longer.	Saddex sano oo dheer.
I would love to do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas samayno.
I knew you would come back	Waan ogaa inaad soo noqon doonto
This can quickly backfire.	Tani waxay si degdeg ah dib ugu noqon kartaa.
So far, nothing is too bad.	Ilaa hadda, ma jiraan wax aad u xun.
I hope it is the same for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay isku mid kugu tahay.
I came out alive	Aniga oo nool ayaan ka soo baxay
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I told her she would come home tomorrow	Waxaan u sheegay inay berri guriga iman doonto
A little trouble here	Dhibaato yar halkan
I thought that was really good for him	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi runtii isaga u wanaagsan tahay
They found nothing.	Waxba kama ay helin.
I knew there was something, but it was not	Waan ogaa in ay wax jiraan, laakiin sidaas maaha
I have already started again.	Mar kale ayaan hore u bilaabay.
Runtii.	Runtii.
He had a good year.	Hal sano oo wanaagsan ayuu qaatay.
I know there are other things	Waan ogahay inay jiraan waxyaabo kale
I would love to see them all	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wada arko
I know it's not true.	Waan ogahay inaysan run ahayn.
I think he is a very good man	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu yahay nin aad u fiican
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
He was here.	Wuu joogay halkan.
This has been found.	Tani waa la helay.
I decided there was definitely something else	Waxaan go'aansaday in hubaal ay wax kale jiraan
You are the person he wants to be with.	Adiga ayaa ah qofka uu rabo in uu la joogo.
How little we can get out of it.	Inta yar ee aan ka bixi karno.
He used to come to it.	Wuu u iman jiray.
You must be in one place now.	Waa in aad hadda hal meel joogto.
I don't want to.	Ma rabo inaan.
If he had time.	Haddii uu waqti u lahaa.
He is really good at it.	Runtii wuu ku fiican yahay.
He said nothing, but it did not matter	Waxba uma sheegin, laakiin dhib ma lahayn
He never came out again.	Mar dambe ma uusan soo bixin.
Maybe it's a day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay maalin tahay.
I wondered what he wanted	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu rabo
I have to tell you something once and for all	Waa inaan wax kuu sheego mar iyo dhammaan
I am one like this.	Waxaan ka mid ahay sida tan.
It was the same as before.	Waxay ahayd sidii hore oo kale.
I felt the same way	Waxaan dareemay sidaas oo kale
I want you to be there	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaas joogto
I just want to stay	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan iska joogo
I wanted to see you.	Waxaan rabay inaan ku arko.
Maybe I will see him again.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar kale arko isaga.
I would do it	Waan samayn lahaa
I can do a good job here	Shaqo wanaagsan ayaan halkan ka qaban karaa
This is how.	Tani waa sida.
I do not want to do this.	Ma doonayo inaan tan sameeyo.
Here is another one.	Waa kan mid kale.
I have a similar problem.	Dhibaato taas la mid ah ayaan qabaa.
This is not really the same.	Tani dhab ahaantii isku mid maaha.
This is the only time it is mentioned	Tani waa marka kaliya ee la sheego
That is the job, really.	Taasi waa shaqada, runtii.
You probably know.	Waxay u badan tahay inaad ogtahay.
I saw you there.	Halkaas ayaan ku arkay.
This was unsuccessful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aan lagu guulaysan.
I did not do anything good	Wax wanaagsan maan samayn
That is why he did it.	Taasi waa sababta uu u sameeyay.
I hope you like it	Waxaan filayaa inaad jeclaan lahayd
I did not understand much	Wax badan maan fahmin
I am not the same	Anigu isku mid ma ihi
It looks good, he thought.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan, ayuu u maleeyay.
He seemed to have no need to eat.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aan u baahnayn in uu wax cuno.
I think that is enough tonight	Waxay ila tahay in taas caawa ku filan tahay
He is not a beloved person.	Ma aha qof la jecel yahay.
I saw it everywhere	Meel walba waan ku arkay
Not right.	Sax maaha .
But only.	Laakiin kaliya.
I should not have done that	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas sameeyo
I did for a while.	Waxaan sameeyay muddo.
As you did.	Sida aad samaysay.
I can hardly believe what he says	Si dhib ah ayaan u rumaysan karaa waxa uu leeyahay
I wonder how that will be.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay taasi noqon doonto.
There was no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jirin.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
I can stay with you here	Waan kula joogi karaa halkan
No matter where he was.	Dhib ma lahayn meesha uu joogo.
I have never seen that before.	Weligay taas hore uma arag.
It was nice to see.	Waxay ahayd wax fiican in la arko.
There is a lot to do here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo halkan lagu sameeyo.
He beautifully does everything right	Wuxuu si qurux badan u sameeyaa wax kasta oo sax ah
He looked good.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I can't do it now	Ma awoodin hadda
Tell us where we are going !.	Noo sheeg halka aan aadi doono!.
This is a great thing.	Tani waa wax aad u weyn.
I decided to do it	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sameeyo
But it will take something like that.	Laakiin waxay qaadan doontaa wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I hope you like it	Waxaan filayaa inaad jeclaan lahayd
I can't tell you anymore	Mar dambe ma kuu sheegi karo
It had nothing to do with him.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn isaga.
Really, really is.	Runtii, runtii waa.
I got more than enough	Waxaan helay wax ka badan oo igu filan
I felt a little better	Waxaan dareemay xoogaa fiicnaan
Nothing can be done	Waxba lama qaban karo
And they will probably be right.	Oo waxay u badan tahay inay sax noqon doonaan.
At first there were only a few.	Markii hore waxaa jiray dhowr kaliya.
In fact, he should not have done it.	Dhab ahaantii, ma ahayn inuu sameeyo.
I wonder what happened	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa dhacay
That is good for us.	Taasi waa nagu fiican tahay.
That is the obvious reason.	Taasi waa sababta cad.
I hope everyone has a great day	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu leeyahay maalin weyn
I never knew, really	Weligay maan garanayn, runtii
I didn't have to speak, very lively	Ma ahayn inaan hadlo, aad u nool
One does, one before the other.	Mid wuxuu sameeyaa, mid ka hor inta kale.
Maybe this was true.	Malaha tani run bay ahayd.
It will help you do it.	Wuxuu kaa caawin doonaa inaad sameyso.
But maybe it was true.	Laakiin malaha run bay ahayd.
And something other than you.	Oo wax aan adiga ahayn.
I'm sorry about that	Waan ka xumahay taas
Sida.	Sida.
I know you will	Waan ogahay inaad yeeli doonto
You are so loved, you will find any man you want.	Aad baad u jeceshahay, waxaad heli doontaa nin kasta oo aad rabto.
More to learn.	Wax badan in la barto.
I looked back	dib ayaan u eegay
I want to know who did this	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda tan samaysay
Both at once.	Labaduba hal mar.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
This is not what we saw today.	Tani ma aha waxa maanta la arkay.
Until you.	Ilaa adiga.
I will not stop if that is what you really want	Kuma joojin doono haddii taasi ay tahay waxa aad runtii rabto
Not just money.	Lacag kaliya maaha.
It is very new.	Aad bay u cusub tahay.
I am better.	Aniga ayaa iga fiican.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jiro.
Now I have an exciting time	Hadda waxaan helay waqti xiiso leh
Still, there is.	Weli, waxaa jira.
I could not help, I did not want to help	Ma caawin karin, ma rabin inaan caawiyo
There are many of us.	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaa jira.
I knew you would need that	Waan ogaa inaad taas u baahan doonto
And a lot of them.	Iyo wax badan oo ka mid ah.
Good food, everyone !.	Cunto wanaagsan, qof walba!.
I did not take anything from anyone	Anigu ma aan qaadan wax qof leeyahay
I always talked to him	Mar walba waan kala hadli jiray isaga
I hope they are real.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhab yihiin.
Do not leave.	Ha ka tagin.
From now on it is me and you.	Hadda ka dib waa aniga iyo adiga.
Anyway it's a big job.	Si walba waa shaqo weyn.
When a problem	Marka dhibaato
That would be a lie.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd been.
I can't believe that	Ma rumaysan karo taas
I have to do that.	Waa inaan taas sameeyaa.
Maybe you can really help me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad runtii i caawin karto.
I have no problem right now	Wax dhib ah igama haysto hadda
I want to take it	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka qaado
You were someone else.	Waxaad ahayd qof kale.
I would give it until tomorrow.	Waxaan siin lahaa ilaa berri.
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan doonto
Well, he thought, that's how it is.	Wanaagsan, ayuu is yidhi, waa sida ay tahay.
He really wanted to talk.	Aad buu u rabay inuu hadlo.
I thought it was really smart	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii caqli badan tahay
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	U sheeg inuu sheego wuxuu leeyahay.
I will tell you more	Wax badan ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa
I will not talk about it	Ka hadli maayo
He is clearly not in prison	Waxa cad in aan xabsiga ku jirin
I did not think there was anyone like me	Uma malaynayn in uu jiro qof aniga ila mid ah
I really wanted to	Runtii waan rabay
I want to see you again.	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale arko.
I did everything right	Wax walba si sax ah ayaan u sameeyay
It looks so good	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan
It would be nice to know what happened to him.	In la ogaado waxa ku dhacay way fiicnaan lahayd.
I don't want it any other way.	Si kale uma rabo.
I will do the latter today	Waxaan samayn doonaa tan dambe maanta
Everything is still.	Wax walba waa weli.
That's it.	Waa tan.
It was very busy.	Aad bay mashquul u ahayd.
You, not me.	Adiga, aniga maaha.
I know what you need.	Waan ogahay waxaad u baahan tahay.
I can't believe he's gone	Ma rumaysan karo inuu baxay
This was a lot of unknown.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan oo aan la garanayn.
Give people time.	Dadka waqti sii.
I didn't know any money.	Wax lacag ah kama aan ogayn.
I heard you say so and so on.	Waxaan maqlay inaad sidaas iyo wax la mid ah leedahay.
I just want to be with you	Waxaan rabaa oo kaliya inaan kula joogo
I just love it !.	Kaliya waan jeclahay!.
There is an unknown man.	Nin aan la garanayn baa jira.
You would be.	Waxaad noqon lahayd.
I looked around the room for nothing	Qolka oo dhan ayaan ku eegay waxba
I had to get a job, fast	Waxaan u lahaa in aan shaqo helo, oo degdeg ah
Great one.	Mid weyn.
I am happy to do that	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan taas sameeyo
I could not see what was so bad	Ma arki karin waxa aad u xun
I will still be here	Weli halkaan ayaan joogi doonaa
He looked good.	Wuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I went out.	Waan la baxay.
There was something else, something that did not exist before.	Wax kale ayaa jiray, wax aan hore u jirin.
Give it a few years.	Sii dhowr sano.
But it is better to do this.	Laakiin way fiican tahay in tan la sameeyo.
I had no money for food.	Wax lacag ah cunto uma haysan.
I couldn’t imagine how.	Ma u malayn karin sida.
That is what you are.	Taasi waa waxa aad tahay.
I will surely see him.	Hubaal waan arki doonaa isaga.
I have to love to be what you love	Waa inaan jeclahay inaan noqdo waxaad jeceshahay
This is really a lie.	Runtii tani waa been.
That is a terrible place to be.	Taasi waa meel aad u xun in la joogo.
I was not there.	Aniga ma jirin.
It will definitely be great.	Dhab ahaantii waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
I think that will do me a bit.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi i qaban doonto xoogaa.
I thought you had	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad leedahay
But there is not much.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax badan.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto taas.
It certainly is.	Waxaa hubaal ah.
I will keep you here	halkaan ayaan ku haysan doonaa
I did not understand at first	Maan fahmin markii hore
You can help.	Waad ku caawin kartaa.
He decided to stay.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu sii joogo.
I want her to know.	Waxaan rabaa inay ogaato.
I think she likes the way things are	Waxaan filayaa inay sida ay wax yihiin u jeceshahay
I think they are.	Waxaan filayaa inay yihiin.
You can tell the truth.	Run baad sheegi kartaa.
I have nothing to say.	Wax aan ka sheego ma hayo.
He is a busy man.	Waa nin mashquul ah.
He wants to be like you.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu kula mid noqdo.
He wants to go.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu tago.
I thought it was too much	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u badan tahay
It is probably too early to talk about what comes next.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay goor hore in laga hadlo waxa soo socda.
I can get that.	Waan heli karaa taas.
She can't leave.	Ma bixi karto.
I would give everything they include	Waxaan siin lahaa wax kasta oo ay ku jiraan
He didn't like that.	Ma uu jeclayn taas.
He knew it would be a long day.	Wuu ogaa inay maalin dheer noqon doonto.
I did not want to see anyone	Ma rabin inaan cidna arko
I did not think that was true	Uma malaynayn in taasi run tahay
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
This should not take long.	Tani waa inaysan qaadan waqti dheer.
No one could leave.	Qofna ma bixi karin.
I will get back to you soon	mar dhow ayaan kuu soo noqon doonaa
I knew you would come	Waan ogaa inaad iman doonto
I need to pick it up	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan soo qaado
She felt beautiful.	Waxay dareemay qurux.
Obviously, it is not.	Sida cad, ma aha.
I still haven't said anything to him	Wali waxba uma odhan isaga
She could not.	Way awoodi wayday.
The former is the one I love.	Kan hore waa kan aan jeclahay.
To make money.	Si aad lacag u samayso.
That is not a good thing.	Taasi wax wanaagsan maaha.
I really had no work there	Runtii wax shaqo ah kuma aan lahayn halkaas
There was still a lot of time.	Weli wakhti badan ayaa jiray.
We are like everyone else.	Waxaan la mid nahay dadka kale.
I wish he had something	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu wax haysto
It was here, very close.	Waxay ahayd halkan, oo aad u dhow.
I do not want to, I can not be	Ma rabo, ma noqon karo
A little weird, but nice	Wax yar oo yaab leh, laakiin fiican
He was big enough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid weyn oo ku filan.
No one can say better	Qofna wax ka fiican kama odhan karo
I pretended.	Waan iska dhigay.
I know this is hard to talk about	Waan ogahay in tani ay adag tahay in laga hadlo
Like, you just have to.	Sida, kaliya waa inaad.
I should not have come back here	Ma ahayn inaan halkan ku soo noqdo
To your liking.	Si aad rabto.
I think that will be the worst thing you will ever get	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi noqon doonto waxa ugu xun ee aad heli doonto
At the moment it is correct.	Marka la joogo waa sax.
But, as you know, this cannot be.	Laakiin, sida aad ogtahay, tani ma noqon karto.
I probably have enough	Waxay u badan tahay inaan haysto wax ku filan
I know you have a friend	Waan ogahay inaad saaxiib leedahay
I looked everywhere but could not see anything	Meel walba waan eegay laakiin waxba ma aan arki karin
I think it was	Waxaan filayaa in uu sidaas ahaa
Something bad.	Wax xun.
I really need to talk to him	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga
This is what we do.	Tani waa waxa aan samayno.
I did not know who he was	Maan garanayn cidda uu yahay
Make an appointment for whatever you want	U ballan waxaad doonto
This is difficult.	Tani waa adag tahay.
That is the only reason someone wants to talk to me.	Taasi waa sababta kaliya ee qof doonayo inuu ila hadlo.
I heard something good	Wax wanaagsan ayaan maqlay
I do it now	hadda waan sameeyaa
A little money.	Lacag yar.
It's great.	Waa wax weyn.
I hope that is correct.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi sax tahay.
I will not discuss this anymore	Hadda ka dib kama hadli doono arrintan
Someone had to be there.	Qof ayaa ahaa inuu halkaas joogo.
I will be fine at home.	Waxaan ku fiicnaan doonaa guriga.
I have to know what she wants	Waa inaan ogaado waxay rabto
He wanted to talk now.	Wuxuu rabay inuu hadda hadlo.
But she knew he was there.	Laakiin way ogaatay inuu halkaas ku jiro.
I got this today	kan maanta ayaan helay
I am so sorry for all.	Aad baan uga xumahay dhammaan.
A man who is nothing like a man	Nin aan waxba nin la mid ahayn
The former is new.	Kan hore waa cusub yahay.
So don't be.	Sidaas ha u noqon.
I will do it tomorrow	Waxaan sameyn doonaa berri
I went to another time	Waxaan aaday waqti kale
This cannot be said, he said.	Tan lama sheegi karo, ayuu yidhi.
I told her it was really quick	Waxaan u sheegay inay runtii degdeg tahay
And not here.	Oo halkan maaha.
I had things to work on	Waxaan lahaa waxyaabo aan ku shaqeeyo
Like so much.	Sida wax badan.
It does not work.	Ma shaqeeyo.
I just told him how to do it	Kaliya waxaan u sheegay sida loo sameeyo
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
Maybe he left.	Malaha wuu baxay.
If you do not like it, do not like it.	Haddii aadan ka helin, ma jecli.
I hope there is nothing wrong with this	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan waxba ka jirin arrintan
They are probably good at that.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ku fiican yihiin taas.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
I wonder if we are the same thing	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aan nahay wax isku mid ah
He left.	Wuu baxay.
You love it.	Waad jeceshahay.
I wanted to see the place.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko meesha.
I should not have done it for you	Ma ahayn inaan kuu sameeyo
Bad living things.	Wax nool oo xun.
I quickly withdrew	Degdeg baan uga noqday
What he was and what he did.	Waxa uu ahaa iyo waxa uu sameeyay.
I do not know why you did what you did	Maan garanayn sababta aad u samaysay waxaad samaysay
I really hope you will too	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto
He didn't have to, but he did.	Ma ahayn inuu sameeyo, laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I do not have much time.	Waqti badan ma hayo.
I am not so difficult	Anigu sidaas uma adag
I hope you will think so too	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale u malayn doonto
I can't believe it	ma rumaysan karo
I just couldn’t stay home, you know	Kaliya guriga ma joogi karin, waad ogtahay
I knew they might not come back	Waan ogaa in laga yaabo inaysan mar dambe soo noqon
This is probably true.	Tani malaha waa run.
I really did not want to be here	Runtii ma rabin inaan halkaan joogo
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida uu yahay.
But really, what else can he say.	Laakiin run ahaantii, maxaa kale oo uu odhan karaa.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
Not a bad time.	Waqti xun ma aha.
I have friends	Waxaan ku leeyahay saaxiibo
I pulled it out	Waan kala soo baxay
At work.	Shaqada.
I love something new, fresh and exciting	Waxaan jeclahay wax cusub, cusub oo xiiso leh
I have to do this	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa
I know where he is	Waan ogahay meesha uu joogo
They will be ready for us.	Waxay noo noqon doonaan diyaar.
He could not stop being who he was.	Waa uu joojin waayay inuu yahay qofka uu yahay.
I am not often	Sida badan ma ihi
Runtii is jecel.	Runtii is jecel.
If they like it, they like it.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin, way jecel yihiin.
You just can't go out.	Kaliya ma bixi karto.
I have to see him again	Waa inaan mar kale arko isaga
No one wants it.	Qofna ma rabo.
I will be there for a while	wax yar ayaan halkaas joogi doonaa
I also know, that will be good for me	Sidoo kale waan ogahay, taasi way ii fiicnaan doontaa
There was one and the other and another.	Waxaa jiray mid kale iyo mid kale iyo mid kale.
I don't think you will do much.	Uma maleynayo inaad wax badan qaban doonto.
You didn't talk about it anymore.	Mar dambe ma aadan ka hadlin.
I can't see and I don't have anyone.	Ma arki karo qofna ma haysto.
Where it should have been.	Meesha ay ahayd in ay joogto.
I have never seen him there	Weligay halkaas kuma arag
We just love people.	Waxaan kaliya jecel nahay dadka.
I would love to learn something new from him	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax cusub ka barto isaga
I love you so much, so much	Waan ku jeclahay sidaas, si, aad u badan
I had a great time with you today	Waqti fiican ayaan kula qaatay maanta
It can be great.	Waxa uu noqon karaa mid weyn.
And what a day it was.	Oo maxaa maalin ahayd.
I was not very ready	Aad diyaar uma ahayn
I have never seen anything more beautiful.	Weligay ma arag wax ka qurux badan.
I do not know why this is	Ma garanayo sababta ay tani u tahay
Can someone please help me?	Qof fadlan ma i caawin karaa.
Maybe he left.	Malaha wuu la baxay.
I never have, really.	Weligay ma haysto, run ahaantii.
I'm surprised you're here.	Waxaan la yaabay inaad halkan joogto.
Also, maybe.	Sidoo kale, waa laga yaabaa.
This is probably not true.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaysan run ahayn.
I think he knew something was up	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu ogaa inay wax jiraan
I want to know how it is held	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida loo haysto
I really expect you to go now	Runtii waxaan filayaa inaad hadda aado
I did not know that this existed	Maan ogayn in ay tani jirto
It was as he wanted.	Waxay ahayd sidii uu rabay.
They don’t have to, but they do.	Ma aha inay sameeyaan, laakiin way sameeyaan.
But it is not a good idea.	Laakiin fikrad fiican maaha.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
It's good for me.	Way ii fiican tahay aniga.
It's not free, it just looks like that.	Maaha lacag la'aan, kaliya waxay u egtahay sidaas.
Everyone knows that is true.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa inay taasi run tahay.
But how do I do this?	Laakiin sidee baan tan u sameeyaa?.
There was nothing we could do for the people there.	Ma jirin wax aan u qaban karno dadka halkaas ku nool.
I told him we were even	Waxaan u sheegay inaan xitaa nahay
I think that has	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay leedahay
He could not leave.	Waa uu bixi waayay.
I did not want to be here	Maan rabin inaan halkaan joogo
A lot has come from there	Wax badan baa halkaas ka yimid
I did not know what it was	Ma garanayn waxa uu yahay
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
Very good.	Aad u wanaagsan.
I wonder what happened to him	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ku dhacay
I have done that before	Taas hore ayaan u sameeyay
I spread it.	Waan kala qaaday.
I was not lucky	Nasiib uma helin
I am what you will be	Anigu waxaan ahay waxa aad noqon doonto
Everyone loves me too, he thought.	Qof kastaa wuu i jecel yahay sidoo kale, ayuu u maleeyay.
I am not like him.	Ma ihi isaga oo kale.
I would say a lot.	Wax badan baan odhan lahaa.
I told her it was beautiful, you could have it	Waxaan u sheegay inay qurux badan tahay, waad haysan kartaa
It is a great job.	Waa shaqo aad u weyn.
He knew nothing else.	Wax kale ma uu ogayn.
Not a bad idea.	Maaha fikrad aad u xun.
We probably won't see you for a while	Waxay u badan tahay inaan ku arki doonin in muddo ah
I want to stay	Waxaan rabaa inaan joogo
I will get that much.	Taas aad baan ugu heli doonaa.
I tried to do something	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax sameeyo
Little is expected.	Wax yar ayaa laga filayaa.
I haven't done that in a long time	Taas maan samayn muddo dheer
You will get another chance.	Waxaad heli doontaa fursad kale.
is good for you.	wuu kugu fiican yahay.
I have to do that.	Waa inaan taas sameeyaa.
Tell the person the same way.	U sheeg qofka si la mid ah.
But I'm not sure.	Laakiin taasi ma hubo.
They will not arrest me.	Ima qaban doonaan.
I can get another one	Waxaan heli karaa mid kale
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u wanaagsan.
We can’t be more than friends, we just can’t be.	Ma noqon karno wax ka badan saaxiibo, kaliya ma noqon karno.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
But really.	Laakiin runtii .
But this is not over yet.	Laakiin tani weli ma dhammaan.
I couldn't do anything.	Waxba kama qaban karin.
He will not allow him to do so.	Uma ogolaan doono inuu sidaas sameeyo.
I really looked bad	Runtii waxaan u muuqday mid xun
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I don’t even want to know how bad it is.	Xitaa ma rabo inaan ogaado sida ay u xun tahay.
She doesn't want to do anything to me.	Wax ay igu sameyso ma rabto.
No one at home knows.	Qofna guriga ma garanayo.
Definitely enough for you.	Waa hubaal in kugu filan.
I will never get anything	Weligay waxba ma heli doono
I did not want to leave you	Ma rabin inaan kaa tago
Tell them how big they are.	U sheeg sida ay u weyn yihiin.
Other bad stuff, too.	Waxyaabo kale oo xun, sidoo kale.
No one can find it.	Qofna ma heli karo.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
It is so beautiful there.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay halkaas.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
I have no problem with money.	Wax dhib ah igama haysto lacag.
I did not know he had left, and he had returned	Maan ogayn inuu baxay, oo soo noqday
You know it is.	Waad ogtahay inay tahay.
I think he lives nearby	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku nool yahay meel u dhow
I don't think it will happen.	Uma maleynayo inay dhici doonto.
Maybe he still wants to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli doono.
I think he might even take money from it	Waxaan u malaynayaa in laga yaabo inuu xitaa lacag ka qaado
You have done well.	Wax wanaagsan baad samaysay.
She said he didn't.	Waxay sheegtay in uusan lahayn.
That is not the same.	In aanu isku mid ahayn.
I'm just happy.	Kaliya waan faraxsanahay.
But not everyone went.	Laakiin qof walba ma tagin.
That is what they do.	Taasi waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
It is good for us.	Way noo fiican tahay.
In fact, I did not like it	Runtii, maan jeclayn
I did not say that	Taas uma sheegin
I can always talk about that	Weligay waan ka hadli karaa taas
I just want to stay home	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan guriga joogo
I did not want to leave him	Ma rabin inaan isaga tago
No one wants this	Qofna uma rabo tan
It was time for him.	Waxay ahayd wakhti isaga.
He is very bad in every way.	Aad ayuu uga xun yahay dhan walba.
I am very happy with the job	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay shaqada
I know what happened to you	Waan ogahay waxa kugu dhacay
I looked quickly but saw nothing	Si degdeg ah ayaan wax u eegay laakiin waxba maan arag
I told him this was nonsense	Waxaan u sheegay in tani ay tahay wax aan jirin
Make friends with everyone.	La saaxiib qof walba.
I did not find it so	Anigu sidaas uma helin
Only one person is missing.	Oo kaliya hal qof ayaa waayay.
There is nothing you can do now.	Ma jiraan wax aad hadda qaban karto.
I told them not to do that again.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay mar dambe taas samayn.
I think he talks about it.	Waxaan qabaa inuu ka hadlo.
Not sure he can.	Ma hubo inuu awoodo.
I am, and always is here	Waxaan ahay, iyo had iyo jeer halkan
I don't mind that, it's good for you.	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo taas, adiga ayaa kuu fiican.
I wonder why he came back	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu u soo noqday
I can do anything she can.	Wax kasta oo ay samayn karto waan samayn karaa.
That was a bit difficult.	Taasi waxay ahayd xoogaa adag.
A new and exciting friend	Saaxiib cusub oo xiiso leh
Not good, not great.	Ma aha mid wanaagsan, mid weyn.
tell me.	ii sheeg.
I am happy to have him here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan isaga halkan ku haysto.
I have not been there for a long time	Halkaas maan joogin muddo dheer
I wondered what he did	Waxaan la yaabay waxa uu sameeyay
I could not tell you what he did there	Waxaan kuu sheegi waayay waxa uu halkaas ka sameeyay
I think it is very bad	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u xun tahay
I had to talk to someone	Waxay ahayd inaan qof la hadlo
I really want to know.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado.
After a while he left	Wax yar ka dib wuu baxay
I really wanted to.	run baan rabay.
I didn't get anything back.	Wax dib uma helin.
That's what he wanted to do.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabay inuu sameeyo.
I knew it and it didn't matter	Waan ogaa oo dhib ma lahayn
I really did not want to leave	Runtii ma rabin inaan baxo
I felt that was left out	Waxaan dareemay in taas laga tagay
Not now, not tonight.	Hadda maaha, caawa maaha.
That was a big deal.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax weyn.
I am not one of them now.	Anigu hadda ka mid ma ihi.
I had to help you	Waxay ahayd inaan ku caawiyo
You can not be	Ma noqon kartid
I was not able to do it any other time	Ma awoodin in aan waqti kale sameeyo
I think it is something else	Waxaan qabaa inay tahay wax kale
I just need to see him	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko isaga
It looks very small.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u yar.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Certainly not.	Hubaal ma yeeli doono.
It is always a bad idea.	Had iyo jeer waa fikrad xun.
I just thought that, you know	Kaliya taas ayaan u maleeyay, waad ogtahay
Not now.	Ma jiro hadda.
He lied to you.	Been buu kuu sheegay.
But he did not tell anyone.	Laakiin cidna uma uu sheegin.
But it had to be told.	Laakiin waxay ahayd in la sheego.
I am really happy to be here now	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan hadda halkan joogo
They will certainly do it.	Hubaal way yeeli doonaan.
I wonder if you would take it	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aad qaadan lahayd
But no one is able to leave.	Laakiin qofna ma awoodo inuu baxo.
I love him so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga
Everyone wanted to help.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu caawiyo.
There is nothing we do not know.	Wax aanu garanayn ma jiraan.
Tan ma arag.	Tan ma arag.
I started to see myself	Waxaan bilaabay inaan is arko
I will not give up.	Ka noqon maayo.
I want something big with you	Waxaan kula rabaa wax weyn
It was taken.	Waa la qaatay.
That will be fine.	Taasi way fiicnaan doontaa.
I could not say how much	Ma sheegi karin ilaa inta
I have to know about you.	Waa inaan adiga kaa ogahay.
I know she does.	Waan ogahay inay sameyso.
I really hope you like it	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay
I will catch you, anyway	Waan ku qaban doonaa, si kasta
He said.	Wuxuu yidhi.
But it is not good.	Laakiin mid wanaagsan maaha.
I really wanted to keep it	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan sii hayo
This is how it is done.	Waa sida tan loo sameeyo.
I want to know everything	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ogaado
The door was solid.	Albaabka wuxuu ahaa mid adag.
We can certainly do it here.	Waa hubaal inaan halkan ku samayn karno.
I can be anything.	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta.
Tell them why.	U sheeg sababta.
Maybe I should work with him too	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale la shaqeeyo
I am very happy with this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay kan.
I wanted to be part of it	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo
I should not have told you this	Ma ahayn inaan tan kuu sheego
There is nothing more false.	Ma jiraan wax ka been badan.
I knew it wasn't	Waan ogaa inuusan ahayn
But it is not yet clear	Laakiin weli si cad kuma aadan
I heard you, you know.	Waan ku maqlay, waad ogtahay.
I think they are tough.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay adag yihiin.
I will tell you everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegi doonaa.
It was a few years.	Waxay ahayd dhowr sano.
But she did not give up.	Laakiin ma aysan siin.
Not yet.	Wali ma jiraan.
I should have expected this	Waxay ahayd inaan tan filan lahaa
But now he can find more in the room, he says.	Laakiin hadda wax badan ayuu qolka ka heli karaa, ayuu yidhi.
I am very sorry about that	Aad iyo aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
Not for long.	Ma aha muddo dheer.
I just do not know.	Kaliya ma garanayo.
I really have to go one day.	Runtii waa inaan aado hal maalin.
I really can't say why.	Run ahaantii ma sheegi karo sababta.
Not even a bit.	Xitaa xoogaa ma aha.
It looks bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun.
I can't find much.	Wax badan kama heli karo.
Not much now.	Ma badna hadda.
I would like you to stay	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad joogto
It can be.	Wuxuu noqon karaa.
There is nothing surprising.	Wax la yaab leh ma jiraan.
I have nothing to tell you	Wax aan kuu sheego ma hayo
I still doubt you will believe me	Weli waxaan ka shakisanahay inaad i rumaysan doonto
He must have seen me like that.	Waa inuu sidaas oo kale igu arkay.
I did not know that this would come	Maan ogayn inay tani iman doonto
He can do whatever he wants.	Waxa uu doono wuu samayn karaa.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
But he knows something.	Laakiin wuu garanayaa wax.
I can't find him	Ma ka heli karo isaga
I need to talk to you in person	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof ahaan kula hadlo
Not now.	Hadda ma jirto.
I can't do this anymore	Tan hadda ka dib ma qaban karo
he is good at it.	wuu ku fiican yahay.
I think it's a good idea.	Waxaan qabaa inay fikrad fiican tahay.
You will be fine	Waad fiicnaan doontaa
I knew they would not hurt me	Waan ogaa in aanay waxba i yeeli doonin
I still can't say that	Taas weli uma sheegi karo
One has little to do with the other.	Mid wax yar ayuu kan kale la leeyahay.
It can be more than one.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax ka badan hal.
I hope you found out how much everyone loves you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ogaatay sida qof kastaa kuu jecel yahay
I will go there	halkaas ayaan tagi doonaa
Maybe he had.	Malaha wuu lahaa.
I have seen this before	Tan hore ayaan u arkay
You can't give me much.	Wax badan igama siin kartid.
I had to find out how it is.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado sida uu yahay.
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
A tall man came in	Nin dheer baa soo galay
I can only do what I can	Waxa aan awoodo oo kaliya ayaan samayn karaa
That is very difficult.	Taasi aad bay u adag tahay.
I am nothing	Anigu waxba ma ihi
I'm not sure	Waxba ma hubo
I had to do it for you	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu sameeyo
I love having it there	Waan jeclahay inaan halkaas ku haysto
Everyone is here.	Qof walba waa halkan.
He came to her.	Wuu u yimid.
I don't want her in jail.	Ma doonayo in ay xabsiga ku jirto.
I had no intention of leaving	Waxba ma rabin inaan halkaas ka tago
Very good, he said.	Aad u fiican, ayuu yidhi.
I wondered how that would be	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay taasi noqon doonto
I tried it once.	Waxaan isku dayay hal mar.
He really liked that.	Runtii taas wuu ka helay.
I thought everyone knew.	Waxaan u maleeyay in qof walba ogyahay.
There is nothing but me.	Wax aan aniga ahayn ma jiro.
He knew how to do it.	Wuu ogaa sida loo sameeyo.
To do.	In la sameeyo.
I hope you will be fine	Waxaan filayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto
He saw things that others could not.	Wuxuu arkay waxyaabo aysan dadka kale awoodin.
They are more than we can imagine.	Way ka badan yihiin inta aan malayn karno.
Again and again	Mar iyo mar kale
He was there even more than me.	Waxa uu joogay xitaa in ka badan aniga.
I could not take it	Waan u qaadan waayay
I need time to find out	Waxaan u baahanahay waqti aan ku ogaado
Maybe he still did.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli sameeyay.
I know you can't do that	Waan ogahay inaadan taas samayn karin
I was there long enough	Waxaan joogay waqti igu filan
I heard it all through the door	Waxaan ka maqlay dhammaan albaabka
I can tell everything and everything	Wax walba iyo wax walba waan u sheegi karaa
I was really impressed	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay
I could no longer stay	Mar dambe ma aan joogi karin
neither.	ma sidoo kale.
There is nothing new there	Ma jiraan wax ku cusub halkaas
I know it's hard for you	Waan ogahay inay kugu adag tahay
He did not tell them to do so	Uma sheegin inay sidaas sameeyaan
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxaan sameeyo.
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
I have heard it several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan maqlay
I need to be with him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la joogo
They probably won't, but still.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan yeeli doonin, laakiin weli.
I thought it was really good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii aad u fiican tahay
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
Now, it was time.	Hadda, waxay ahayd wakhti.
But that is not even the case.	Laakiin taasi xitaa maaha.
You can't do this long enough.	Tan ma samayn kartid wakhti kugu filan.
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u wanaagsan.
Maybe he too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
I didn't want that.	Maan rabin taas.
She should have known that.	Waxay ahayd inay taas ogaato.
This was unsuccessful	Tani waxay ahayd mid aan lagu guulaysan
There is nothing else going on.	Wax kale oo socda ma jiraan.
I did not know they existed	Maan ogayn inay jiraan
He thought so.	Wuu mooday taas.
I was surprised she was like him	Waxaan la yaabay inay isaga la mid tahay
The door is still locked.	Albaabka wali waa la hayaa.
I have no idea what it might be	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay noqon karto
But this will do the job.	Laakiin tani waxay qaban doontaa shaqada.
Like tomorrow it would be better.	Sida berrito way fiicnaan lahayd.
I have nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo aan aado ma jirto.
It's great, but I don't know it better.	Waa weyn yahay, laakiin si ka sii fiican uma garanayo.
I will be very good	Aad baan u fiicnaan doonaa
Most of the time I had a lot	Inta badan waxaan lahaa wax badan
Something similar to him.	Wax la mid ah isaga.
I have a lot to say about it	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan ka sheego
He was asked.	Waxa la waydiiyay.
But no one, really.	Laakiin qofna ma jirin, runtii.
Everyone is harder.	Qof kasta wuu ka adag yahay.
I really like him	Runtii aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga
I had to leave	Waxay ahayd inaan baxo
I felt loved.	Waxaan dareemay in la jecel yahay.
I was sure.	Waxaan ahaa wax la hubo.
But this can happen	Laakiin tani way dhici kartaa
You are his favorite.	Waxaad tahay uu jecel yahay.
He thought he could do better.	Wuxuu mooday inuu wax ka wanaagsan samayn karo.
I clearly wanted to	Waxaan si cad u rabay
But it was a lot.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax badan.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
He can still stay.	Weli wuu joogi karaa.
I know you will not find a better man	Waan ogahay inaadan heli doonin nin ka wanaagsan
If he can do that, he can do anything.	Haddii uu taas samayn karo, wax kasta wuu samayn karaa.
I thought.	waan ku mooday .
None of us.	Mid naga mid ma aha.
He should not have been told.	Ma ahayn in loo sheego.
I didn't get that.	Ma helin taas.
I can't see who she is.	Ma arki karo cidda ay tahay.
There was no truth.	Wax run ah ma jirin.
I can stay for a while	xoogaa waan joogi karaa
She couldn't see anything.	Waxba way arki wayday.
It's more complicated than that.	Way ka dhib badan tahay taas.
I thought he would.	Waxaan mooday inuu yeeli doono.
Found.	La helay.
I can't talk	Kama hadli karo
I don't want to have a place.	Ma rabo in aan meel ku haysto.
Indeed, this is what has been achieved.	Runtii, tani waa waxa la helay.
This can’t be pretty.	Tani ma noqon karto mid qurux badan.
I can't believe everything that happened	Waxa dhacay oo dhan ma rumaysan karo
He gave me money.	Lacag ayuu i siiyay.
Said a great man	Nin weyn bay tidhi
But not me.	Laakiin aniga maaha.
I think he loves me	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu i jecel yahay
I should have known, really	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado, run ahaantii
I really enjoyed this	Runtii tan aad ayaan uga helay
He would love to do it again.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu mar kale sameeyo.
Tell them why.	U sheeg sababta.
I heard you don't want me	Waxaan maqlay inaadan i rabin
I think everyone did	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba sameeyay
It is not the same.	Ma aha wax la mid ah.
You may be happy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ku faraxsan tahay.
I did it hard a few years ago	Si adag ayaan u sameeyay dhowr sano ka hor
Something big is coming.	Wax weyn ayaa soo socda.
Everyone thinks this is.	Qof kastaa wuxuu qabaa in tani ay tahay.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay tan.
It will not do anything yet.	Wali waxba ma qaban doono.
I will deal with it clearly	si cad ayaan wax uga qaban doonaa
I had time	Waxaan ku lahaa waqti
Not as much as you would like.	Ma aha inta la rabo.
But it will not happen.	Laakiin ma dhici doonto.
I can clearly see.	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa.
I just wanted to be	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan noqdo
I can't leave him now	Hadda kama tagi karo isaga
First, that is for sure	Marka hore, taasi waa hubaal
I have no idea what happened	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa dhacay
You will do the same.	Waxaad samayn doontaa wax la mid ah.
It is nowhere near.	Meel u dhow ma jirto.
I have never seen one.	Weligay mid maan arag.
I started hard	Waxaan ku bilaabay si adag
He knew it would not happen.	Wuu ogaa in aanay dhici doonin.
I didn’t think he felt for me	Uma malaynayn inuu i dareemay
I don't think they need it	Uma maleynayo inay u baahan yihiin
I still can't find the time to be here	Wali ma heli karo waqti aan halkan ku joogo
I would not have otherwise	Si kale uma haysan lahaa
He tried to say something.	Waxa uu isku dayay in uu wax sheego.
It's a terrible thing.	Waa wax aad u xun.
She seems to want to.	Waxay u egtahay inay rabto.
I will not be stopped	La ii joojin maayo
I don't want to do anything with it	Ma doonayo inaan wax ku sameeyo
I don’t get it, either.	Anigu ma helo, sidoo kale.
We will have a good time with this.	Waqti fiican ayaan la qaadan doonaa kan.
Do not separate.	Ha kala tagin.
I had to leave here	Waxay ahayd inaan halkan ka baxo
I liked it, but I didn't like it	Waan ka helay, laakiin ma jeclayn
You do not need to stay longer	Uma baahnid inaan sii joogo waqti dheer
I think that's amazing	Waxay ila tahay taasi waa yaab
You can't lie.	Been uma sheegi karto.
Now less than before.	Hadda in ka yar sidii hore.
Maybe I can get one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan helo mid.
I think he really tried to be a good guy	Waxaan filayaa inuu runtii isku dayay inuu noqdo nin wanaagsan
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
But it did not leave me.	Laakiin aniga igama tagin.
He is back.	Wuu soo noqday.
He saw them all.	Wuu wada arkay.
I knew there was one, but it was not a place	Waan ogaa inuu mid jiro, laakiin ma ahayn meel
That is why this is not the case.	Taasi waa sababta aysan taasi jirin.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
That person was me.	Taasi qof ayaa aniga ahaa.
No one knows what to do.	Qofna ma garanayo wax la sameeyo.
I just want someone to talk to	Kaliya waxaan rabaa qof aan la hadlo
But he did something.	Laakiin wax buu sameeyay.
It just won't do.	Kaliya ma yeeli doono.
He would love to do it.	Waxa uu jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo.
I was in a bad place	meel xun ayaan joogay
This can be anything you want.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I did not think you would come alone	Uma malaynayn inaad keligaa iman doonto
I really could not tell.	Dhab ahaan uma sheegi karin.
This is why he will succeed.	Tani waa sababta uu u guulaysan doono.
But there is nothing wrong with that, of course.	Laakiin wax xun kuma jiraan, hubaal.
I hear	Waan maqlay
This does not stop me.	Tani ima joojin.
I took it for you	Waan kuu qaatay
But this was for sure.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd hubaal.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
But it really is not.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii ma aha.
Most likely.	Inta badan waa laga yaabaa.
I would like to know.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado.
I did not do enough	Wax igu filan maan qaban
I wanted him to come.	Waxaan rabay inuu yimaado.
I can do something about it	Waan wax ka qaban karaa
Everyone knows each other.	Qof walba waa is yaqaan.
But there was nothing.	Laakiin waxba kuma jirin.
I can not take the latter	Tan dambe ma qaadan karo
I just tried to help a friend	Waxaan isku dayay kaliya inaan caawiyo saaxiib
Nor is anyone else.	Sidoo kale ma jiro qof kale.
Everyone has a different opinion.	Qof kastaa fikrad kale ayuu ka qabaa.
I still couldn't do that	Taas weli ma aan samayn karin
As everyone else does.	Sida qof kasta oo kale sameeyo.
I will love this one.	Waan jeclaan doonaa kan.
She did not leave me.	Way iga tagi weyday.
I can be the same after a long time	Waxaan noqon karaa si la mid ah ka dib markii muddo dheer
I didn't find anything.	Waxba kama helin.
I do not know who he was	Ma garanayo qofka uu ahaa
It did not come from me.	Aniga igama iman.
I have it to this day	waan hayaa ilaa maanta
He lives for that.	Taas ayuu u nool yahay.
I have not taken it yet	Wali maan qaadan
I can't find anything	Wax ma heli karo
I would do that tomorrow	Waxaan samayn lahaa taas berrito
I wanted to leave tonight	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo caawa
It is always good.	Had iyo jeer way fiican tahay.
He would not say.	Ma uu odhan lahaa.
I am so glad I did not join	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaanan ka mid noqon
You can hardly say anything.	Si dhib ah ayaad wax u odhan kartaa.
I could not take anything.	Waxba maan qaadan karin.
There is no place like home, 'and you can stay there.	Ma jirto meel guriga la mid ah,' oo waad joogi kartaa halkaas.
But you can have everything.	Laakiin wax walba waad haysan kartaa.
I did not want to eat	Maan rabin inaan cuno
But how are you just.	Laakiin sidee baad u tahay kaliya.
Not much to say.	Ma aha in wax badan la sheego.
I just can't help it	Kaliya ma caawin karo
I say, later.	Waxaan leeyahay, mar dambe.
I can hardly say.	Si dhib ah ayaan u odhan karaa.
He knew.	Wuu ogaa.
I think he was a good man.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ahaa nin wanaagsan.
And it is not new.	Oo maaha mid cusub.
I just need to do this	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan sameeyo
I will do this	tan ayaan samayn doonaa
But we really don’t.	Laakiin runtii ma samayno.
There was no way to find out.	Ma jirin si loo ogaado.
I thought you were here.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad halkaan joogto.
We can only see us as we are now	Waxaan kaliya noo arki karaa sida aan hadda nahay
I could not stay with him	Maan sii joogi karin isaga
Let them do it.	Ha sameeyaan.
I am very happy to see you	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
I came out, no problem	Waan ka soo baxay, dhib la'aan
I think you like what you do	Waxaan filayaa inaad jeceshahay waxaad samaynayso
I think we can do it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan sameyn karno
I expect to do the same here	Waxaan filayaa inaan sidaas oo kale ku sameeyo halkan
That is not wise.	Taasi caqli maaha.
And they did not.	Oo ma ay haysan.
I just couldn't go out	Kaliya ma bixi karin
I will be smarter.	Waxaan noqon doonaa caqli badan.
I did not have that	Maan haysan taas
He would be right.	Sax buu ahaan lahaa.
I would be much more than this	Waxaan noqon lahaa wax aad uga badan tan
I do not see anything wrong	Ma arko wax xun
As she did.	Sidii ay samaysay.
I do not know what happened to him	Ma aha inaan ogaado waxa ku dhacay
I need to work on where he went.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo meesha uu aaday.
I can't get that back	Taas dib uma heli karo
Not only that.	Ma aha ka kaliya.
Now I am afraid of him.	Hadda isaga ayaan uga baqayaa.
Everyone knows everyone.	Qof walba waa yaqaan qof walba.
I do not feel anything like that	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma dareemayo
She should have known they would be.	Waxay ahayd inay ogaato inay noqon doonaan.
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
Otherwise I will not do it now	Si kale hadda ma yeeli doono
But I need him.	Laakiin waan u baahanahay isaga.
But you don't have to tell anyone.	Laakiin ma aha inaad qofna u sheegto.
I wanted the worst	Waxaan rabay sida ugu xun
I will never make an appointment	Weligay ballan ma samayn doono
I hope you can help me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
This is not an emergency.	Tani ma aha mid degdeg ah.
I think so	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas tahay
I wanted what was best for everyone	Waxaan rabay waxa qof walba u wanaagsan
I should not have picked it up	Ma ahayn inaan soo qaado
You can go anywhere you want.	Waxaad tagi kartaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
You can find it here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
I should not have known that	Ma ahayn inaan taas ogaado
I may be picked up early	Waxa laga yaabaa in goor hore la iga qaado
Nothing.	Wax aanu ku jirin.
What is this ?.	Waa maxay waxaan?.
A place that feels at home.	Meel uu dareemayo guriga.
There was no time for anything beautiful.	Ma jirin waqti wax qurux badan.
It felt a little too good.	Waxa la dareemay in yar oo aad u wanaagsan.
Luckily, for sure.	Nasiib, hubaal.
I really did not want her to know that	Runtii ma aanan rabin inay taas ogaato
Not one, much.	Mid ma aha, badan.
I just know you don’t talk about me much.	Waxaan ogahay oo kaliya inaadan iga hadlin wax badan.
I would give everything they include	Waxaan siin lahaa wax kasta oo ay ku jiraan
He is a very smart man.	Waa nin caqli badan.
You know, there are a lot of things.	Waad ogtahay, waxaa jira waxyaabo badan.
I am a very good person.	Waxaan ahay qof aad u fiican.
I should have seen the next one	Waxay ahayd inaan arko kan soo socda
I have nothing.	waxba ma hayo.
Something bad was going to happen now.	Wax xun ayaa dhici lahaa hadda.
I told you that, already.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegay, mar hore.
I wanted to be with you badly	Waxaan rabay inaan kula joogo si xun
I still do that now.	Weli taas hadda waan sameeyaa.
I have not seen what it is	Maan arag waxa ay tahay
I did not leave.	Maan bixi jirin.
There was no time.	Waqti ma jirin.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga.
He would see it everywhere.	Meel walba wuu arki lahaa.
I never lie, this is not the case.	Weligay been ma sheego, ma aha arrintan.
I went again.	Mar kale ayaan aaday.
We are made forever.	Waa nala dhigay weligay.
I tried	waan isku dayay
There are so many good things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aad u wanaagsan oo aad u badan.
There is no food.	Ma jirto wax cunto ah.
I hope she will do the same for you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas oo kale kuu samayn doonto
I did not want to come out again	Ma rabin inaan mar dambe soo baxo
I could not leave immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan meesha uga bixi waayay
I thought there was	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay jirto
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
I can't stop seeing	Ma joojin karo inaan arko
I thought that was interesting	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay tahay mid xiiso leh
It was so much more.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
I can't find everything	Wax walba ma heli karo
So, there may be something interesting about them.	Marka, waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax xiiso leh oo ka mid ah.
Meals will also be provided.	Cunto sidoo kale waa la bixin doonaa.
He does, and so on.	Wuu sameeyaa, iyo sida.
It must have been before.	Waa inay hore u ahayd.
I thought there were things she needed to say.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay jiraan waxyaabo ay u baahan tahay inay sheegto.
I love good fun.	Waxaan jeclahay xiiso wanaagsan.
I could not find anything to do with him	Maan helin wax aan ku sameeyo isaga
I am very skeptical	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay
I know what he needs	Waan ogahay waxa uu u baahan yahay
Well, everything is fine.	Fiican, wax walba waa wanaagsan yihiin.
I really have no idea how long that will be	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto inta ay taasi ahaan doonto
I have nothing to say.	Ma hayo wax aan sheego.
we are ready	diyaar ayaan nahay
Lots of things to do.	Waxyaabo badan oo la sameeyo.
There is just so much.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo kaliya.
Let me pick you up.	Aan ku soo qaado.
I had to find out what happened and why	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa dhacay iyo sababta
I wonder what they are	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxay yihiin
There is so much here.	Wax badan ayaa jira halkan.
But it is not, really.	Laakiin maaha, runtii.
I can come and see	Waan iman karaa oo waan arki karaa
I just can't help it.	Kaliya ma caawin karo.
You are very good.	Aad baad u fiican tahay.
I had a good time too	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay sidoo kale
It can't be real.	Ma noqon karo dhab.
It is difficult for him to do so.	Way adag tahay inuu sidaas sameeyo.
The same is found here.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa laga helay halkan.
I got it from someone else	Waxaan ka helay qof kale
Now it was true.	Hadda waxay ahayd run.
I'm not doing anything wrong	Ma samaynayo wax xun oo dhan
You just can't go out.	Ma bixi kartid oo kaliya.
I didn't think it would really go away	Uma malaynayn inay dhab ahaan tagi doonto
That's fine with me.	Taasi waa aniga ila fiican.
I will find a place	meel baan ku heli doonaa
It sounds like a great idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad weyn.
Several male friends reported similar incidents	Dhowr nin oo saaxiibo ah ayaa soo sheegay waxyaabo la mid ah
I wanted to eat	Waxaan rabay inaan cuno
I really didn't like that	Runtii taas maan jeclayn
It was a good thing to see	Waxay ahayd wax fiican in la arko
I was not the only one who felt that way.	Anigu ma ahayn ka kaliya ee sidaas dareemay.
I knew everyone else was right	Waan ogaa in qof kasta oo kale uu sax ahaa
A good man finds a bad place	Nin wanaagsan baa meel xun helay
I do not know, right.	Ma garanayo, sax.
He is a tough guy.	Waa nin adag.
It is difficult but it can be done.	Way adag tahay laakiin waa la samayn karaa.
He will tell me what to do.	Wuxuu ii sheegi doonaa waxaan sameeyo.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I should not have said anything	Ma ahayn inaan wax u sheego
I just can't take it anymore	Kaliya ma qaadan karo mar dambe
I wondered what had happened	Waxaan la yaabay maxaa dhacay
If any.	Haddii ay jiraan.
Very beautiful and smart.	Aad u qurux badan oo caqli badan.
That is not how it is.	Taasi maaha sida ay tahay.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah maaha.
Maybe this is true.	Malaha tani waa run.
I felt rejected and left for a long time	Waxa aan dareemay in la i diiday oo aan ka tagay wakhti badan
Someone else came in	Qof kale ayaa soo galay
But there was something else first.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jiray marka hore.
I have no idea what happened now	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa hadda dhacay
Maybe it was true.	Malaha run bay ahayd.
I should not have said	Ma ahayn inaan sheego
I thought you liked it	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeceshahay
I was lucky	Waxaan ahaa mid nasiib badan
I'm surprised you didn't	Waxaan la yaabay inaadan samayn
It never came out again.	Mar dambe ma soo bixin.
I know you want to help	Waan ogahay inaad rabto inaad caawiso
I was not given a chance	Fursad ma siin
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
I know you do.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyso.
I knew it would be great.	Waan ogaa inay wax weyn noqon doonto.
I should not have gone home	Ma ahayn inaan guriga aado
I thought he was good there	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku fiican yahay halkaas
I should not have been surprised.	Ma ahayn inaan la yaabanahay.
This is for sure.	Tani waa hubaal.
I couldn't believe she really wanted me	Ma rumaysan karin inay runtii i rabto
I can't leave him now.	Hadda kama tagi karo isaga.
It should be noted.	Waa in la ogaado.
It was something to say.	Waxay ahayd wax la sheego.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I do not think so.	Uma maleynayo sidaas.
It will take time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
I like	waan jeclahay
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yaab leh.
I certainly have never had a friend at home	Hubaal weligay saaxiib guriga maan helin
I was really determined.	Runtii aad baan u go'aansaday.
I took what he told me to take	Waxaan qaatay wuxuu igu yidhi qaado
Not sure where to leave here.	Ma hubo meesha aan ka tago halkan.
I hope he comes.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu iman doono.
Really, really, I am	Runtii, runtii, waxaan ahay
I hope you do.	Waxaan filayaa inaad sameyso.
I tried to go	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u tago
Right there.	Isla halkaas.
I need something big	Waxaan u baahanahay wax weyn
But what was done was done.	Laakiin waxa la sameeyay waa la sameeyay.
Probably very good.	Malaha aad u fiican.
But it is correct.	Laakiin waa sax.
I knew this would probably take time	Waxaan ogaa in tani ay u badan tahay inay qaadan doonto waqti
It would be nice to do that.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in taas la sameeyo.
Very, very long	Aad iyo aad u dheer
I can't do anything else.	Wax kale ma samayn karo tan.
I told the truth.	Run baan ii sheegay.
I found it very bad	Waxa aan u arkay mid aad u xun
Obviously, this is not true.	Sida iska cad, tani run maaha.
I am very happy to be at home.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan guriga joogo.
I always wanted to do other things	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo waxyaabo kale
He must be with us.	Waa inuu nala joogaa.
But something else will come out.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa soo bixi doona.
I should never have done that	Ma ahayn inaan weligay taas samayn
No one has seen it yet.	Qofna weli ma arag.
I can barely see now	Si dhib ah ayaan hadda wax u arki karaa
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
Glad I did.	Ku faraxsanahay inaan sameeyo.
I have one	mid baan leeyahay
I was surprised she did.	Waxaan la yaabay inay samaysay.
I am ready for it	diyaar ayaan u ahay
You know it's true.	Waad ogtahay inay run tahay.
She realized he had nowhere to go.	Waxay ogaatay inuusan lahayn meel uu aado.
Three were not found.	Saddex waa la heli waayay.
Now that was interesting.	Hadda taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
I know very little about you.	Wax yar ayaan kaa ogahay.
you think.	waxaad u malaynaysaa.
It is very real someone.	Aad bay u dhab tahay qof.
I really need to talk to you	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
I did not want to talk to anyone	Ma rabin inaan cidna la hadlo
I really don't know why.	Runtii ma garanayo sababta.
It will happen when desired.	Waxay dhici doontaa marka la doonayo.
He felt that this was what he needed.	Waxa uu dareemay in tani ay tahay waxa uu u baahan yahay.
I can take something from the living room now	Qolka dheer ayaan hadda wax ka sii qaadan karaa
It does not look very good.	Uma eka mid aad u wanaagsan.
I told her it was really great	Waxaan u sheegay inay runtii ahayd wax weyn
He was very good at once, for sure.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u wanaagsan hal mar, hubaal.
I think we can do more and better.	Waxaan filayaa in aan wax badan iyo si ka wanaagsan wax u qaban karno.
I know it looks amazing	Waan ogahay in ay u egtahay wax yaab leh
I tried to find you	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ku helo
I was not ready to do that	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan taas sameeyo
I would love to see something like this	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko tan oo kale
I know you will love it	Waan ogahay inaad aad u jeclaan doonto
I think they will.	Waxaan filayaa inay yeeli doonaan.
I really liked him	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga
I can't speak right now.	Ma hadli karo hadda.
I stayed home a lot.	In badan ayaan guriga joogay.
It was done.	Waxaa lagu sameeyay.
The cause is very well known.	Sababta ayaa ah mid aad loo yaqaan.
I think that is the only thing we can do now	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno hadda
It was all over me.	Waxay ahayd aniga oo dhan.
I did not think this would happen	Uma malaynayn in tani dhici doonto
I hope this helps someone.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay caawiso qof.
I will do what you want	Waxaan samayn doonaa waxaad rabto
A little money	Lacag yar
I love working on it	Waan jeclahay in aan ka shaqeeyo
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
Much more.	Wax badan oo kale.
I decided not to let it	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan u ogolaan
I have to do it.	waa inaan sameeyaa .
I wish that was not so, but it is	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in taasi aysan ahayn sidaas, laakiin waa
I was here wherever it was	Waxaan ahaa halkan meel kasta oo ay ahayd
I have several.	Waxaan leeyahay dhowr ka mid ah.
A man she had never met came out	Nin aanay hore u arag ayaa soo baxay
You can even be friends.	Xitaa waxaad noqon kartaa saaxiibo.
I did not understand why he was alone	Ma fahmin sababta uu keligiis u ahaa
He is busy	Waa mashquul
And maybe that's right.	Oo malaha waa sax.
I can't let you stay here	Ma ogolaan karo inaad halkan joogto
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
I think we need more.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan u baahanahay wax badan.
I like to talk a lot	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax badan ka hadlo
They believe this but it is not true.	Way rumaysan yihiin tan laakiin run maaha.
Him and all the rest.	Isaga iyo inta kale oo dhan.
I don't know what it will do to me.	Ma garanayo waxay igu samayn doonto.
I was not able to do it	Ma awoodin inaan sameeyo
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
There is no way he is with me.	Ma jirto si uu aniga ila jiro.
He was right after all.	Waxa uu ahaa sax ka dib oo dhan.
I would like to see it first	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan marka hore arko
They may not understand.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan fahmin.
I fell.	Waan ka dhacay.
All I need is.	Waxa kaliya ee aan u baahanahay.
I can't leave now	Hadda ma bixi karo
I have no problem seeing it.	Wax dhib ah kama qabo inaan arko.
It was very, very bad for me.	Waxay ii ahayd mid aad u xun, mid aad u xun.
All is but nothing.	Dhammaan waa laakiin waxba.
It really isn't there.	Runtii ma joogo.
I told him everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegi jiray.
He cannot be a man.	Nin ma noqon karo.
But a lot.	Laakiin wax badan.
I asked her where she wanted to go	Waxaan waydiiyay halka ay rabto inay aado
He was right.	Wuxuu ahaa mid sax ah.
I went to the door and no one was there	Albaabka ayaan aaday cidna ma joogin
I saw you and thought you were so beautiful	Waan ku arkay oo waxaan mooday inaad aad u qurux badan tahay
I do not know now.	Ma garanayo hadda.
I think that is it	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay
Nothing was left out.	Ma jirin wax meesha ka baxay.
I could not leave	Waan bixi waayay
No one wants to do it alone.	Qofna ma rabo inuu keligiis sameeyo.
Great guy to do.	Nin aad u fiican in uu sameeyo.
But that is the only reason.	Laakiin taasi waa sababta kaliya.
Less was said.	In ka yar baa la odhan jiray.
I do not know how it will end	Ma garanayo sida ay ku dhammaan doonto
I still can't say.	Wali ma sheegi karin.
I can't do it	Ma awoodo inaan sameeyo
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
Time to make money	Waqti aad lacag ku samayn lahayd
I really don't know what.	Runtii ma garanayo waxa.
She can still do it.	Weli way samayn kartaa.
I have never seen him so young	Weligay ma arag isaga oo aad u yar
More so, as before.	Si ka sii badan, sidii hore.
Much less.	In badan oo ka yar.
I can't believe he will do that	Ma rumaysan karo inuu taas samayn doono
I did not think so	Ma aan malaynayn
I think there is no time	Waxaan filayaa in aanu wakhti jirin
I didn't want to see him.	Maan rabin inuu arko.
I knew we could do it.	Waan ogaa inaan sameyn karno.
I haven't told you before	Hadda ka hor ayaan kuu sheegi waayay
He got it before he found me.	Waxa uu helay ka hor inta aan i helin.
Tell them something.	Wax u sheeg.
I will not help you here	Anigu halkan kuma caawin doono
I love you friend.	Ku jeclahay saaxiib.
I know you will love it.	Waan ogahay inaad jeclaan doonto.
I was there, you know	Waan joogay, waad ogtahay
I wanted to eat there	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas ku cuno
He said I'm not sure.	Wuxuu yidhi ma hubo.
I wanted to do it seriously	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo si dhab ah
I have never been able to do that	Weligay ma awoodin inaan sidaas sameeyo
I need food	Waxaan u baahanahay cunto
I have something for you.	wax baan kuu hayaa.
I am who she is.	aniga ayaa ah kan ay tahay.
I still haven't found it.	Wali maan helin.
It's a clear job.	Waa shaqo cad.
I think he will leave	Waxaan filayaa inuu iska bixi doono
I became someone else	Waxaan noqday qof kale
I think that can help	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ku caawin karto
I had that and more	Taas iyo wax ka badan ayaan ku lahaa
We are one.	Mid baan nahay.
I didn't think it was a good idea	Uma malaynayn inay fikrad fiican tahay
I would take this one day	Waxaan qaadan lahaa tan hal maalin mar
Very good too	Mid aad u fiican sidoo kale
But, it looks like that will not be the case anymore.	Laakiin, waxay u egtahay in taasi aysan sii ahaan doonin wax badan.
Nothing was set	Waxba lama dhigay
Work.	Shaqo.
I did not know him	Maan garanayn isaga
I know it's not just me.	Waan ogahay in aysan aniga kaliya ahayn.
I wanted to be part of it.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo.
But much bigger.	Laakiin aad uga weyn.
I felt bad for leaving the house	Waxaan dareemay wax xun inaan isaga tago guriga
That being said.	Sidaas ayaa lagu yiri.
It doesn't look like much.	Wax badan uma eka.
It's hard to say, no one sure.	Way adag tahay in la sheego, qofna ma hubo.
Not true.	Run maaha.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
He said nothing	Waxba ma odhan
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
I want you to be there	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaas joogto
I just took it, it's all	Kaliya waan qaatay, waa dhan
I will get that.	Waan heli doonaa sidaas.
That is correct	Taasi waa sax
That is what he really likes.	Taasi waa waxa uu runtii jecel yahay.
It has to be real.	Waa inuu dhab yahay.
I have tried it several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan isku dayay
I picked it up and took it with me	Waan soo qaaday oo ila qaatay
I do not know if he saw it.	Ma garanayo inuu arkay.
As you said.	Sida aad sheegtay.
He seemed to do nothing	Waxa uu u muuqday in aanu waxba samayn
I am sure you will do the same for me	Waxaan hubaa inaad sidaas oo kale ii samayn doonto
What he did was very good.	Waxa uu sameeyay ayaa ahaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
I did some work for it	Waxaan u sameeyay xoogaa shaqo ah
I wonder what else he thinks he is good at	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa kale ee uu u malaynayo inuu ku fiican yahay
You don't have to do this, you know.	Ma aha inaad tan sameyso, waad ogtahay.
I will never see him again	Mar dambe ma arki doono isaga
I think it's a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa inay fikrad fiican tahay.
That would come soon.	Taasi waxay iman lahayd dhawaan.
I do not love you.	kuma jecli.
I will do it	waan samayn doonaa
I wanted to talk to him	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo
Nice to see you there	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko halkaas
But not everyone.	Laakiin qof walba ma aha.
I have no idea where it might be	Waxaan qabaa fikrad halka ay noqon karto
You know it would happen.	Waad ogtahay inay dhici lahayd.
I really haven't done any work yet	Runtii wali maan qaban wax shaqo ah
I just wanted to know	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan ogaado
Less is better.	In ka yar ayaa ugu fiican.
I wonder if she does	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay sameyso
I do not want it to be any other way	Ma doonayo inuu si kale noqdo
It is a false idea.	Waa fikrad been ah.
I was surprised	waan kula yaabay
I think a few people are better	Waxaan u maleynayaa in dadka yar ay ka wanaagsan yihiin
I think she is a good person	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay qof wanaagsan
But he will, he will.	Laakiin wuu yeeli doonaa, wuu yeeli doonaa.
Not sure what to do	Ma hubo waxaan sameeyo
That would not be true.	Taasi run ma ahaan lahayd.
This is no small feat.	Tani wax yar maaha.
He is happy now.	Hadda wuu faraxsan yahay.
This was a new idea	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad cusub
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
I can't get close.	Anigu ma heli karo si dhow.
I was surprised not to see it there	Waxaan la yaabay inaan halkaas ku arag
I am very scared	Aad ayaan uga baqayaa
I am afraid	waxaan ka baqayaa
I made time for everything	Wax walba waqti ayaan u sameeyay
I did not know where she was	Meel ay joogto maan garanayn
He looked at the rest.	Inta kale ayuu dib u eegay.
I just don’t know who is available.	Kaliya ma garanayo cidda la heli karo.
I know what he wants to do	Waan ogahay waxa uu rabo inuu sameeyo
I can't find a friend	Ma heli karo saaxiib
I hope you will be fine	Waxaan filayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto
I hope to go there again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale aadi doono halkaas
This takes time.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay waqti.
He was never paid.	Waligiis lacag lama siin.
I really had to learn how to do that	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan barto sida loo sameeyo taas
I could not imagine what was to come	Ma malayn karin waxa soo socda
Don't tell anyone.	Aan cidna waxba u sheegin.
I really wanted to go	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan tago
He is not ready.	Diyaar uma aha.
I got paid	Waxaan helay lacag
Slightly smaller.	In yar oo ka yar.
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
I need to see you now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko hadda
I knew you would help me	Waan ogaa inaad i caawin doonto
I felt true.	Waxaan dareemay run.
Why was he there? 	Muxuu u joogay?
he wondered.	ayuu is waydiiyay.
It does not exist now.	Hadda ma jirto.
I returned to work	Waxaan ku soo noqday shaqada
It should be for a while.	Waa in muddo ah.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
I went later	Waxaan aaday markii dambe
Person to person.	Qof ilaa qof.
Me, one, I would love to.	Aniga, mid, waan jeclaan lahaa.
It doesn't matter to me	Waxba igama yara
I have done that before.	Taas hore ayaan u sameeyay.
No one will come.	Qofna ma iman doono.
Isn't that a lucky day.	Miyaanay ahayn maalin nasiib badan.
He had no food.	Wax cunto ah ma lahayn.
I still had to know that	Weli waxay ahayd inaan taas ogaado
A lot more than you know.	Wax badan oo ka badan inta aad ogtahay.
This is really, what can be seen.	Tani waa runtii, waxa la arki karo.
I love him, more so	Waan jeclahay isaga, si ka sii badan
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
I had a place to go, someone to be with	Waxaan lahaa meel aan aado, qof aan la joogo
Everyone really loves it.	Qof walba runtii wuu jecel yahay.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
I want to help you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
Every time.	Mar walba.
That sounds like a good idea.	Taasi waxay ila tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
She says nothing.	Waxba ma sheegto.
I wish she would help you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay ku caawin doonto
Not right yet.	Sax maaha weli.
As we do now.	Sida aan hadda samayno.
It was a beautiful little place.	Waxay ahayd meel yar oo qurux badan.
To talk to.	Si aan ula hadlo.
Maybe you have better things to do, too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad leedahay waxyaabo ka fiican oo aad sameyso, sidoo kale.
They are too many for us.	Aad bay noo badan yihiin.
What happened.	Maxaa dhacay.
I hope they are really good	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay runtii wanaagsan yihiin
I couldn’t tell that.	Ma u sheegi karin taas.
I expect more to come	Waxaan filayaa inay wax badan iman doonaan
I think she was like him	Waxaan filayaa inay isaga la mid ahayd
I did not know you looked like that	Maan garanayn inaad sidaas u egtahay
I can't believe she did this.	Ma rumaysan karo inay tan samaysay.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
The reason was not.	Sababta ma ahayn.
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
But there may be another truth.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto run kale.
He was not the person he wanted to see.	Ma ahayn qofka uu rabo inuu arko.
He has to speak.	Waa inuu hadlo.
Maybe I can learn from you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax kaa barto.
I am very sorry for him.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga.
I really hope you like it	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad rabto
Too bad, it was good.	Aad u xun, waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I'm sure he wants to talk to you	Waan hubaa inuu doonayo inuu kula hadlo
And you have.	Oo aad leedahay.
I know that for sure	Waan ogahay taas hubaal
There was still a lot to do.	Weli waxaa jiray wax badan oo ay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I wonder why that is.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta taasi tahay.
I did not know it was included	Maan garanayn inay ku jirto
Let them talk.	Ha la wada hadlo.
I can believe everything you say	Waan rumaysan karaa wax kasta oo aad tidhi
I didn’t get, if any, bad enough for me.	Ma aanan helin, haddii ay tahay, mid xun oo igu filan.
Just every day.	Kaliya maalin kasta.
I gave it a chance after a chance	Waxaan siiyay fursad ka dib fursad
Not done after, but before.	Lama sameeyo ka dib, laakiin ka hor.
It will not be	Ma noqon doono
And not too much.	Oo aan aad u badan.
I am right	run baan ahay
I told you.	waan kuu sheegay.
But maybe also.	Laakiin sidoo kale laga yaabaa.
I can clearly see	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa
You would have a very bad time.	Waxaad heli lahayd waqti aad u xun.
He says nothing, nothing.	Waxa uu leeyahay waxba ma aha, waxba maaha.
I think the job is good for him	Waxaan u maleynayaa in shaqada isaga u fiican
They usually do.	Inta badan way sameeyaan.
I know it's bad.	Waan ogahay inay xun tahay.
We are definitely ready.	Hubaal diyaar ayaan nahay.
You know you did.	Waad ogtahay inaad samaysay.
I wanted something else	Wax kale ayaan rabay
There was no one there.	Meesha qofna ma jirin.
What is this.	Waa maxay waxaan.
I wanted more	Wax badan ayaan rabay
I need you to know that	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad taas ogaato
That was true.	Taas oo run ahayd.
I didn't even have to say it	Ma ahayn inaan xitaa sheego
And now it is.	Oo hadda waa.
I owe you everything	Wax walba waan ku leeyahay
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
I have a lot of friends there.	Waxaan halkaas ku leeyahay saaxiibo badan.
Quickly a few years ago.	Si degdeg ah dhowr sano ka hor.
I did not know this.	Maan garanayn tan.
But there was not enough.	Laakiin ma jirin wax ku filan.
Not this.	Ma aha tan.
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
I once asked why	Mar ayaan waydiiyay sababta
I think she can stay here	Waxaan filayaa inay halkan joogi karto
I can love a man again one day	Waxaan mar kale jeclaan karaa nin mar kale maalin
But he made it better.	Laakiin wuxuu ka dhigay mid ka wanaagsan.
I am always sorry to be held.	Mar walba waan ka xumahay in la haysto.
Such a good man.	Nin wanaagsan oo kale.
Nice to see.	Si fiican in la arko.
That was a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
Not too big.	Aad uma weyn.
He should not do so.	Waa inuusan sidaas samayn.
And other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale.
To do so.	In sidaas la sameeyo.
More than me.	Wax iga sii badan.
I just want to be your friend	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiib kuu noqdo
Maybe I also know how to do it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale ogaado sida loo sameeyo
I will do it now.	hadda waan samayn doonaa.
He got one.	Mid buu helay.
He didn't have much money.	Lacag badan ma uu haysan.
Really not sure	Runtii ma hubo
It looks real.	Waxay u egtahay mid dhab ah.
It was unimaginable.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la malayn karin.
I always told you it would be back	Had iyo jeer waxaan kuu sheegi jiray inay dib noqon doonto
And to be sure.	Iyo in la hubo.
I have not told anyone about this	Tan qofna uma sheegin
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I would definitely stay there again	Dhab ahaantii waan sii joogi lahaa halkaas mar kale
This is new to him.	Tani waa ku cusub isaga.
It may not be, but it is.	Ma noqon karto, laakiin waa.
I looked at you.	Waan ku eegay.
Unable to detect	Ma awoodo in la ogaado
I was told it was not	Waxa la ii sheegay in aanay ahayn
More work is still needed.	Shaqo badan ayaa weli loo baahan yahay.
You are well and tall.	Si fiican baad u fiican tahay oo dheer tahay.
He wants me to do it.	Wuxuu iga rabaa inaan sameeyo.
I will give it a chance	Waxaan siin doonaa fursad
I did not want to see you here	Maan rabin inaan ku arko halkan
I can't figure out	Ma awoodo inaan ogaado
How can it be.	Sidee bay noqon kartaa.
I did not want to know what was going on	Maan rabin inaan ogaado waxa socda
I'm sorry but that's the way things are	Waan ka xumahay laakiin waa sida wax u jiraan
I would be fine now	Waan fiicnaan lahaa hadda
I can do this for you	Tan waan kuu samayn karaa
I came in and took it	Waan soo galay oo qaatay
But there is no such thing there.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax la mid ah halkaas.
This is a bigger problem than that.	Tani waa dhibaato ka weyn taas.
We would not go anywhere else	Meel kale ma aadi lahayn
He should be at home now.	Waa inuu hadda guriga joogo.
I was one of them now	Waxaan ka mid ahaa hadda
I still have a lot to learn	Weli waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan barto
I want to learn something new	Waxaan rabaa inaan barto wax cusub
A little time.	Waqti yar.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo inay u badan tahay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
I hope you have one too	Waxaan filayaa inaad mid leedahay sidoo kale
Little has been said.	Wax yar baa la yidhi.
I haven't seen him in a while	In muddo ah maan arag
I think he is beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inuu qurux badan yahay.
She did not want to lie.	Ma rabin inay been sheegto.
You know it can be done.	Waad ogtahay in la samayn karo.
I should have seen the next one	Waxay ahayd inaan arko kan soo socda
I did not want to know	Maan rabin inaan ogaado
She loves money	Waxay jeceshahay lacag
I looked around the room again	Qolka ayaan mar kale eegay
I decided to go	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan u tago
I did not know where he was	Meel uu joogo maan garanayn
I know what you can do	Waan ogahay waxaad samayn karto
It wasn’t a job, really.	Ma ahayn shaqo, runtii.
Maybe, maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, ma laga yaabaa.
I think everyone has.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu leeyahay.
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula hadlo.
We have to do that first.	Waa inaan marka hore samayno taas.
It goes a little farther	Wax yar baa meel dheer u socda
I am sure you will do well.	Waxaan hubaa inaad si fiican wax u qaban doonto.
I just tried to do a good job	Kaliya waxaan isku dayay inaan sameeyo shaqo wanaagsan
He said he was not.	Wuxuu sheegay in uusan ahayn.
He is with him now.	Hadda wuu la joogaa.
I had to talk to you	Waxay ahayd inaan kula hadlo
You are like me.	Waxaad tahay aniga oo kale.
Otherwise she would not be here.	Haddii kale halkan ma joogi lahayd.
I think it's not much	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaysan ahayn wax badan
Do you not understand?	Miyaadan fahmin adiga.
I would go home	Waxaan aadi lahaa guriga
This she did.	Tani waxay samaysay.
There is no problem here.	Halkan wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
Otherwise it can go away.	Haddii kale way ka bixi kartaa.
But something appeared.	Laakiin wax baa u muuqday.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
I haven't seen it in a while, really	In muddo ah maan arag, run ahaantii
I know what he did to you	Waan ogahay waxa uu kugu sameeyay
Not much indeed.	Ma badna runtii.
But not just any job.	Laakiin maaha kaliya shaqo kasta.
I would not go	ma aadi lahaa
Lots of money.	Lacag badan.
That was nothing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan waxba ahayn.
I think that's the case now.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay hadda.
No one will see this.	Qofna ma arki doono kan.
As a matter of fact, now.	Sida run ahaantii, hadda.
I'm afraid this is a lot of time to find out	Waxaan ka baqayaa in tani ay tahay waqti badan oo wax la ogaado
I still did not know how to leave	Wali maan garanayn si aan uga baxo
He looked at the door.	Albaabka ayuu eegay.
Now it can be very fast.	Hadda waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u degdeg badan.
It's very, very interesting.	Waa wax aad iyo aad u xiiso badan.
I found.	Waan helay.
You can't stop.	Ma joojin kartid.
I have another idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad kale.
I don't want to tell you.	Ma rabo inaan kuu sheego.
Most have been found recently.	Inta badan waxa la helay wakhti dhow.
They do amazing things.	Waxay sameeyaan waxyaabo yaab leh.
I picked it up again.	Mar kale ayaan soo qaaday.
There are things you can do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aad sameyn karto.
I really need to know everything now	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax walba ogaado hadda
I'm really sorry about that	Runtii waan ka xumahay taas
Also, if we can help, they will not help.	Sidoo kale, haddii aan caawin karno, ma ay caawin doonaan.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
He was very surprised.	Aad buu ula yaabay.
And that everyone else has.	Iyo in qof kasta oo kale leeyahay.
I want you to promise me	Waxaan rabaa in aad ii ballan qaado
I had to do very difficult things	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo waxyaabo aad u adag
That will be later.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mar dambe.
I think he is still there	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu weli halkaas joogo
It was a little of everything.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo wax walba ah.
He would find something to do.	Wuxuu u heli lahaa wax uu sameeyo.
I did not want him to come with me	Maan rabin inuu ila yimaado
I did nothing	Waxba maan samayn
I would say that	Taas ayaan ku odhan lahaa
He is not with me now.	Hadda ma ila joogaa.
I will not do that	Anigu taas yeeli maayo
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
I wish she was here with me now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay halkan ila joogto hadda
I am an old man.	Waxaan ahay nin hore u ah.
It can do this.	Way samayn kartaa tan.
He does what he is told.	Wuu sameeyaa wixii lagu yidhi.
I don't think they will take us.	U malayn maayo in ay naga qaadan doonaan.
I should have told you earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore kuu sheego
He would see what could be done.	Wuu arki lahaa waxa la samayn karo.
Leave the room.	Ka tagay qolka.
I want to do this right	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan si sax ah u sameeyo
As of now.	Sida hadda.
once you had an idea.	hal mar ayaad fikrad lahayd.
I wish they did	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay sameeyaan
The latter saw it and came out.	Kii dambe ayaa arkay oo soo baxay.
We would see, for sure.	Waan arki lahayn, hubaal sida.
I think maybe you can do it	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo inaad ku samayn karto
We need him closer.	Waxaan u baahanahay isaga oo ka sii dhow.
Now he looked.	Hadda ayuu eegay.
I will do everything for you.	Wax walba waan kuu qaban doonaa.
That was hard, very hard.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag, aad u adag.
I need to go to work	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqada tago
This is really good.	Tani runtii waa mid wanaagsan.
I can't even find him.	Xitaa ma heli karo isaga.
And they did not.	Oo ma ay samayn.
I am very happy to be here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo
I wonder how he did it	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida uu u sameeyay
A man never does.	Nin waligiis ma sameeyo.
But there was nothing to do.	Laakiin ma jirin wax la sameeyo.
I have to do something good	Waa inaan wax wanaagsan sameeyay
And there are more and more of us.	Oo waxaa noo badan iyo ka badan oo naga mid ah.
I found this very interesting	Tan waxaan ka helay mid aad u xiiso badan
Everyone knows where he can find us.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa meesha uu naga heli karo.
Everyone is unemployed.	Qof kastaa waa shaqo la'aan.
I am here	waan joogaa halkan
I know it's not right	Waan ogahay inaysan sax ahayn
I have something to do	wax aan sameeyo ayaan hayaa
No problems were found	Wax dhibaato ah lama helin
I can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karo.
It was hard work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
The latter is always the best.	Dambe had iyo jeer waa ugu fiican.
I really know that	Runtii taas waan ogahay
But this is.	Laakiin tani waa.
That would be something new.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax cusub.
She would leave tomorrow.	Berri way bixi lahayd.
I can't do anything about that.	Taas waxba kama qaban karo.
But it failed.	Laakiin waa lagu guulaysan waayay.
I may not even find him	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan xitaa helin isaga
I think, you know, he is there	Waxaan u malaynayaa, waad ogtahay, inuu halkaas joogo
I will not say anything.	waxba odhan maayo.
I want to stay home	Waxaan rabaa inaan guriga joogo
I can't do what he says	Ma qaban karo waxa uu leeyahay
He could not.	Waa awoodi waayay.
To him.	Ilaa isaga.
And a bit lucky.	Iyo xoogaa nasiib ah.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
That really is a good thing.	Runtii taasi waa wax fiican.
I could not stay there for a long time	Halkaas ma joogi karin muddo aad u dheer
She rejected me.	Way i diiday.
It was a great time together.	Waqti fiican ayaa la wada lahaa.
I am not present.	Anigu hadda ma joogo.
But that is correct.	Laakiin taasi waa sax.
I had no friends.	Maan lahayn saaxiibo.
She is your favorite.	Waa adiga ay ku jeceshahay.
It was really hard	Runtii waxay ahayd mid adag
I still had a lot to learn.	Weli waxaan lahaa wax badan oo aan barto.
I need you to do something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad wax sameyso
They could not let you do that	Uma ogolaan karin inay sidaas kugu sameeyaan
I think they do not always know what	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaysan garanayn waxa mar walba
I could not tell him	Waan u sheegi waayay
I did not know it was him	Maan garanayn inuu isaga yahay
I do not know what else to tell you	Ma garanayo wax kale oo aan kuu sheego
I'm sure you can probably make good money	Waxaan hubaa inaad u badan tahay inaad heli karto lacag fiican
I did not know where anyone was.	Meesha qofna maan garanayn.
I will do that.	Waan samayn doonaa taas.
That is,.	Taasi waa,.
I wanted to get to know you better	Waxaan rabay in aan si fiican kuu barto
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
Certainly not that.	Hubaal in aanay taasi waxba ka jirin.
He had it all.	Isaga oo dhan buu lahaa.
That's right.	Waa sax.
I do not understand why	Sababta wax ma fahmin
It is the only thing that will stop him.	Waa waxa kaliya ee isaga joojin doona.
I still have a lot to do	Weli wax badan oo aan qaban karo ayaan hayaa
He was very bad.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u xun.
This is more than enough.	Tani waa in ka badan oo ku filan.
I was very impressed	Aad baan ula dhacay
They were not there.	Ma ay lahayn halkaas.
Really interesting.	Runtii aad u xiiso badan.
I think that requires some work	Waxaan filayaa in taasi u baahan tahay xoogaa shaqo ah
I want to help you do that.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa caawiyo inaad taas sameyso.
There was really nothing that anyone could do for him.	Runtii ma jirin wax uu qof u qaban karo isaga.
I had to find a new job	Waxay ahayd inaan shaqo cusub helo
But I can't find it.	Laakiin ma heli karo.
It was a quick job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo degdeg ah.
Now that is enough for me	Hadda ayaa igu filan
I will not be harmed until later	La iga yeeli maayo ilaa goor dambe
There was no one there.	Meesha qofna ma jirin.
I love how it feels	Waan jeclahay sida uu dareemayo
Someone must have left here.	Waa in qof halkan uga tagay.
You really should.	Runtii waa inaad.
Not sure what she needs.	Ma hubo waxa ay u baahan tahay.
There is and it is difficult.	Waxaa jira oo ay adag tahay.
It was not a good thing to know.	Ma ahayn wax wanaagsan in la ogaado.
He could not let her do this	Uma ogolaan karin inuu tan sameeyo
It may not be a car.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ahayn baabuur.
It did not end there.	Halkaas kuma ay dhammaan.
I had to tell you everything	Waxay ahayd inaan wax walba kuu sheego
So far, very good.	Ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan.
It was a given.	Waxay ahayd wax la siiyay.
I did not like him	Maan jeclayn isaga
I could not believe what had happened	Waan rumaysan waayay waxa dhacay
I just want to see where they live	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko halka ay ku nool yihiin
You know you would.	Waad ogtahay inaad sameyn lahayd.
I did that for you	Taas waan kuu sameeyay
I had to say more	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan sheego
It had to be said.	Waxay ahayd in la sheego.
Now there was nothing more to be done.	Hadda ma jirin wax aan ahayn in la sameeyo.
I do not know what.	Ma garanayo waxa.
I knew you would say that	Waan ogaa inaad sidaas odhan lahayd
I think it would be nice to stay here.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan lahayd inaad halkan sii joogto.
I wanted more	Wax badan ayaan ka rabay
I looked very much	Aad baan u eegay
They do not exist now.	Hadda ma jiraan.
Like you.	Adiga oo kale.
It will be fine	Way fiicnaan doontaa
Probably more than one.	Malaha in ka badan hal.
I think she likes me very much	Waxaan filayaa inay aad ii jeceshahay
But obviously he wasn’t, yet.	Laakiin si cad ma uusan ahayn, weli.
I have a problem you can help me with	Waxaan qabaa dhibaato aad iga caawin karto
I can hardly believe it	Si dhib ah uma rumaysan karo
I didn't even want to go	Xitaa maan rabin inaan tago
No more problems.	Dhib dambe ma aha.
I'm glad it's me	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu aniga yahay
I want to see that again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale arko taas
A man appeared at the door	Albaabka waxaa ka soo muuqday nin
Maybe that was a good thing.	Malaha taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii way qurux badan tahay.
In fact, he did not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma uusan lahayn.
They are in this together.	Waxay ku wada jiraan tan.
Really, I really wanted to leave him.	Runtii, runtii waxaan rabay inaan isaga tago.
She refused.	Waxba way diiday.
I could not take this	Waan qaadan waayay tan
I never told anyone	Weligay cidna uma sheego
Certainly it can be.	Hubaal waxay noqon kartaa.
I had to be there	Waxay ahayd in aan halkaas joogo
I am just the best.	Kaliya waxaan ahay kan ugu fiican.
There was so much.	Wax badan baa jiray.
I saw.	Waan arkay.
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
I will not say anything	Waxba sheegi maayo
Everyone is good at it.	Qof kastaa wuu ku fiican yahay.
I hardly know what it is	Si dhib ah uma garanayo waxa uu yahay
I had no idea this was going to happen	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay tani iman doonto
It can be non-existent.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax aan jirin.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
Just so here.	Kaliya sidaas halkan.
I'm sure you would agree	Waan hubaa inaad ogolaan lahayd
Surprising, but everything.	La yaab leh, laakiin wax kasta.
I think it is interesting	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay mid xiiso leh
I did the same thing	Waxaan sameeyay wax la mid ah
I can say that no one is out of here	Waxaan sheegi karaa in qofna uusan halkan ka soo bixin
This is the best way to get it.	Tani waa sida ugu wanaagsan ee loo helo.
More than you.	Si ka badan adiga.
That would do.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd.
He did everything he was supposed to do.	Wuxuu sameeyay wax kasta oo la rabay inuu sameeyo.
I have to be in this one.	Waa inaan ku jiraa kan.
She can't leave.	Ma bixi karto.
I love to learn	Waxaan jeclahay in aan barto
Every day and every day.	Maalin kasta iyo maalin kasta.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
Much more.	Wax badan oo kale.
I asked him why he was there	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu u joogo
The person.	Qofka.
Now I got a job there	Hadda waxaan ka helay shaqo halkaas
I do not know what.	Ma garanayo waxa.
I told him what you did	Waxaan u sheegay waxaad samaysay
You will love it	Waad jeclaan doontaa
Tell them what you want.	U sheeg waxaad rabto.
This was not a bad thing.	Tani ma ahayn wax xun.
Now you may not want to do this every day.	Hadda waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan rabin inaad tan sameyso maalin kasta.
I knew this was going to happen	Waan ogaa inay tani dhici doonto
Take one if you don't have one.	Mid qaado haddii aadan mid lahayn.
I think he will do very well.	Waxaan filayaa inuu aad u wanaagsan samayn doono.
I could not do anything	waxba maan qaban karin
It will not go away.	Kama bixi doonto.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
I just wanted to be left alone	Kaliya waxaan rabay in la iga tago
There must be more.	Waa inay jiraan wax badan.
But that is to be expected.	Laakiin taasi waa la filayaa.
We will not have anything difficult to do.	Ma haysan doono wax adag inaan samayno.
I want to talk to you again soon	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale kula hadlo dhawaan
I should not have told anyone.	Waxay ahayd inaan cidna u sheegin.
If it had happened, we would not have been friends.	Haddii ay dhici lahayd, dhib ma lahayn in aanu saaxiib nahay.
I just wanted to know.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan ogaado.
Like a living thing.	Sida wax nool.
I thought you were a problem	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad dhibaato tahay
I want to leave here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ka baxo
I did not know he was here	Maan garanayn inuu halkan joogo
You may not have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan haysan mid.
New people.	Dadka cusub.
Nothing really great.	Wax runtii weyn ma jiraan.
I will not do that here	Taas halkan kuma samayn doono
I would talk a little bit about that.	Wax yar ayaan taas ka hadli lahaa.
Maybe one day you will.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in maalin aad doonto.
I fell for him again	Mar kale ayaan isaga ku dhacay
I am afraid of everything.	Wax walba waan ka baqayaa.
I did not like it but it has to be done	Maan jeclayn laakiin waa in la sameeyaa
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I want to know everything now	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ogaado hadda
It is very interesting.	Aad bay u xiiso badan tahay.
He is close here.	Wuu ku dhow yahay halkan.
You think they are.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inay yihiin.
I know the best place	Waan ogahay meesha ugu fiican
I tried to be	Waxaan isku dayay inaan noqdo
This is not for you.	Tani ma aha adiga.
Take whatever you want.	Qaado wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I would like to get to know you better.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan si fiican kuu barto.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
You can get it if you want.	Waad heli kartaa haddii aad rabto.
I really wanted to talk to you	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo
I heard about this later.	Mar dambe ayaan arrintan maqlay.
I wondered what it was all about	Waxaan la yaabay waxa kan wada
Once found.	Mar la helo.
He just has to.	Kaliya waa inuu.
There is a time.	Waqti ayaa jira.
I went to the front door	Waxaan tagay albaabka hore
Something strange happened.	Wax la yaab leh ayaa dhacay.
He got one.	Mid buu helay.
She had him.	Waxay lahayd isaga.
And probably more.	Iyo malaha badan.
I need you to tell me you want me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ii sheegto inaad i rabto
I got it started	Waan helay oo bilaabay
She will believe that.	Way rumaysan doontaa taas.
But let me see you again.	Laakiin aan mar kale arko.
To leave him.	Si uu isaga baxo.
But this is too much.	Laakiin tani aad bay u badan tahay.
But that was to be expected.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid la filan karo.
He did not come home.	Guriga uma iman.
I tried to talk to him	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la hadlo
But you did.	Laakiin waad samaysay.
I have no idea that.	Wax fikrad ah kama qabo taas.
I may not even have a chance to talk to her.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa fursad u helin inaan la hadlo.
I expect that to be done	Waxaan filayaa in taas la sameeyo
I did not say	Anigu ma aan sheegin
I will do it, he thought, if so	Waan yeeli doonaa, ayuu u maleeyay, haddii ay sidaas tahay
told a friend.	u sheegay saaxiib.
She was one man.	Waxay ahayd hal nin.
I really can't talk about that	Runtii taas kama hadli karo
So are the people.	Waa sidaas oo kale dadka.
I want you to know that you can get it	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato inaad heli karto
One more day.	Hal maalin oo kale.
I used to do this every day.	Waxaan tan samayn jiray maalin kasta.
I have to see what happened	Waa inaan arko waxa dhacay
It was really that	Waxay ahayd runtii taas
I could not believe it	Waan rumaysan waayay
Maybe you can do something about it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad wax ka qaban karto.
Say nothing, do nothing.	Waxba ha odhan, waxba ha samayn.
In fact, it is the same for each and every one of them.	Runtii, waa isku mid mid kasta iyo mid kasta.
That is the only thing everyone sees.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee qof kastaa arko.
He was just a friend.	Waxa uu ahaa saaxiib oo kaliya.
I thought you would be home now	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad guriga noqon doonto hadda
That was so beautiful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
I could not allow that.	Ma ogolaan karin taas.
I am in it	waan ku jiraa
And it's still hard.	Oo weli way adag tahay.
I can do whatever you want	Waxaan samayn karaa wax kasta oo aad rabto
I need something better	Waxaan u baahanahay wax ka fiican
I would like to know what it looks like	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sida ay u egtahay
Nothing is right, nothing is as it is.	Ma jiro wax sax ah, ma jiraan sida ay tahay.
Everyone can see that.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa taas.
Also, it can’t be better.	Sidoo kale, ma fiicnaan karto.
I thought he needed to know that	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu u baahan yahay inuu taas ogaado
I didn’t know it would hurt.	Maan ogayn inay wax yeeli doonto.
But this is where they get interesting.	Laakiin tani waa meesha ay ka heli xiiso.
I am very skeptical.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay.
Surprising, but very good.	La yaab, laakiin aad u fiican.
I'm sure someone can help me !.	Waxaan hubaa in uu qof i caawin karo!.
He did not want to leave.	Ma uusan rabin inuu baxo.
I have not seen much.	In badan ma arag.
I think this is it	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay tani tahay
I just could not be seen	Kaliya waa la i arki waayay
I thought that was all.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay dhan tahay.
But not anymore.	Laakiin mar dambe maaha.
I knew it wasn't real from the beginning, he thought.	Waan ogaa in aanay ahayn mid dhab ah tan iyo markii hore, ayuu u maleeyay.
I can't think right now	Ma malayn karo hadda
I think that is true so far	Waxaan filayaa in taasi run tahay ilaa hadda
It wasn’t as much visible as it felt.	Ma ahayn wax aad u badan oo la arki karo sida la dareemay.
I have no more problems	Dhib dambe igama qabo
I didn’t know that.	Maan ogayn taas.
No one can.	Qofna ma awoodo.
No one is sure what to do about it.	Qofna ma hubo waxa laga samaynayo.
It didn't take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan.
Don't do it for another.	Mid kale ha u qaban.
A lot, really.	Wax badan, dhab ahaantii.
I will tell you everything that happened	Wax walba oo dhacay waan kuu sheegi doonaa
You may not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan ahayn.
I have seen this before	Tan hore ayaan u arkay
I can't do it.	Ma awoodo inaan sameeyo.
He wanted to see.	Wuxuu rabay inuu arko.
You know she did.	Waad ogtahay inay samaysay.
I know it's true.	Waan ogahay inay run tahay.
I do not know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I have no idea what is in it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku jira
I love it all very much	Aad iyo aad ayaan u jeclahay dhammaan
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
Tell them you are busy.	U sheeg inaad mashquul tahay.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inay ogaato.
This was so much more.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
I will never do anything else for you.	Weligay wax kale kugu samayn maayo.
Someone really came in here.	Runtii qof baa halkan soo galay.
I just do not know.	Kaliya ma garanayo.
I wonder why she did it	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta ay u samaysay
I do not know where you are and what happened	Meel aad joogto iyo waxa dhacay maan garanayn
This is great.	Tani waa mid aad u fiican.
I can't say what he wants	Ma sheegi karo waxa uu rabo
I didn't know and it didn't matter.	Maan garanayn oo dhib ma lahayn.
I did not take any money.	Wax lacag ah maan qaadan.
I wanted him to come back badly	Waxaan rabay inuu si xun u soo noqdo
I want to know all of them	Waxaan rabaa inaan wada ogaado
How good that is !.	Sidee u fiican taas!.
As I was.	Sida aan anigu ahaa.
You said it was a great job.	Waxaad sheegtay inay ahayd shaqo weyn.
I have tried before, but to no avail	Mar hore ayaan isku dayay, laakiin kuma guulaysan
And don't tell me what you are.	Oo ha ii sheegin waxa aad tahay.
I did not know this person	Maan garanayn tan qof
I saw it a while ago.	Wax yar ka hor ayaan arkay.
It just wasn’t surprising.	Kaliya ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
Really well done.	Runtii si wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
I think it's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiican tahay.
I was the only one in the room	Waxaan ahaa ka kaliya ee qolka
It happened three times.	Saddex jeer ayaa dhacay.
I was ready to go.	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan tago.
I really can't believe it	Runtii ma rumaysan karo
It is all as it was.	Dhammaan waa sidii ay ahayd.
I'm back, obviously	Waan soo noqday, si cad
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
Definitely one of them.	Dhab ahaantii mid ka mid ah.
One that is really good.	Mid ay runtii ku fiican tahay.
I was here	halkaan ayaan joogay
He was not here.	Ma uusan joogin halkan.
Not sure.	Lama hubo.
I want to know something first	Waxaan rabaa in aan marka hore wax ka ogaado
I could not find anything to say	Maan helin wax aan sheego
I'm not much.	Ma ihi wax badan.
He may, too, be unwise.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, sidoo kale, inuusan caqli lahayn.
I have nowhere to go	Meel aan aadi lahaa ma hayo
I have something else	Wax kale ayaan hayaa
If they like it, they like it.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin, way jecel yihiin.
I want you to be with us for this.	Waxaan rabaa inaad nala joogto tan.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I do not think this is a good idea	Uma maleynayo in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan
It was as it were.	Waxay ahayd sida ay tahay.
I am a much older man now	Waxaan ahay nin aad uga weyn hadda
I should have seen the following	Waxay ahayd inaan arko soo socda
I am a real person.	Waxaan ahay qof dhab ah.
I think it was busy.	Waxaan filayaa inay mashquul ahayd.
It does not look like it yet.	Ilaa hadda uma eka.
I know how difficult this is	Waan ogahay sida ay tani u adag tahay
I really did not know	Run ahaantii maan garanayn
I did not have time.	Waqti maan helin.
I'm really sorry	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay
I still can't get out	Wali waan soo bixi waayay
There is nothing wrong with that	Ma jiro wax xun oo aan ka sheego
Too many including	Aad u badan oo ay ku jiraan
The same is true for making.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa run u ah samaynta.
Everywhere, doing everything.	Meel kasta, samaynta wax kasta.
I should not have told him	Ma ahayn inaan u sheego
I just want to be friends	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiibo noqdo
But this is something else.	Laakiin tani waa wax kale.
How beautiful is that ?.	Sidee qurux badan taas?.
I would love to do the same here	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sidaas oo kale ku sameeyo halkan
I was really impressed with him	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay isaga
Everything he does is money.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyo waa lacag.
It is really beautiful and well made.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay oo si fiican baa loo sameeyay.
Not me.	Aniga ma aha.
I did not like doing this	Maan jeclayn samaynta tan
But other things as well.	Laakiin waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
Took to work.	U qaaday shaqada.
I want to know why.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta.
That would be nice	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd
Really good.	Dhab ahaantii wanaagsan.
But, it can be just that.	Laakiin, waxay noqon kartaa mid kaliya.
I did not want anyone to find me.	Maan rabin in qofna i helo.
You know he can't do this.	Waad ogtahay inuusan samayn karin tan.
I wanted to stay here for a while	Waxaan rabay in aan halkan wax yar sii joogo
He had to do it.	Waxa uu ahaa in uu sameeyo.
There is something about that.	Wax baa jira taas.
He did what he had to do.	Wuxuu sameeyay wixii uu samayn lahaa.
I think they like it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jecel yihiin
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
As well.	Iyo sidoo kale.
He had nothing to do with it.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn inuu sidaas ula hadlo.
She did not say why.	Ma aysan sheegin sababta.
I have not come yet.	Weli ma iman.
Really good friend	Runtii saaxiib wanaagsan
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I think that's a lot more	Waxaan filayaa in taasi aad uga badan tahay
I could not find it	Waan heli waayay
To tell it was done.	Si aad ugu sheegto in la sameeyay.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
He looked so bad.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u xun.
They are enough.	Way ku filan yihiin.
That is what it is.	Waa waxa ay tahay.
I am afraid of many, many things	Waxaan ka baqayaa waxyaabo badan, waxyaabo badan
In fact, the best.	Dhab ahaantii, ugu fiican.
What a great.	Maxaa weyn.
I know it would help.	Waan ogahay inay ku caawin lahayd.
He told me he was sorry.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu ka xun yahay.
I don't think that's what you want.	Uma maleynayo inay taasi tahay waxa aad rabto.
I just need to do it	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo
I know where this is	Waan ogahay meesha ay tani tahay
I can't find enough for me.	Ma heli karo wax igu filan.
You know you want it.	Waad ogtahay inaad rabto.
I already knew what had happened	Hore ayaan u ogaa waxa dhacay
I would love to see you again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale arko
I thought that was weird	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay taasi yaab tahay
I know we can do something very interesting	Waan ogahay wax aan samayn karno oo aad u xiiso badan
I have to keep it here at home.	Waa inaan ku hayaa halkan guriga.
I have to find him, now	Waa inaan helo isaga, hadda
I have seen and rejected it before	Waan arkay oo diiday mar hore
I do not know how difficult this is to do	Ma garanayo sida ay tani u adag tahay in la sameeyo
You really can't tell who he is.	Runtii ma sheegi kartid qofka uu yahay.
And I could not help it.	Oo ma caawin karin.
I'm here if you need anything	Waxaan halkan joogaa haddii aad wax u baahan tahay
Even that can be omitted.	Xitaa taas waa laga tagi karaa.
Time will tell.	Waqti ayaa sheegi doona.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
He knew he had done it.	Wuu ogaa inuu sameeyay.
I wonder if he is good.	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii uu fiican yahay.
Not that it was too hard.	Ma aha in ay ahayd mid aad u adag.
I heard you well	si fiican ayaan kuu maqlay
I really wanted him	Aad ayaan u rabay isaga
Still, he is back.	Weli, wuu soo noqday.
I did not see.	Maan arag.
I hope we can be good friends!	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqon karno saaxiibo wanaagsan!
As a real one.	Sida mid dhab ah.
She said she didn't.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay samayn.
Not sure how long it will take	Ma hubo inta ay qaadan doonto
He is still not at home.	Wali guriga ma joogo.
I wonder how much he actually got	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta uu dhab ahaantii helay
I did not want to be eaten	Ma rabin inaan la cuno
All he did was get some food.	Waxa kaliya ee uu sameeyay waxay ahayd inuu helo xoogaa cunto ah.
We would leave	Waanu bixi lahayn
That could be.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa.
I know everything you will say	Waan ogahay wax walba oo aad sheegi doonto
I have something you can help with	Waxaan hayaa wax aad ku caawin karto
This would not always be the case.	Tani mar walba sidaas ma ahaan lahayd.
There are some things you need to do first.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo ay tahay inaad marka hore sameyso.
It would be a long day.	Waxay noqon lahayd maalin dheer.
Hold the room.	Qabo qolka.
I hope you like it too	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay
I would do anything to stay with you	Waxaan sameyn lahaa wax kasta si aan kula joogo
I can help him with that	Taas waan ka caawin karaa isaga
I didn’t want to see you here.	Maan rabin inaan ku arko halkan.
He did it again.	Mar kale ayuu sameeyay.
I was not now.	Anigu hadda maan ahayn.
Lots of good stuff out there	Waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan halkaas
But it is available.	Laakiin waa la heli karaa.
Now that would be something !.	Hadda taasi wax bay noqon lahayd!.
All you have to do is give it a try.	Waxa kaliya ee ay tahay inaad sameyso waa inaad rabto.
I came out.	Waan ka soo baxay.
I hope this helps someone else.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay caawiso qof kale.
Probably not.	Waxay u badan tahay, ma aha.
It is not the same now.	Hadda isku mid maaha.
I have never been anywhere else all the time.	Weligay meel kale ma joogin wakhti kasta.
I don't want a job	Ma rabo shaqo
I love everything you do here	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo aad halkan ku samaysay
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
I don't want it anymore.	Mar dambe ma rabo.
You love him.	Waad jeceshahay isaga.
I want to know if that is true	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado in taasi run tahay
And many other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale oo badan.
I love making new friends	Waxaan jeclahay samaynta saaxiibo cusub
I think he feels the same way	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dareemayo sidaas oo kale
He had a good day.	Maalin wanaagsan ayuu lahaa.
He was like.	Wuxuu ahaa sida.
I got a lot.	Wax badan ayaan helay.
I will be there for a while.	Wax yar ayaan halkaas joogi doonaa.
I'm still sorry for him	Wali waan ka xumahay isaga
And there you have it	Oo halkaas aad ku leedahay
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
It looks like that.	Waxay u egtahay sidaas.
I need your help with that	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad taas ku caawiso
I do this to get out and be with people	Waxaan tan u sameeyaa si aan uga baxo oo aan dadka ula joogo
It has been a difficult day already.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag mar hore.
I spent more time with everyone	Waxaan la qaatay waqti ka badan qof kasta
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
Maybe I would get it too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale heli lahaa.
Good day.	Maalin wanaagsan.
I know there is more to it than me	Waan ogahay inay jiraan wax ka badan aniga
We will do everything together.	Wax walba waan wada sameyn doonaa.
That didn’t do him well.	Taas si fiican uma samayn isaga.
It is an idea formed.	Waa fikrad la sameeyay.
But it looks good.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqdaa mid fiican.
I want you to do the same	Waxaan rabaa inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso
People just left.	Dadka kaliya ayaa tagay.
I hope you like it too	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay
He did not tell anyone	Cidna uma sheegin
Why did he feel that way?	Muxuu sidaas u dareemay.
There was always another problem.	Had iyo jeer waxaa jiray dhib kale.
I have no more.	Ma haysto mar dambe.
I want you to tell them.	Waxaan rabaa inaad u sheegto.
Please give us time on this.	Fadlan waqti na sii arrintan.
See several.	Ku arag dhowr.
It will not be guaranteed.	Ma noqon doonto mid la hubo.
Only often.	Kaliya inta badan.
He said it was not correct.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay sax ahayn.
I do not want money	Ma doonayo lacag
I wanted to see myself	Waxaan rabay inaan is arko
I am on strike	shaqo joojin ayaan ku jiraa
I think that is really beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi runtii aad u qurux badan tahay.
I think.	Waxaan u maleynayaa.
I wanted to do the same	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyo
It was certainly quick to do that.	Hubaal waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah in taas la sameeyo.
I wanted him to leave.	Waxaan rabay inuu baxo.
It sounds complicated, but it is not.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid adag, laakiin maaha.
Me at home.	Aniga guriga.
Not sure how to do this.	Ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
No one helped me.	Qofna ima caawin.
I will get it.	Waan heli doonaa.
I don't want to say.	Ma rabo inuu sheego.
I can tell you where you can find him.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa meesha aad ka heli karto isaga.
I think he can tell you a lot	Waxaan filayaa inuu wax badan kuu sheegi karo
I want that clear.	Waxaan rabaa taas cad.
It can be a lot.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax badan.
I was persistent, and surprisingly fast	Waxaan ahaa mid joogto ah, oo la yaab leh si degdeg ah
They are the same as everyone else.	Waxay la mid yihiin dadka kale.
I can see everything now	Wax walba hadda waan arki karaa
I had to leave home	Waxay ahayd inaan guriga uga tago
There is a door.	Waxaa jira albaabka.
I like to be surprised	Waxaan jeclahay inaan la yaabo
I did not know where she was	Meel ay joogto maan garanayn
There is no place for you here.	Ma jirto meel aad halkan.
I can't tomorrow	Ma awoodo berrito
Not sure? 	Ma hubaa tan?
was asked.	ayaa la waydiiyay.
Something she had never seen before.	Wax aanay hore u arag.
They looked at each other.	Waa la is eegay.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay haysan.
We need more and more.	Waxaan u baahanahay in ka badan iyo in ka badan.
I knew that would happen.	Waan ogaa inay taasi dhici doonto.
I could not help it	Waan ku caawin waayay
Can you believe it?	Ma rumaysan kartaa?.
She said bad things.	Waxyaabo xun bay tidhi.
I had to find it, to help	Waxay ahayd inaan helo, si aan u caawiyo
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
That was a given.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la siiyay.
I may not have another chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan fursad kale helin.
I may not be ready	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan diyaar ahayn
I know more about you than you can imagine	Wax badan ayaan kaa ogahay in ka badan inta aad malayn karto
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry	Waan ka xumahay, aad baan uga xumahay
I think everyone did.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba sameeyay.
I did the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan sameeyay.
I have never succeeded.	Weligay waxba kama aan guulaysan.
You must not lie.	Waa inaadan been ka sheegin.
There is so much that you do not yet understand.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo aadan weli fahmin.
Before they caught me.	Inta aanay i qaban.
Maybe I should say more	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax badan sheego
There was nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la sameeyo ma jirin.
I will be coming soon	waan ku iman doonaa dhawaan
Everything you need is here.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay waa halkan.
She did not pay.	Ma ay bixin.
I would not go anywhere else	Meel kale ma aadi lahaa
I will come out.	Waan soo bixi doonaa.
He is not at home now	Hadda ma joogo guriga
I just need to be let go	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay in la iga tago
I still love it now	Wali waan jeclahay hadda
A man did that, for sure.	Nin ayaa sidaas sameeyay, hubaal.
Everyone knows this.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa tan.
I expect a lot from you	Wax badan ayaan kaa filayaa
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
This is what we need.	Tani waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
I love this and that	Waxaan jeclahay kan iyo kan
I got it now.	Waxa aan helay hadda.
I heard you there.	Halkaas ayaan kugu maqlay.
She says so here.	Waxay sidaas ku leedahay halkan.
I knew what he wanted.	Waan ogaa waxa uu rabo.
I think they will like it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jeclaan doonaan
I have done it before.	Hore ayaan u sameeyay.
But he must have it.	Laakiin waa inuu haysto.
Don't do it.	Ha samayn.
It was a lot of work	Shaqo badan oo ahayd
Even if this is unnecessary.	Xitaa haddii ay tani tahay mid aan loo baahnayn.
But it was tough.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid adag.
I think there is something in this.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax ku jiraan arrintan.
It was taken very seriously.	Aad ayaa loo qaaday.
I tried a lot more.	Waxaan isku dayay wax badan oo kale.
I must not pay you	Waa inaanan lacag ku siin
Still very interesting.	Weli aad u xiiso badan.
I heard what happened at the door	Waxaan maqlay waxa albaabka ka dhacay
I just can't go out	Ma bixi karo oo kaliya
It's bad but now you're an adult.	Waa wax xun laakiin hadda waxaad tahay qofka weyn.
I saw it the same way	Waxaan u arkay si la mid ah
Something will soon be done about what happened to me.	Dhawaan wax ayaa laga qaban doonaa waxa igu dhacay.
I didn't think he felt that way	Uma malaynayn inuu sidaas dareemay
No wonder it does.	La yaab maaha runtii.
He is here now.	Hadda wuu joogaa.
It is very, very difficult.	Aad iyo aad bay u adag tahay.
I should not have known what it was	Ma ahayn inaan ogaado waxay ahayd
You should not think so.	Waa inaadan taas u malayn.
That's what everyone said.	Taasi waa waxa qof kastaa yidhi.
Only the contents were found.	Waxa ku jira oo kaliya ayaa la helay.
I am with you	Waan kula joogaa
I have not done this before	Tan hore uma aan samayn
I decided today	Waxaan go'aansaday maanta
Something in him is not right.	Wax isaga ku jira maaha mid sax ah.
I really did not know what	Runtii maan garanayn waxa
Good friend.	Saaxiib wanaagsan.
We would talk.	Waan hadli lahayn.
I'm sorry I did not want to	Waan ka xumahay inaanan rabin
But it was real.	Laakiin dhab buu ahaa.
This will take time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
This is not an easy task.	Tani dhib yar maaha.
I suspect he may not be there	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in laga yaabo inuusan halkaas joogin
I spent it, well.	Waxaan ku qaatay, si fiican.
He just took it.	Kaliya wuu qaatay.
I need to do this	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan sameeyo
I left early	Waxaan ka baxay hore
They certainly are.	Waa hubaal inay yihiin.
Not that it was too early.	Ma aha in ay ahayd goor hore.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma i caawin karaa.
I think, to do that	Waxaan filayaa, inaan taas sameeyo
He saw.	Wuu arkay.
I thought he did great things	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu sameeyay waxyaabo aad u wanaagsan
I think that is the only thing she really needs	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi tahay waxa kaliya ee ay u baahan tahay runtii
I did not understand correctly	Si sax ah uma fahmin
I could not allow another to come	Ma u ogolaan karin mid kale inuu yimaado
What was in there.	Maxaa meesha ku jiray.
Runtii, really hard.	Runtii, runtii adag.
I knew it for sure	Waxaan u ogaa sida hubaal ah
He could not help me.	Wuu i caawin waayay.
It can be a lot.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax badan.
I could not leave there	Halkaas ayaan uga tagi waayay
It really is.	Waa runtii.
Only one idea.	Hal fikrad kaliya.
I found things to do.	Waxaan helay waxyaabo aan sameeyo.
I hope you can see it better.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad si fiican u arki karto.
I really felt that way.	Runtii sidaas ayaan dareemay.
I would not, I could not, that.	Ma aan samayn lahaa, ma awoodin, taas.
Let him come back.	Ha soo noqdo.
It certainly was.	Waa hubaal inay ahayd.
I have no idea the former.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo kii hore.
I wonder what it took	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ku qaatay
I think that is even better	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi xitaa ka wanaagsan tahay
Seen this done.	Arkay tan la sameeyay.
There was another.	Mid kale ayaa jiray.
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
I am right	run baan ahay
You can see it here.	Waxaad ka arki kartaa halkan.
I can't do that right now	Taas hadda ma qaban karo
I got it now.	Waan helay hadda.
I have not come back now.	Hadda dib uma soo noqon.
Everyone had a great time.	Qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa waqti aad u fiican.
Not everyone can lie	Qof walba been uma sheegi karo
Maybe it will do better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax wanaagsan samayn doonto.
I was very busy today	Maanta aad ayaan mashquul u ahaa
I don't know anything.	Waxba ma garanayo.
I want to stay here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan sii joogo
I started school late	Waxaan bilaabay dugsiga goor dambe
I still can't see anyone	Wali qofna maan arki karin
I really say so	Runtii aad baan u leeyahay
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
I used to do that	sidaas ayaan u samayn jiray
Someone else did.	Qof kale ayaa sidaas sameeyay.
It really is.	Dhab ahaantii waa.
I will always be here.	Had iyo jeer halkan ayaan joogi doonaa.
You can't do better.	Wax ka fiican ma samayn kartid.
No one knows him.	Qofna ma garanayo isaga.
I had to help you	Waxay ahayd inaan ku caawiyo
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
Really long time.	Runtii waqti aad u dheer.
One I did not.	Mid aan samayn.
I want to go to the room, just by myself	Waxaan rabaa inaan tago qolka, aniga kaliya
That was who she was, what she did.	Taasi waxay ahayd qofka ay ahayd, waxa ay samaysay.
Probably nothing else.	Malaha wax kale.
I do not want to	Maan rabin
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
I don't mind that.	Dhib igama qabo taas.
I would see that.	Waan arki lahaa taas.
All great man	Nin weyn oo dhan
I said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
They must be helped.	Waa in la caawiyo.
There is a little more than that.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo ka badan taas.
He did it all.	Wuu wada sameeyay.
I know you want to eat together	Waan ogahay inaad rabto inaad hal mar wada cunto
She did not want to lie.	Ma ay rabin in ay been sheegto.
But we will see.	Laakiin waan arki doonaa.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
I am still with you	Wali waan kuu joogaa
He said something else.	Wax kale ayuu yiri.
I knew she would do it	Waan ogaa inay samayn doonto
I did not think otherwise	Si kale uma malaynayn
I spent a lot of time here	Waqti badan ayaa halkan ku qaatay
I pulled out everything that was interesting	Waxaan kala soo baxay wax kasta oo xiiso u lahaa
He seemed very small.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u yar.
Something else is coming.	Wax kale ayaa soo socda.
I can't do that, you know.	Taas ma samayn karo, waad ogtahay.
Let me tell you something you may not know.	Aan kuu sheego wax laga yaabo inaadan ogeyn.
Not so here.	Halkan sidaas maaha.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
They will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doonaan.
Lots of similar things.	Waxyaabo badan oo la mid ah.
I would like to keep it that way	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sidaas ku sii hayo
I told him they didn't need that.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay taas u baahnayn.
I thought it was you	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga
In fact, they probably have no idea who he is.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay u badan tahay in aanay wax fikrad ah ka haysan cidda uu yahay.
You will have a really good time.	Waxaad heli doontaa wakhti fiican runtii.
People.	Dadka.
I would stay here again	Waxaan sii joogi lahaa halkan mar kale
I will soon be very big	Waxaan dhawaan noqon doonaa mid aad u weyn
You can't stop.	Ma joojin kartid.
I will always love him.	Had iyo jeer waan jeclaan doonaa isaga.
But he still hasn't got it.	Laakiin weli ma uusan helin.
I'm afraid to leave	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan baxo
It can be anyone.	Wuxuu noqon karaa qof kasta.
I will come to you soon	waan kuu iman doonaa dhawaan
Maybe it's the same now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hadda la mid tahay.
I knew she would do that	Waan ogaa inay taasi samayn doonto
That would be something he would love.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax uu jeclaan karo.
I came back to help	Dib baan u soo noqday si aan u caawiyo
I did enough damage as it is	Dhib igu filan ayaan sameeyay sida ay tahay
Not everyone did.	Qof kastaa ma samayn.
I think he should come with me.	Waxay ila tahay inuu ila yimaado.
I knew that was true.	Waan ogaa in taasi run tahay.
Three times I refused.	Saddex jeer ayaan diiday.
I know that.	Waan ogahay in.
I can see he is not in a good place.	Waxaan arki karaa inuusan ku jirin meel wanaagsan.
I can't tell you what he did	Uma sheegi karo waxa uu sameeyay
I know you don't understand why.	Waan ogahay inaadan fahmin sababta.
I should have told you that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas kuu sheego
I wonder if it will help me	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay i caawin doonto
I was left for a very long time	Muddo aad u dheer ayaa la iga tagay
Shortly afterwards he left	Wax yar ka dib wuu ka tagay
He did not want to see her again.	Ma uusan rabin inuu mar dambe arko.
I had no money	Wax lacag ah maan haysan
I don't see anything else we can do now	Ma arko wax kale oo aan hadda samayn karno
I need to go to work	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqada aado
I thought you wanted to help.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto inaad caawiso.
I am very happy to be a part of it	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ka mid noqdo
I have no one.	Qofna ma hayo.
He looked at us.	Wuu na eegay.
It would help.	Wuu caawin lahaa.
I know he doesn't want to stay there	Waan ogahay inuusan jeclayn inuu halkaas sii joogo
Mostly it is me.	Inta badan waa aniga.
I do not have to know this	Ma aha inaan tan ogaado
More than this.	Wax badan tan.
Now I do not know if that is true or not	Hadda ma garanayo inay taasi run tahay iyo in kale
I would definitely be here again.	Dhab ahaantii halkan mar kale ayaan joogi lahaa.
I knew that would happen	Waan ogaa inay taasi dhici doonto
I tried to help	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ku caawiyo
That is a lot really.	Taasi waa wax aad u badan run ahaantii.
But only.	Laakiin kaliya.
I had the opportunity to work with him for three years.	Waxaan fursad u helay inaan la shaqeeyo muddo saddex sano ah.
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
I had to learn that hard	Waxay ahayd inaan taas u barto si adag
I want to work	Waxaan rabaa inaan shaqeeyo
I took it back and looked at him.	Waxaan dib u qaaday oo eegay isaga.
I will never leave home	Weligay guriga kama bixi doono
I am very serious.	Aad baan u dhab ahay.
You are too much.	Aad baad u badan tahay.
I just did not know how long it would take	Kaliya ma aan garanayn inta ay qaadan doonto
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa .
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
I know you love me now	Waan ogahay inaad i jeceshahay hadda
I used to cook for him	Waxaan u karin jiray isaga
I hope you are like that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas tahay
I tried not to leave anything out	Waxaan isku dayay inaan waxba ka tagin
He should not have.	Ma ahayn inuu haysto.
He did not see the next one.	Ma uusan arag soo socda.
I look forward to seeing you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan arko.
Do not say so.	Ha u hadlin sidaas.
Everyone had the same opportunity	Qof kastaa wuxuu helay fursad isku mid ah
We will do this for you if you want	Taas waan kuu samayn doonaa haddii aad rabto
I did not say.	Ma odhan.
I took that	Taas waan ka qaaday
It is too good to be true.	Aad buu u fiican yahay inuu run noqdo.
I can do that, adult	Taas waan samayn karaa, qof weyn
But it was very interesting.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I should have seen this	Waxay ahayd inaan tan arko
I had to tell him more	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan u sheego
I did the right thing	Waxaan sameeyay wax sax ah
I have no idea how big they are when they are new	Wax fikrad ah kama helin sida ay u weyn yihiin marka ay cusub yihiin
Nothing would be the same anymore.	Wax mar dambe isku mid ahaan lahaa ma jiraan.
It was amazing, he thought.	Waxay ahayd wax aad yaab leh, ayuu u maleeyay.
In like a day.	In sida maalin.
You don't have to do anything.	Ma aha inaad wax samayso.
I wondered why.	Waxaan la yaabay sababta.
I can't say who.	Ma sheegi karo cidda.
I thought he was.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ahaa.
It won't do much.	Wax badan ma yeeli doonto.
It will take time, but it must be done.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti, laakiin waa in la sameeyaa.
He tried to stay in everything.	Waxa uu isku dayay in uu ku sii jiro wax walba.
And here it was.	Oo halkan waxay ahayd.
It is too long here.	Aad bay u dheer tahay halkan.
I think she will love it	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas jeclaan doonto
Maybe I didn't like it	Malaha ma jeclayn
I want to leave here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ka baxo
I refused	waan diiday
I thought it would help if you did not believe me	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ku caawin doonto haddii aadan i rumaysan
I did	waan sameeyay
I just do	Kaliya waan sameeyaa
I want more	wax badan ayaan rabaa
I think that was the reason	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd sababta
I looked up and started to break up	Waan eegay oo waxaan bilaabay inaan kala tago
I have something to say	waxaan leeyahay wax aan sheego
I say to you.	waan ku leeyahay.
I know he taught something at school	Waan ogahay inuu wax ka dhigay dugsiga
There is something everywhere.	Meel walba wax baa jira.
I used to be	Mar baan ku ahaan jiray
But this was not surprising.	Laakiin tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
Not so.	Sidaas ma aha.
I have to go to work	Waa in aan shaqada tago
I went to see	Waxaan u baxay inaan arko
I have never had it before	Weligay taas ka hor ma helin
I think we can do it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan sameyn karno
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
Sure, there is really nothing else going on.	Waa hubaal, ma jiraan runtii wax kale oo socda.
I know this is a bad time	Waan ogahay in tani ay tahay waqti xun
I think it is beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inuu qurux badan yahay
Really need it	Runtii u baahan
She could not leave.	Way ka bixi wayday.
I think he is now.	Waxaan filayaa inuu hadda joogo.
Everything you said is true.	Wax kasta oo aad sheegtay waa run.
Do something about it now.	Hadda wax ka qabo.
But, what was there still exists.	Laakiin, wixii jiray ayaa weli jira.
Let's not say it is.	Aan odhan waa.
Maybe he's sorry.	Malaha wuu ka xumahay.
But someone else did.	Laakiin qof kale ayaa sameeyay.
I still haven't found it.	Wali maan helin.
I still can't believe you did that	Wali ma rumaysan karo inaad taas samaysay
Maybe she said something.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax tidhi.
I do not want you.	Ma rabo inaad.
You told me it was too fast.	Waxaad ii sheegtay in ay aad u degdeg badan tahay.
He does not have to know.	Ma aha inuu ogaado.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
He is the same man.	Waa isku nin.
I have to leave	waa inaan baxo
He fell for school.	Dugsiga wuu ku dhacay.
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
But he was in trouble.	Laakiin dhib buu ku jiray.
I wonder what will happen to me	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa igu dhici doona
I never thought it would take so long	Weligay ma malaynayn in ay qaadan doonto waqti dheer
It would be great.	Aad bay u fiicnaan lahayd.
He said to himself tomorrow.	Berri ayuu is yidhi.
Everything is new here.	Wax walba halkan waa ku cusub yihiin.
I do not know more than you	Maan garanayn wax ka badan adiga
He is a person.	Waa qof.
She did it for him.	Waxay u samaysay isaga.
But she hasn’t got it, yet.	Laakiin ma aysan helin, weli.
I can see that now.	Taas hadda waan arki karaa.
It is true that not everyone understands that.	Waa run in qof kastaa aanu taas fahmin.
Maybe I should have.	Malaha waxay ahayd inaan ahaan lahaa.
I can't lie.	Been ma sheegi karo.
Maybe he went somewhere and came back.	Malaha meel ayuu u baxay oo soo noqday.
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
I told you it would happen.	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay dhici doonto.
I will never do it for him	Weligay ma yeeli doono isaga
I have to be with him	Waa inaan la joogaa isaga
I thought it was just	Waxaan u maleeyay inay kaliya ahayd
We would get him now.	Waanu heli lahayn isaga hadda.
I haven't been there in a while	In muddo ah maan tagin
It's not just what it looks like.	Kaliya maaha sida ay u egtahay.
I can really do that	Runtii taas waan samayn karaa
I just want to know why you did this	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta aad tan u samaysay
But, a little, she did.	Laakiin, in yar, way samaysay.
A little similar	Wax yar oo la mid ah
I did not speak.	Maan la hadlin.
I was always at work.	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa shaqada.
I want to eat	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax cuno
Definitely like you, too.	Dhab ahaantii adiga oo kale, sidoo kale.
They are all good.	Way wada fiican yihiin.
Not now, not here.	Hadda maaha, halkan maaha.
But no one can tell what to do.	Laakiin qofna uma sheegi karo waxa la sameeyo.
Don't lie to me again.	Mar dambe been ha ii sheegin.
It is not certain that this is always true.	Lama hubo inay taasi had iyo jeer run tahay.
But he could not see.	Laakiin wuu arki waayay.
I could not leave	Waan ka tagi waayay
I know how to get out	Waan ogahay sida loo baxo
I want to know what happened	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
I did not do this	Anigu ma aan samayn tan
he thought.	wuxuu mooday.
There must be something else, he thought.	Waa in ay jirto si kale, ayuu u maleeyay.
I can do something here for a while	Waxaan wax ka qaban karaa halkan in muddo ah
That is exactly what is needed.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan waxa loo baahan yahay.
I want more than anything	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan wax kasta
did nothing, really.	waxba ma samayn, runtii.
No one is happy.	Qof faraxsan ma jiro.
But it is still difficult to leave here.	Laakiin weli way adag tahay in halkan laga tago.
But it should.	Laakiin waa inay.
I can not say so	Ma odhan karo sidaas oo kale
It is not a car seen.	Ma aha baabuur la arkay.
You do not want to, but you will.	Ma rabto, laakiin waad sameyn doontaa.
He went there today to get it.	Maanta ayuu halkaas u aaday si uu u helo.
Not now, not tomorrow.	Hadda maaha, berri maaha.
Started.	Bilaabay.
I really didn't think he would do that	Run ahaantii uma malaynayn inuu taas samayn doono
She should know that.	Waa inay taas ogaato.
There must be some strange things going on there.	Waa inay jiraan waxyaabo yaab leh oo halkaas ka socda.
Please, you must	Fadlan, waa inaad
There is nothing better than this.	Ma jiro wax ka fiican kan.
First of all, that is a good thing.	Marka hore, taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
But how.	Laakiin sidee.
Very big and close to seeing	Mid aad u weyn oo uu ku dhow yahay inuu arko
It is very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
I just want to talk to you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
Somewhere.	Meel la joogo.
I know what this means for you.	Waan ogahay waxa ay tani adiga kugu tahay.
As such, it is missing.	Sidaas oo kale, waa la waayay.
I did not want to be anywhere else	Ma rabin inaan meel kale joogo
He knew everything.	Wax walba wuu ogaa.
He is very smart.	Aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay.
New	Cusub
I did not know about you	Taas adiga kaa maan ogeyn
She told him.	Way u sheegtay.
We will discuss it later.	Dib ayaan ka wada hadli doonaa.
I did not see anything	Waxba maan arag
That is because he could not.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah wuu awoodi waayay.
Maybe not good.	Malaha wax wanaagsan maaha.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
Everywhere.	Meel walba.
I just want to see it again	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale arko
It was something in me.	Waxay ahayd wax igu jira.
I really liked him	Runtii aad baan uga helay isaga
One bigger.	Mid ka weyn.
I was here with friends	Waxaan la joogay halkan saaxiibo
I still can't see.	Wali ma arki karo.
He had a new and good one.	Mid cusub oo wanaagsan ayuu lahaa.
You are an adult	Waxaad tahay qof ka weyn
I can do it tomorrow	Waan samayn karaa berri
No one really likes being told what to do.	Qofna runtii ma jecla in loo sheego waxa la samaynayo.
I can't let you tell them	Ma ogolaan karo inaad u sheegto
All is ready.	Dhammaan waa diyaar.
There is no one else for me.	Ma jiro qof kale aniga.
I should have been here	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaan joogo
You know, that's great to say.	Waad ogtahay, taasi waa wax weyn inuu qof sheego.
I know this is difficult.	Waan ogahay in tani ay adag tahay.
I can afford a little	Wax yar ayaan bixin karaa
You are lucky, really.	Nasiib baad leedahay, runtii.
I will not go back.	Dib ugu noqon maayo.
I had to leave immediately	Waxay ahayd inaan degdeg uga baxo meesha
I did not take it well	Si fiican uma qaadan
I did not want to do it	Ma aanan rabin in aan sameeyo
I think it looks great	Waxaan filayaa inay u egtahay mid aad u fiican
I think he would tell you	Waxaan u malayn lahaa inuu kuu sheegi lahaa
I will not lie to you	Been kuu sheegi maayo
He said it would never happen.	Wuxuu sheegay inuusan waligiis waxba noqon doonin.
The reason for this was a person.	Sababta tani waxay ahayd qof.
That is an interesting place to be.	Taasi waa meel xiiso leh in la joogo.
I need that.	Taas ayaan u baahanahay.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
But it is good.	Laakiin way fiican tahay.
Everyone is very happy to work with	Qof kastaa aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay inuu la shaqeeyo
I think she can do whatever she wants	Waxaan filayaa inay samayn karto waxay doonto
I have a car	Baabuur baan hayaa
I can tell there.	Waxaan u sheegi karaa halkaas.
I can see well.	Waxaan si fiican wax u arki karaa.
Always wondered what it could be.	Had iyo jeer la yaabay waxa ay noqon karto.
This was awful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
They still do that.	Weli taas way sameeyaan.
That really was.	Taasi runtii waxay ahayd.
It’s the only time he’s going to be so bad.	Waa marka kaliya ee uu noqon doono mid aad u xun.
I have to leave him	Waa inaan isaga tago isaga
I don't think it is.	U malayn maayo inay tahay.
She could not find this.	Waxay ka heli weyday tan.
He needs to be.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu noqdo.
He has already returned.	Mar hore ayuu soo noqday.
I would like to see one	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko mid
I don't have to talk to him	Ma aha inaan la hadlo isaga
I hope you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad.
Not as often as he wanted.	Ma aha inta jeer ee uu rabay.
Not if you really like him.	Ma aha haddii aad si dhab ah isaga jeceshahay.
He can talk.	Wuu hadli karaa.
It was quick.	Waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
It will definitely get better now.	Hubaal hadda way fiicnaan doontaa.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan.
It may not really be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay dhab ahaan ahayn.
I hope to see you soon.	Waxaan filayaa inaan dhawaan arki doono.
He did amazing things.	Waxyaabo yaab leh ayuu sameeyay.
You would hardly believe it.	Si dhib ah uma aad rumaysan lahayd.
He can get away with anything.	Wax walba wuu ka bixi karaa.
It was something new.	Waxay ahayd wax cusub.
No one is present.	Qofna ma joogo.
There is no place greater than where we live.	Ma jirto meel ka weyn meesha aan ku nool nahay.
He is a very beautiful and intelligent person.	Waa qof aad u qurux badan oo caqli badan.
I want to be something	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax noqdo
For a while.	Muddo yar.
I just couldn't help it	Kaliya waan caawin waayay
I have a job tomorrow	Berri shaqo ayaan u hayaa
I can see everything	Wax walba waan arki karaa
This is done here.	Tan ayaa halkan lagu sameeyay.
But that’s not all we do.	Laakiin ma aha waxa aan samayno oo dhan.
You will see beautiful things, that is a given.	Waxaad arki doontaa waxyaabo qurux badan, taasi waa wax la siiyay.
Nothing left the room.	Ma jiro wax qolka ka baxay.
I also found awful things as well	Waxaan sidoo kale helay waxyaabo aad u xun sidoo kale
I have not come yet.	Wali ma iman.
I should have told you	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu sheego
I think the same thing could happen now	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi la mid ah dhici karto hadda
I am not yet.	Wali ma ihi.
A better man.	Nin ka wanaagsan.
I need him, very, very much	Waxaan u baahanahay isaga, si aad iyo aad u badan
I think that's what you said	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay waxaad tidhi
Best of all, really.	Ugu fiican, dhab ahaantii.
I saw what he was doing.	Waxaan arkay waxa uu samaynayo.
This may be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa run.
She said it was as she wanted	Waxay tidhi waa sida ay rabto
I think he loves you	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu ku jecel yahay
I have to do another one	Waa inaan mid kale sameeyaa
Maybe that's why she did it.	Malaha waa sababta ay u samaysay.
Something to talk about.	Wax laga hadlo.
Nothing came in	Wax soo galay ma jirin
I really love you	si dhab ah ayaan kuu jeclahay
I really have no idea what he will do	Runtii wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa uu samayn doono
I have no idea how he got it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida uu ku helay
I can see that now.	Taas hadda waan arki karaa.
I knew what was going on	Waan ogaa waxa ku socda
He could not leave the house immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayuu guriga uga bixi waayay.
I know he will be here	Waan ogahay inuu halkaan joogi doono
You really will.	Runtii waad yeeli doontaa.
Lots to learn.	Waxyaabo badan oo la barto.
He does not want to know.	Ma rabo inuu ogaado.
Very well known.	Aad baa loo yaqaan.
I think it would be a big deal	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan lahayd wax weyn oo weyn
I wanted to.	Waxaan rabay.
I heard someone coming	Waxaan maqlay qof soo socda
Someone was there.	Qof baa meesha joogay.
I don't have to be here.	Ma ahan inaan halkaan joogo.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
I felt like I had fallen	Waxaan dareemay inaan dhacay
But it was never done.	Laakiin waligiis lama samayn.
I am ready as expected	waan diyaar sida la rabo
Great man, great man	Nin weyn, nin weyn
I think things are going well	Waxaan filayaa inay wax u fiican yihiin
We would not do otherwise.	Si kale ma yeeli lahayn.
One more time.	Hal mar oo kale.
I knew he would never hurt me	Waan ogaa inuusan waligiis i yeeli doonin
I did not want to talk about it	Maan rabin inaan ka hadlo
Not really a big deal.	Runtii wax weyn maaha.
I can be tough	Waxaan noqon karaa mid adag
I think that's a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi tahay fikrad fiican.
I think you can do worse	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad wax ka sii xun samayn karto
I do not know what happened, to this day	Ma garanayo waxa dhacay, ilaa maanta
I just didn't like him	Kaliya maan jeclayn isaga
But he wanted to.	Laakiin wuu rabay.
I have no idea where she is	Meel ay joogto wax fikrad ah uma hayo
I am serious	dhab baan ahay
Give it to me.	I sii.
I looked around the house	Waxaan dib ugu eegay guriga
It will be.	Waxay noqon doontaa.
You will be fine	Waad fiicnaan doontaa
I heard about it later	Mar dambe ayaan ka maqlay
Only now.	Kaliya hadda.
I do everything bad, everything	Waxaan sameeyaa wax kasta oo xun, wax walba
Lots of fun.	Wax badan oo xiiso leh.
Someone who loves me and says	Qof i jecel oo sheegtay
I don't want a problem here	Ma doonayo dhibaato halkan
That is to be found.	Taas oo ah in la helo.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
There is something else to do.	Waxaa jira wax kale oo la sameeyo.
There is very little	Wax aad u yar ma jiro
Probably me.	Malaha aniga.
But that is the only reason.	Laakiin taasi waa sababta kaliya.
We can no longer do it.	Mar dambe ma samayn karno.
It is a difficult place to work.	Waa meel adag in laga shaqeeyo.
If you don't, don't do it.	Haddii aadan samayn, ha samayn.
More than he was.	In ka badan sidii uu ahaa.
Not yet, but soon.	Weli ma aha, laakiin dhawaan.
I will give you this.	Waxaan ku siin doonaa kan.
You will do it.	Waad samayn doontaa.
I have been with him for almost three years	Waxaan la joogay hore muddo ku dhow saddex sano
I love you so much	Aad baan kuu jeclahay
We are like everyone else.	Waxaan la mid nahay dadka kale.
I can see that for you	Taas waan ku arki karaa adiga
It is obvious.	Waa wax iska cad.
I did not know	Maan ogayn
You may not see how, but it is done.	Ma arki kartid sida, laakiin waa la sameeyaa.
I hope you will do the same	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto
I got enough and I did.	Waxaan helay ku filan oo aan sameeyo.
But they did not understand much.	Laakiin wax badan ma ay fahmin.
Maybe you can get a chance there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad halkaas fursad ka heli karto.
Give yourself some time.	Waqti yar sii.
This had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in tan la sameeyo.
I think it is nothing	Waxaan u malaynayaa in aanay waxba ahayn
I can't believe she will do that	Ma rumaysan karo inay taas samayn doonto
I'm sure he did.	Waan hubaa inuu sameeyay.
Now you will definitely go home and leave.	Hadda waxaad dhab ahaantii aadi doontaa guriga oo aad ka bixi doontaa.
I could not say well	Maan si fiican u odhan karin
You don't have to lie about it.	Ma aha in aad ka been sheegto.
I was surprised she liked me	Waxaan la yaabay inay i jeceshahay
I know you are there	Waan ogahay inaad halkaas joogto
It was beautiful, really.	Waxay ahayd qurux, runtii.
Someone like you.	Qofka dadka la mid ah adiga.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
Everyone is very happy.	Qof kastaa aad buu ugu faraxsan yahay.
But he was.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa.
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
I found this interesting	Waxaan ka helay taas mid xiiso leh
She is fine tonight	Way ku fiican tahay caawa
Someone else has to do it.	Qof kale waa inuu sidaas sameeyaa.
And looked.	Oo eegay.
That was great to do.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican inay sameeyaan.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
It really can't be.	Dhab ma noqon karto.
But no luck.	Laakiin nasiib ma leh.
He could do nothing.	Waxba wuu qaban waayay.
I wanted to stay home	Waxaan rabay inaan guriga joogo
That is what you need.	Taasi waa waxa aad u baahan tahay.
I heard several people went missing	Waxaan maqlay dhowr qof oo la waayay meel la’aan
It still is	Wali waa
But there were no apparent problems.	Laakiin ma jirin wax dhibaato ah oo u muuqday.
There is something there.	Meesha wax baa ka jira.
I have nothing bad.	Wax xun ma hayo.
How could that be he did not know, but he did.	Sidee taasi noqon kartaa ma uusan ogeyn, laakiin wuu sameeyay.
This will end.	Tani way dhammaan doontaa.
It was close.	Waxay ahayd mid dhow.
What happened.	Maxaa dhacay.
She was not a friend.	Ma aysan ahayn saaxiib.
Now I see.	Hadda aan arko.
I want you to know him.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato isaga.
They need to be told.	Waxay u baahan yihiin in la sheego.
It’s something you do.	Waa wax aad sameyso.
I think it's very close	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u dhow
I did not want to see	Maan rabin inaan arko
Maybe I would get it	Malaha waan heli lahaa
We will need every man we can find.	Waxaan u baahan doonaa nin kasta oo aan heli karno.
It should not be a problem.	Waa in aysan dhib lahayn.
It can stay.	Way joogi kartaa.
I just can't do that	Kaliya taas ma sameyn karo
She did not lie.	Been ma aysan sheegin.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I have never seen him so bad.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo xun.
A better man.	Nin ka wanaagsan.
Maybe even better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xitaa ka sii fiican.
I had no real idea of ​​the place	Maan lahayn fikrad dhab ah meesha
Certainly not.	Waxa hubaal ah in aanu yeeli doonin.
He knows where to find you.	Meel uu kaa heli karo wuu garanayaa.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
I already knew	Hore ayaan u ogaa
I can do anything for everyone.	Wax walba waan u samayn karaa qof walba.
Now I got it	Hadda waan helay
And everything else.	Iyo wax kasta oo kale.
That will stop.	Taasi way joojin doontaa.
I can do better here	si fiican ayaan halkan wax uga qaban karaa
I think that's right.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi sax tahay.
I would like you to stay with us	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad nala joogto
I can't make everyone do what they want	Ma yeeli karo in qof walba uu sameeyo waxa uu rabo
It's right here for everything we do every day.	Waa sax halkan wax kasta oo aan samayno maalin kasta.
I wish I was here friend	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaan joogo saaxiib
I hope you will do well	Waxaan filayaa inaad si fiican u samayn doonto
I wonder why he came back here	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu halkan ku soo noqday
But it has to be done.	Laakiin waa in la sameeyaa.
I should not have known	Ma ahayn inaan ogaado
This is also not true.	Tani sidoo kale run maaha.
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan meesha ka baxo
It could not be found	Waa la heli waayay
I know that no one gave me anything	Waan ogahay in aan qofna wax iga siin
Everything is interesting, so is this.	Wax walba waa mid xiiso leh, sidaas oo kale waa kan.
I don't understand that.	Ma fahmin taas.
Lots of time really	Waqti badan runtii
I will never see you in the same way.	Weligay ku arki maayo si la mid ah.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
I decided to do this	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan tan sameeyo
But that cannot happen.	Laakiin taasi ma dhici karto.
I would leave	Waan ka bixi lahaa
I should not have stayed, really	Ma ahayn inaan joogo, dhab ahaantii
I left nothing	Waxba maan tagin
I will not say anything else	Wax kale ma odhan doono
I never did that.	Weligay taas ma samayn.
He just did.	Kaliya wuu sameeyay.
I still didn't know anything about him, really.	Wali waxba kama garanayn isaga, runtii.
I wanted to go home earlier	Waxaan rabay inaan guriga aado mar hore
I can help with that	Taas waan ku caawin karaa
And very beautiful.	Oo aad u qurux badan.
But it may do more.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax badan qaban karto.
I am very skeptical.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
Many things are good.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa fiican.
But she could not.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday.
Now I know what to do	Hadda waan garanayaa waxaan sameeyo
I really want to get to know you	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ku barto
I wanted to know	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado
I have something you want	waxaan hayaa wax aad rabto
I did it once.	Hal mar ayaan sameeyay.
I should not have come back to you	Ma ahayn inaan kuu soo noqdo
I just did	Kaliya waan sameeyay
It will not hurt.	Waxba ka yeeli maayo.
Not like every day.	Ma aha sida maalin kasta.
I did not think anything good would come of it	Uma malaynayn in wax wanaagsan uu ka iman doono
This is probably not what you want.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn waxaad rabto.
I will not be good there, he said.	Anigu halkaas kuma fiicnaan doono, ayuu yidhi.
I have seen and heard everything	Wax walba waan arkay oo maqlay
I know he said that	Waan ogahay in uu sidaas sheegtay
I want to talk to you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
I used to be a happy person.	Waxaan ahaan jiray qof faraxsan.
I hope you don't want to.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaadan rabin.
I should never have left.	Ma ahayn inaan weligay ka bixin.
He just wasn't.	Kaliya ma uusan ahayn.
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
He was very interesting to be with.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan inuu la joogo.
please	fadlan
I didn't think they were very good.	Uma malaynayn inay aad u wanaagsan yihiin.
Today, that does not exist now.	Maanta, taasi hadda ma jirto.
You did not want anything.	Waxba ma aadan rabin.
There is no way you can do this.	Ma jirto si aad tan u samayn lahayd.
It will not go away for a long time	Ma tagi doono waqti dheer
Now it is you.	Hadda waa adiga.
Something was seen.	Wax baa la arkay.
That is correct.	Taas oo sax ah.
I knew something was wrong	Waxaan ogaa in wax aan sax ahayn
It was nothing new.	Wax cusub ma ahayn.
I can talk, but I can't talk anymore	Waan la hadli karaa, laakiin dib uma hadli karo
I can't do everything.	Wax walba ma awoodo.
I did not want to do that.	Ma rabin in aan taas sameeyo.
Now it is.	Hadda waa.
That's right.	Waa sax.
He is with me.	Wuu ila joogaa.
I can't see anything.	Waxba ma arko.
It was a bad idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
I liked it and thought it was better than that	Waan ka helay oo waxaan mooday inay taas ka wanaagsan tahay
That has something, really.	Taasi waxay leedahay wax, dhab ahaantii.
I want to find something real	Waxaan rabaa inaan helo wax dhab ah
Of course, that is not true.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi run maaha.
As you can get.	Sida aad heli karto.
I could not see.	Maan arki karin.
There was nothing to talk about.	Ma jirin wax laga hadlo.
I do not know what to do	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo
In fact, very large.	Dhab ahaantii, aad u weyn.
Good thing.	Wax wanaagsan.
I did not return.	Kuma soo noqon.
Now it must.	Hadda waa inay.
I really had to get this.	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan tan helo.
I did not want to lie to him	Ma rabin inaan been u sheego
She is fine now.	Hadda way fiican tahay.
I do not want to know anything	Ma rabo inaan wax ogaado
I just need to get there	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas tago
You can love him.	Waad jeclaan kartaa isaga.
I would like to stay home	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan guriga la joogo
That is really good.	Taasi runtii waa fiican tahay.
It's out.	Waa laga baxay.
It's still great.	Weli way weyn tahay.
I really like it here	Runtii waan jeclahay halkan
I still do not know.	Wali ma garanayo.
He was a handsome white man.	Nin cad oo qurux badan ayuu u ahaa.
I had so much.	Waxaan lahaa wax aad u badan.
And there was nothing I could not do.	Oo ma jirin wax aan samayn karin.
You know you can do it.	Waad ogtahay inaad samayn karto.
Do not let him leave me.	Ha u ogolaan inuu iga tago.
I couldn’t see much, but it was enough for me	Wax badan ma arki karin, laakiin way igu filan tahay
Stop this, stop that.	Jooji tan, jooji taas.
I know why he did it.	Waan ogahay sababta uu sidaas u sameeyay.
I was ready to see	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan arko
I didn't want to talk about it	Ma rabin inaan ka hadlo
I have never seen that.	Weligay taas ma arag.
I may not do that	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan taas samayn
This will help you to like it.	Tani waxay kaa caawin doontaa inaad jeceshahay.
You will see.	Waad arki doontaa.
I can really see him	Waxaan si dhab ah u arki karaa isaga
As needed.	Sida loo baahan yahay.
I love you so much every day	Maalin walba aad ayaan kuu jeclahay
She was not one of us.	Ma aysan ahayn mid naga mid ah.
I may not give it a chance	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan fursad u siin
You love money.	Waxaad jeceshahay lacag.
I thought you would do the same	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad sidaas oo kale samayn doonto
But she was right.	Laakiin sax bay ahayd.
But he said he would not come.	Laakiin waxa uu sheegay in aanu iman doonin.
This is new.	Tani waa mid cusub.
I didn't think it was really beautiful	Uma malaynayn inuu runtii qurux badan yahay
I found it smart.	Waxaan u arkay inay caqli badan tahay.
Not true	Run maaha
I don't have a job right now	Hadda ma haysto shaqo
I never did that	Weligay taas ma samayn
But often it is not.	Laakiin inta badan maaha.
We will go wherever you want.	Waxaan tagi doonaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
No one can do it here to help you.	Ma jiro qof halkan ku samayn karo si uu ku caawiyo.
That's how he felt.	Sidaas ayuu dareemay.
What came out was not a good idea.	Waxa soo baxay ma ahayn fikrad wanaagsan.
What will happen? 	Maxaa dhici doona?
Well done.	Si wanaagsan.
Really, I really tried	Runtii, runtii waan isku dayay
And not only that.	Oo kaliya ma aha.
It was just that.	Waxay ahayd tan kaliya.
I hope he doesn't see me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan i arag
I went to see	Waxaan u baxay inaan arko
I think it is something everyone knows.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay qof qof kastaa ogaado.
I did not want to see him again.	Ma rabin inaan mar kale arko.
It looks like it could be.	Waxay u egtahay inay noqon karto.
I would love to see it	Waxaan aad u jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
No one has given him anything now.	Qofna hadda isaga waxba kama siin.
She said it would hurt.	Waxay sheegtay inay wax yeeli doonto.
I was not allowed to go	Waa la ii diiday inaan tago
He needs you.	Wuu kuu baahan yahay.
I can easily believe it.	Si dhib yar ayaan u rumaysan karaa.
I went to the exit	Waxaan u aaday meesha laga baxo
I'm really happy	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I think he is in trouble	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu dhib ku jiro
It is really beautiful for me.	Runtii way ii qurux badan tahay.
I am very happy to be back	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku soo noqdo
But then, it was just great.	Laakiin ka dib, waxa ay ahayd oo kaliya weyn.
I can't stay here for long	Ma joogi karo halkan waqti dheer
Very good, too	Mid aad u fiican, sidoo kale
This is, you guessed it.	Tani waa, waxaad u malaynaysaa.
It is difficult to learn.	Waa mid adag in la barto.
That should be sufficient enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
Now he was fine.	Hadda waxa uu ahaa mid wanaagsan.
It was probably the same at home.	Waxay u badan tahay inay isku mid ahayd guriga.
I did not think it would be a problem	Uma malaynayn inay dhibaato noqon doonto
Also there.	Sidoo kale halkaas.
There is everything.	Waxaa jira wax kasta oo jira.
I looked back	Dib baan u eegay
I am invisible enough to do this.	Waxaan ahay mid aan la arki karin oo ku filan inaan tan sameeyo.
I should never have come.	Ma ahayn inaan weligay iman.
I tried to do better than before.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sameeyo si ka wanaagsan sidii hore.
I did not think that could happen	Uma malaynayn inay taasi dhici karto
I could not see what he was doing	Waxa uu samaynayo maan arki karin
I just left	hadda waan ka tagay
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
Really seen.	Runtii arkay.
I got that, but he wanted me to	Waan helay taas, laakiin wuu iga rabay adiga
I can talk to him about anything	Wax kasta waan kala hadli karaa isaga
A white man would always be a white man	Nin cad ayaa waligiis ahaan lahaa nin cad
If you are here, if you are in the room, we need you.	Haddii aad halkan joogto, haddii aad qolka ku jirto, waanu kuu baahanahay.
I think that is what he wants.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay tahay waxa uu rabo.
I just took enough	Wax igu filan oo kaliya ayaan qaatay
But it was not.	Laakiin ma ay ahayn.
There is nothing that can be done about it.	Ma jiraan wax laga qaban karo arrintan.
We are ready now	Hadda diyaar ayaan nahay
I can't stay here anymore.	Ma sii joogi karo halkan mar dambe.
Aren't they interesting.	Miyaanay xiiso lahayn.
I could not believe that someone else had come into me.	Ma rumaysan karin in qof kale ii soo galay.
No one did that.	Qofna taas ma samayn.
And very popular.	Oo aad loo jecel yahay.
You no longer want to lie.	Mar dambe ma rabto inaad been sheegto.
I think she is with me	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay aniga ila tahay
He did something wrong.	Wax xun buu ku sameeyay .
That's what she did.	Waa waxa ay samaysay.
I have no problem going back together	Wax dhib ah kama qabo inaan dib u wada baxo
Not sure how to do that.	Ma hubo sida aad taas u samayn karto.
I do not have.	Ma haysto.
I think.	waxaan filayaa .
Surprisingly, he didn’t get it.	Si la yaab leh, ma uusan helin.
I need to go and get it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago oo aan helo
It doesn't look like that now.	Hadda uma eka sidaas.
He said nothing to me.	Waxba ima uu odhan.
I need to find and tell	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo oo aan u sheego
This is a real surprise.	Tani waa yaab dhab ah.
I knew he said that to me	Waan ogaa inuu sidaas igu yidhi
Nothing too surprising.	Wax aad u yaab badan ma jiraan.
It was hard, it still is.	Waxay ahayd mid adag, wali waa runtii.
I really have no idea	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto
I have never seen anything like it here	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah halkan
He said he would not have enough time	Waxa uu sheegay in uusan waqti ku filan heli doonin
I told her it was very good.	Waxaan u sheegay inay aad u fiican tahay.
There was very little time.	Waqti aad u yar baa jiray.
It was a great time.	Wuxuu ahaa waqti weyn.
I think that will be another surprise.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi noqon doonto yaab kale.
Not only do I want to, I need to.	Ma doonayo oo kaliya, loo baahan yahay.
I have never been one like that	Weligay wax sidaas oo kale ah kama mid ahayn
I should have known this would happen	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado in tani dhici doonto
I was really surprised.	Runtii waan la yaabay.
I want you there, but it may happen too late	Waan ku rabaa halkaas, laakiin way dhici kartaa goor dambe
Just give me time.	Kaliya i sii waqti.
To do this, you need a job.	Si taas loo sameeyo, waxaad u baahan tahay shaqo.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma uu odhan.
I told you	Adiga ayaan u sheegay
I have no idea why he thinks so	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sababta uu sidaas ugu maleynayo
It was not the same as today.	Ma ahayn wax la mid ah maanta oo kale.
He said nothing to me.	Waxba ima uu odhan.
Not one person was spoken to	Hal qof lama hadlin
He did not come.	Uma uu iman.
Please do not do this.	Fadlan ha samayn tan.
I will not do it now.	Hadda ma yeeli doono.
I really did not like it	Runtii maan jeclayn
I can't leave anything out	Waxba kama tagi karo
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
Maybe he is right.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu sax yahay.
I think it's right.	Waxaan filayaa inay sax tahay.
I can't believe she will do that to me	Ma rumaysan karo inay sidaas igu samayn doonto
I felt I had to do the same.	Waxaan dareemay inaan sameeyo wax la mid ah.
There isn’t much, really.	Wax badan ma jiraan, runtii.
I wondered why.	Waxaan la yaabay sababta.
I am very happy to have another opportunity	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan fursad kale ka helo
Three and three.	Saddex iyo saddex.
He saw something.	Wax buu arkay.
I never got it	Weligay maan helin
Very well done.	Si aad u wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
Now you have friends.	Hadda waxaad leedahay saaxiibo.
I asked him what he was doing.	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu samaynayo.
I tried to tell him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u sheego.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
He did what he had to do.	Wuu sameeyay wixii uu samayn lahaa.
I can't afford to leave the house.	Kuma dhici karo in aan guriga ka baxo.
I really did not know why	Runtii maan garanayn sababta
He looked good, he thought.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan, wuxuu u maleeyay.
I was ready to do anything	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan sameeyo wax kasta
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo.
It cannot be so.	Ma noqon karto sidaas.
he was not ready.	diyaar uma ahayn .
But I must not.	Laakiin waa in aan.
I thought he was happy	Waxaan mooday inuu faraxsan yahay
Not done.	Lama samayn.
It is not difficult.	Adag maaha.
I need to talk to someone	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof la hadlo
There was not much to be seen.	Ma jirin wax badan oo lagu arkay.
I have no idea if it was or not.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay ahayd iyo in kale.
I knew it was better than that	Waan ogaa in ay taas ka wanaagsan tahay
It may help.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay ku caawiso.
I did not want to get a chance	Maan rabin inaan fursad u helo
So it is always.	Sidaas waa had iyo jeer.
Just an idea.	Kaliya fikrad.
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
I just can't leave here	Kaliya halkan kama tagi karo
I know her well	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa
I wanted to know where she was	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado halka ay joogto
I really don’t feel like I’m one.	Dhab ahaantii ma dareemayo inaan mid ahay.
As long as he wants, he can't stay.	Inta uu rabo, ma sii joogi karo.
No one found it.	Cidna ma ay helin.
I thought you would like it	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeclaan lahayd
I like	waan jeclahay
Have a great day.	Maalin aad u wanaagsan.
One white,.	Mid cad,.
I have to talk.	Waa inaan hadlo.
Everything she told me I did	Wax kasta oo ay igu tidhi waan sameeyay
And good thing, too.	Iyo wax wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
I didn't give a damn.	waxba ma siin.
I need to go to him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan u tago isaga
As it was.	Sidii ay ahayd.
I do it for you	aniga waan u sameeyaa
But she had a man.	Laakiin waxay lahayd nin.
But he will.	Laakiin wuu yeeli doonaa.
I would like him to leave	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu baxo
I can't do better than that	Ma samayn karo wax ka fiican taas
I could not say what it was like in the beginning	Ma sheegi karin waxay ahayd markii hore
I went somewhere	Meel baan aaday
I just started	Hadda waan bilaabay
All good stuff.	Waxyaabo fiican oo dhan.
Surprisingly, you know.	Waa yaab, waad ogtahay.
I wanted to know what happened to her	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa ku dhacay
You can do whatever you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I'm sorry, too.	Waan ka xumahay, sidoo kale.
I wish you were here	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan joogto
I should know this better now	Waa inaan tan si ka fiican u garanayaa hadda
I'm very sorry, but that's what is being done now.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay, laakiin taasi waa waxa hadda la sameeyo.
I tried to come back.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ku soo noqdo.
I did not speak	Anigu ma hadlin
They will always be there.	Had iyo jeer way joogi doonaan.
I will never tell anyone.	Weligay cidna uma sheegi doono.
That's more than we can say.	Taas oo ka badan inta aan odhan karno.
Now it really is.	Hadda waa runtii.
I don't know if he knew this or not.	Ma garanayo inuu tan ogaa iyo in kale.
But that doesn't matter.	Laakiin taasi dhib ma leh.
Maybe I should go home	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan guriga aado
I was not	Maan ahayn
Maybe another time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waqti kale.
Now he is a man.	Hadda waa nin.
I told him everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegay.
It would be nice	Way fiicnaan lahayd
It would be all we needed.	Waxa uu noqon lahaa waxa aan u baahanahay oo dhan.
He is a strong friend.	Waa saaxiib adag.
I can't do the latter.	Tan dambe ma samayn karo.
As you were, too.	Sida aad ahayd, sidoo kale.
I could not even see anything	Xitaa waxba maan arki karin
I am very happy here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay halkan
That will not hurt you	Taas waxba kugu yeeli maayo
That's what she said.	Waa sidii ay u tidhi.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
He looked back at the front door.	Albaabka hore ayuu dib u eegay.
I did not come here	Halkan kama iman
I had a great time here.	Waxaan halkan ku qaatay wakhti aad u fiican.
I wanted what he wanted	Waxaan rabay wuxuu rabay
He told me so, more than once.	Wuxuu ii sheegay sidaas, in ka badan hal mar.
I had to help you.	Waxay ahayd inaan ku caawiyo.
It will not take long.	Ma qaadan doonaan waqti dheer.
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
Although he never came to see.	In kasta oo uusan waligiis u iman inuu arko.
There is no such thing now.	Wax la mid ah hadda ma jiraan.
I have never seen anyone as amazing as you	Weligay maan arag qof kula yaab leh
It is not long.	Muddo dheer ma aha.
I think they are tough.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay adag yihiin.
I did not believe him	Maan rumaysan isaga
I want to talk to you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kaa hadlo.
I recently went out with a friend	Waxaan dhawaan u soo baxay saaxiib
I never thought I would see you again	Uma malaynayn inaan mar dambe ku arko
I had to stay	Waxay ahayd inaan joogo
I have no one to love me	Ma hayo qof i jecel
Not so bad.	Ma aha sidaas u xun.
I want to eat you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku cuno
At first it was one.	Markii hore waxay ahayd mid.
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan sax ahayn.
What to do with it.	Maxaa lagu sameeyaa.
Not everyone can do that.	Qof walba ma samayn karo taas.
Take it tomorrow.	Qaado berrito.
I wanted to do something right	Waxaan rabay inaan si sax ah wax u sameeyo
I did not know it would be him	Maan ogayn inay isaga noqon doonto
I can't believe it's you	Ma rumaysan karo inay adiga tahay
I thought you would leave	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ka bixi doonto
Back and forth.	Hor iyo dib u soo dhacay.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
I did not say what.	Ma sheegin waxa.
No one knew where to go.	Qofna ma garanayn meel loo tago.
It must be kept in place.	Waa in meel lagu hayaa.
That is not the case here and now.	Taasi maaha halkan iyo hadda.
That will not help.	Taasi ma caawin doonto.
He could not allow it to do so	Uma ogolaan karin inuu sidaas sameeyo
I broke up several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan kala tagay
I may not get a chance to see it again	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan fursad u helin inaan mar kale arko
I have never done this.	Weligay tan ma samayn.
I heard now that everyone knew by now	Waxaan maqlay hadda in qof kastaa uu ogaa ilaa hadda
Very, very bad.	Aad iyo aad u xun.
His current position is very good.	Meesha uu hadda joogo waa mid aad u wanaagsan.
I got out and looked back	Waan ka soo baxay oo dib u eegay
I can't believe you did this	Ma rumaysan karo inaad tan samaysay
But they will not.	Laakiin ma yeeli doonaan.
I felt bad afterwards	Waxaan dareemay wax xun ka dib
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax yar kula hadlo.
I can't tell anyone but you	Qof aan adiga ahayn uma sheegi karo
I can't take this now	Hadda maan qaadan karin tan hadda
I know it's not true.	Waxa aan ogahay in aanay run ahayn.
I would tell you that	sidaas ayaan kuu sheegi lahaa
I knew what was coming	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda
I did not know what tomorrow will be like	Maan garanayn sida ay berri noqon doonto
You will have a good time.	Waxaad qaadan doontaa wakhti fiican.
He has been doing this for a long time.	Muddo dheer ayuu sidaas sameeyay.
A little too long	Wax yar ayaa aad u dheer
Hard, he said.	Adag, ayuu yidhi.
That would take time.	Taasi waxay qaadan lahayd waqti.
I need to talk to you a little bit.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo wax yar.
It is very small.	Aad buu u yar yahay.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
A lot like you, really	Wax badan adiga oo kale, dhab ahaantii
I decided to go there first	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan marka hore aado halkaas
I can't go	Ma tagi karin
But he still knows who he is.	Laakiin weli wuu garanayaa cidda uu yahay.
I like it	Waan ka helay
I tried to tell you that	Waxaan isku dayay inaan taas kuu sheego
You know that's not true.	Waad ogtahay taasi run maaha.
In fact, you probably don't need this.	Run ahaantii, malaha uma baahnid tan.
I think nothing more needs to be said	Waxaan filayaa in aan wax kale loo baahnayn in la sheego
I did not like it	Maan jeclayn
I can't believe he is such a loving man	Ma rumaysan karo inuu yahay nin sidaas oo kale u jecel
This, they did not.	Tani, ma ay samayn.
He will do it.	Wuu samayn doonaa.
But the same is expected.	Laakiin sidaas oo kale ayaa la filayaa.
I can't come today	Ma iman karo maanta adiga
Older than me.	Aniga iga weyn.
We really weren’t.	Waxaan runtii ahayn.
You can't be.	Ma noqon kartid.
I want to see what he can do	Waxaan rabaa in aan arko waxa uu samayn karo
He had a problem.	Dhib ayuu lahaa.
He took it.	Wuu ka qaaday.
I didn’t think so long ago.	Wax yar ka hor uma malaynayn.
Maybe he is fine.	Malaha wuu fiican yahay.
A new era is coming	Waa cusub ayaa soo socda
I know this is hard for you	Waan ogahay in tani kugu adag tahay
I can clearly see that now	Taas si cad ayaan hadda u arki karaa
I'll see you later.	Waan ku arki doonaa dambe.
Better yet, too.	Si ka sii fiican, sidoo kale.
We will do whatever you want.	Waxaan samayn doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I just can't believe this	Kaliya tan ma rumaysan karo
That’s what I do.	Taasi waa waxa aan sameeyo.
I will take it today	maanta ayaan qaadan doonaa
you have nothing.	waxba ma aadan haysan.
You can't leave.	Ma ka bixi kartid.
But he never came home.	Laakiin waligiis guriga ma iman.
I liked what she was doing here	Waan ka helay waxa ay halkan ka samaynayso
He certainly doesn't want me.	Waa hubaal inuusan iga rabin.
I bought it a while ago	In yar ka hor ayaan iibsaday
But this may not be right.	Laakiin tani sax ma noqon karto.
I am still the same	Weli isku mid ayaan ahay
Beautiful and amazing.	Qurux iyo yaab leh.
He was a very good person.	Wuxuu ahaa qof aad u fiican.
It will not help if that is what you want	Kuma caawin doono haddii taasi ay tahay waxa aad rabto
I can't be	Ma noqon karo
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Si sax ah ayuu u ogaa waxa uu sameeyay.
I love you for who you are	Waxaan ku jeclahay wax kasta oo aad tahay
I want more than that	Waxaan rabaa wax ka badan kan
I do not know what they are	Ma garanayo waxay yihiin
This is something that surprised me.	Tani waa wax aan la yaabay aniga.
I want to do it again.	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale sameeyo.
I know she loves me, too	Waan ogahay inay i jeceshahay, sidoo kale
He wanted nothing.	Waxba wuu rabay.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
I will be leaving soon	Dhawaan ayaan halkan ka bixi doonaa
That could be the best way.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sida ugu wanaagsan.
She did not want him to leave.	Ma ay rabin inuu tago.
I want to be wherever you are	Waxaan rabaa inaan joogo meel kasta oo aad joogto
Maybe it's you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay adiga.
I felt everything	Wax walba waan dareemay
Everyone would tell you that.	Qof kasta ayaa kuu sheegi lahaa taas.
That is a good thing to do.	Taasi waa ku fiican tahay inaad sameyso.
If you want a friend, go somewhere else.	Haddii aad rabto saaxiib, aad meel kale.
I really have nothing	Runtii waxba ma hayo
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma helin.
They’re more likely to do it, too.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sameeyaan, sidoo kale.
It is not very difficult.	Ma aha mid aad u adag.
I set you up	Waa ku dhigay
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
Not so, today.	Sidaas maaha, maanta.
It was me and not me.	Aniga ayaa ahaa aniga oo aniga ma ahayn.
Not that there is much to see.	Ma aha in ay jiraan wax badan oo la arki karo.
I know you would like it	Waan ogahay inaad jeclaan lahayd
As everyone does the same thing	Sida qof walba u sameeyo wax la mid ah
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
I knew she would pay me back	Waan ogaa inay dib ii bixin doonto
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
Let it work for you.	Ha kuu shaqeeyo.
No one likes him.	Qofna ma jecla isaga.
I have nothing to say to you	Anigu waxba baan ku leeyahay
Otherwise, it is 'false'.	Haddii kale, waa 'been'.
I really have no idea why she does this	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto sababta ay tan u samayso
I never liked it.	Weligay ma jecli.
It could definitely be better.	Hubaal wuu ka fiicnaan karaa.
I really hope you enjoy it	Runtii waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto
To this day, no one knows exactly why.	Ilaa maanta, qofna si sax ah uma garanayo sababta.
I will never see him again	Mar dambe ma arki doono isaga oo nool
Which really isn't.	Taas oo run ahaantii aan ahayn.
I have never seen it.	Weligay ma arag.
He never did that quickly.	Waligiis ma uusan samayn in si degdeg ah.
I can do anything, go anywhere	Wax kasta waan samayn karaa, meel kasta aado
I don't think there is anything you can do.	Uma maleynayo inay jiraan wax aad sameyn karto.
I saw it another day.	Waxaan arkay maalin kale.
He knows what He has given us.	Wuu garanayaa waxa uu na siiyay.
Maybe, one day.	Laga yaabaa, hal maalin.
But this is a real opportunity for you.	Laakiin tani waa fursad dhab ah adiga.
I say no.	Waxaan leeyahay maaha.
This was a good idea.	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
She is very busy.	Aad bay mashquul ugu tahay.
I think.	waxaan filayaa.
I really got that	Runtii taas waan helay
He is very close.	Aad ayuu u dhow yahay.
I really wish I hadn’t left tomorrow.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaanan ka bixin berrito.
I think he can do it	Waxaan filayaa inuu samayn karo
I will never say that	Weligay taas ma odhan doono
I'm happy.	waan ku faraxsanahay.
I can't see it now	Ma arki karo hadda
It’s like he said, too.	Waa sida uu yiri, sidoo kale.
Not everyone will like it.	Qof kastaa kuma jeclaan doono.
That’s it, but it’s also more so.	Waa taas, laakiin sidoo kale waa ka sii badan tahay.
Just to help someone else.	Kaliya si aad u caawiso qof kale.
I did nothing.	waxba maan qaban.
They are alive.	Way nool yihiin.
I would do so	sidaas ayaan yeeli lahaa
I will not be able to leave work	Ma awoodi doono inaan shaqada ka tago
I took that	Taas ayaan ka qaaday
Not everyone is like you.	Qof walba adiga oo kale maaha.
Great place indeed	Meel aad u fiican runtii
I want to know why	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta
She would still be with him if.	Weli way la joogi lahayd isaga haddii.
I need to talk to him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo
I took a few.	Waxaan qaatay dhowr.
I have no time for anything else	Wax kale waqti uma hayo
I wanted to learn from you	Waxaan rabay inaan wax kaa barto
I did not tell him why.	Uma sheegin sababta.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
And not much else.	Oo aan wax badan oo kale.
I hope you will help us with this	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad nagu caawin doonto arrintan
Just stop.	Kaliya jooji.
I may not have told you everything, yet	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan wax walba kuu sheegin, weli
But it was not surprising.	Laakiin ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
That's the same.	Taasi mid la mid ah.
This is not right, that is not right.	Tani sax maaha, taasi sax maaha.
I was not him	Maan ahayn isaga
you did well	si fiican ayaad samaysay
Not just here.	Kaliya halkan maaha.
I want to do this for him	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan ku sameeyo isaga
This was a few years later.	Tani waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka dib.
I hope you are ready	Waxaan filayaa inaad diyaar u tahay
I bought it for a long time	Waxaan iibsaday muddo dheer
I am very happy to be at home	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan guriga joogo
I know what to do	Waan ogahay waxa la sameeyo
Too much time.	Waqti aad u badan.
I would make money	lacag baan samayn lahaa
I got that.	Waan helay taas.
A real person.	Qof dhab ah.
I think this and more	Waxaan qabaa taas iyo in ka badan
Not good.	Wax wanaagsan maaha.
I think it is.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay.
I just love it so much	Kaliya aad ayaan u jeclahay
I just did not know what to do	Kaliya ma garanayn waxaan sameeyo
How to speak.	Sida loo hadlo.
I hope he can be there	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu halkaas joogi karo
I decided not to do it	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan ku qaban
I know something is wrong with him	Waan ogahay in wax isaga ku xun yihiin
I really like this one.	Runtii kan aad ayaan u jeclahay.
I want to say what happened.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sheego waxa dhacay.
I have been saying this for a very long time	Waxaan rabay in aan sidaas sheego muddo aad u dheer
I do what you would do	Waxaan sameeyaa wixii aad samayn lahayd
Let me do this.	Aan sameeyo tan.
Now I can see this.	Hadda waan arki karaa tan.
I can see you, too	Waxaan ku arki karaa adiga oo kale, sidoo kale
I do not know exactly.	Si sax ah uma garanayo.
I was really in a good mood	Runtii niyad fiican ayaan ku jiray
He often had.	Inta badan wuu lahaa.
I'm happy to be here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
I know now what.	Waan ogahay hadda waxa.
I hope we can do everything real again soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale sameyn karno wax walba oo dhab ah dhawaan
In fact, they are all in the same place.	Dhab ahaantii, dhammaan waa isku meel.
Now he had no one, nothing.	Hadda cidna ma uu haysan, waxba.
But it is a lot of work.	Laakiin waa shaqo badan.
I hope you will not agree	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaadan ogolaan doonin
This is a good thing	Tani waa wax wanaagsan
Not like me.	Aniga oo kale maaha.
I think you can say a lot about that.	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas wax badan ka sheegi karto.
It will be the same.	Waxay ahaan doontaa isku mid.
I need to make a commitment	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ballan qaado
But nothing like what happened today.	Laakiin mid la mid ah ma jiro waxa dhacay maanta.
I could no longer see him	Mar dambe ma aan arki karin isaga
Something else might go there.	Wax kale ayaa laga yaabaa inuu halkaas tago.
I think that's right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay
It was obvious why.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad sababta.
Maybe you wish you didn't know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad jeclaan lahayd inaadan ogeyn.
You can do it	Waad samayn kartaa
And three.	Iyo saddex.
I heard it was really good but it was hard.	Waxaan maqlay inay runtii wanaagsan tahay laakiin ay adag tahay.
For the most part, it is true.	Inta badan, waa run.
But he lost.	Laakiin wuu waayay.
I think there is a lot to come	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jiraan wax badan oo soo socda
Not really.	Ma runtii.
I hope to see him soon!	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan arko isaga!
There is no way to find out.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado.
You are really beautiful.	Runtii waad qurux badan tahay.
Are you one of them?	Ma ka mid tahay?.
I know you can do anything	Waan ogahay inaad wax walba samayn karto
And here's another one.	Oo halkan waa mid kale.
Wherever that may be.	Meel kasta oo ay taasi noqon karto.
He knows what he wants and how to get it.	Wuu garanayaa waxa uu rabo iyo sida uu ku heli karo.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
That was very close.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
I saw it somewhere else.	Meel kale ayaan ku arkay.
I can't stop him.	Ma joojin karo isaga.
He tried that.	Wuu isku dayay taas.
And so it was.	Oo sidaas ayuu ahaa.
I'm sure it will be	Waan hubaa inay ahaan doonto
She didn't have much time.	Ma aysan haysan waqti badan.
She would believe what she would believe, do what she had.	Waxay rumaysan lahayd waxay rumaysan lahayd, samayn lahayd waxay lahayd.
I knew they didn't like it	Waan ogaa inaysan jeclayn
A lot is going on for me, you know	Wax badan ayaa ii socda, waad ogtahay
Not now.	Ma jiro hadda.
He wanted one.	Mid buu rabay.
Money.	Lacag.
Tell me now.	Hadda ii sheeg.
I just want to know where it came from	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado meesha uu ka yimid
I do not do that.	Taas ma sameeyo.
After a while, she was there.	Wax yar ka dib, waxay ahayd halkaas.
I just want to say how it is	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sheego sida ay tahay
Don't let them do it.	Ha u ogolaan inay sameeyaan.
I am very happy to help	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan caawiyo
He knows us very well.	Aad buu noo yaqaan.
I used to be, he said.	Waxaan ahaan jiray ayuu is yidhi.
No one can really help.	Qofna runtii ma caawin karo.
Everyone has time.	Qof walba waqti ayuu u helay.
This does not help anyone.	Tani cidna ma caawiso.
He is a close friend.	Waa saaxiib dhow.
Everyone was still busy.	Qof walba weli mashquul buu ahaa.
You did not leave.	Ma aadan ka tagin.
He has.	Wuu hayaa.
I can do that	Taas waan samayn karaa
I didn't know she was here.	Maan garanayn inay halkan joogto.
I wanted to know more about him	Waxa aan rabay in aan wax badan ka ogaado isaga
Really, think of it as being held.	Runtii, u malayn in la hayo.
It has a problem.	Dhib buu leeyahay.
It would take him.	Way qaadan lahayd isaga.
Maybe I have something for you	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax kuu hayo
Don't get what you don't want.	Ha helin wax aadan rabin.
I never thought they would happen.	Weligay uma malaynayn inay dhici doonaan.
I tried it everywhere	Waxaan isku dayay meel kasta
I have to make some money.	Waa inaan sameeyaa xoogaa lacag ah.
I began to see things.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan wax arko.
I just want to know what’s going on	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa socda
Something else.	Wax iyo wax kale.
But what he wanted was someone who didn't want him.	Laakiin waxa uu rabay ayaa ahaa qof aan isaga rabin.
.	.
I was very upset.	Aad baan uga baxay.
Too much food.	Cunto aad u badan.
I am ready for anything	Wax walba diyaar ayaan u ahay
I doubt you even exist	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inaad xitaa jirto
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax weyn.
I would definitely stay	Hubaal waan sii joogi lahaa
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
Do not say anything else.	Wax kale ha odhan.
I never did that.	Weligay taas ma samayn.
They are very small.	Aad bay u yar yihiin.
I really didn’t want to know.	Runtii ma rabin in aan ogaado.
Maybe they are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay yihiin.
I really didn't see it	Runtii ma arki jirin
I can give it to you now	hadda waan ku siin karaa
I need to talk to him.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo.
But it has been with me for a long time.	Laakiin waxa ay ila ahayd wakhti dheer.
I love you more than ever today	Maanta si ka badan sidii hore ayaan kuu jeclahay
But that is to be expected.	Laakiin taasi waa la filayaa.
Not who we are.	Ma aha cidda aan nahay.
I have been with you for a long time	Muddo dheer ayaan kula joogay
As big as he is, he can never afford it.	Sida uu u weyn yahay, waligiis ma awoodo.
I don't want to do it again.	Ma doonayo inaan mar kale sameeyo.
I have never been there.	Weligay halkaas ma tagin.
He was there every day.	Maalin walba wuu joogay.
To know that he can do anything.	Si aad u ogaato in uu wax walba samayn karo.
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
I can't see this	Ma arki karo arrintan
He probably thinks he knows.	Waxaa loo malaynayaa inuu garanayo.
I wish you the same.	Waxaan kuu rajeynayaa sidaas oo kale.
I did that yesterday and the day before	Shalay iyo maalin ka hor ayaan sidaas sameeyay
I got into a lot of trouble	Dhib badan ayaan galay
I have things to do here	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan ku sameeyo halkan
It would happen everywhere.	Meel walba way ka dhici lahayd.
I can see it is hard work	Waxaan arki karaa inay tahay shaqo adag
I will not go home.	Guriga ma aadi doono.
I want something similar	Waxaan rabaa wax la mid ah
I didn't think it was enough.	Uma malaynayn inuu ku filan yahay.
He was everything to me.	Wax walba ayuu ii ahaa.
I'm really happy	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
No one was.	Qofna ma ahayn.
Is that correct?	Ma sax baa?.
I know this is not everything	Waan ogahay in tani aysan ahayn wax walba
It was early but definitely.	Waxay ahayd goor hore laakiin hubaal.
I hope you would do well.	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax fiican samayn lahayd.
Maybe that will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ku caawin doonto.
I just have to get it	Kaliya waa inaan helo
I always felt a little invisible	Waxaan had iyo jeer dareemay wax yar oo aan la arki karin
No one can stay here for too long.	Qofna halkan ma joogi karo muddo aad u dheer.
I heard it clearly	Waxaan ku maqlay si cad
I rejected it all	Waan diiday dhammaan
This is not correct.	Tani sax uma eka.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo.
I'll talk to you later	dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa
Stop.	Jooji.
I know that is bad for you	Waan ogahay in taasi ay kuu xun tahay
I'm glad he's here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu halkan joogo.
I want to know if this has been done	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado in tan la sameeyay
It won't be long	Waqti dheer ma tagi doono
We can't do this.	Tani ma samayn karno.
Don't want that.	Ha rabin taas.
Maybe that's why.	Malaha taasi waa sababta.
I have another one to go to	Waxaan hayaa mid kale oo aan aado
I do not want to be here	Ma rabo inaan halkaan joogo
There is not much to work on.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo lagu shaqeeyo.
That's what they do.	Taasi waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
I have seen and heard enough	Waxaan arkay oo maqlay in ku filan
I got some work.	Waxaan helay xoogaa shaqo ah.
He got in trouble.	Dhib buu helay.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
I would go with you everywhere	Meel kasta waan kula tagi lahaa
and.	iyo.
I know you will do well	Waan ogahay inaad si fiican wax u qaban doonto
I wanted to stay here	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaan sii joogo
I wanted to talk to you first.	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo marka hore.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
That is how it feels.	Taasi waa sida laga dareemay.
I never really stopped working	Weligay runtii shaqada ma joojin
But it was fun.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
He really didn’t do the same thing.	Dhab ahaantii ma uusan samayn wax la mid ah.
This is new to me.	Tani waa igu cusub tahay.
He really was.	Runtii wuu ahaa.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan.
Good day before.	Maalin wanaagsan ka hor.
I wonder what it was	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ay ahayd
I have never liked it so much	Weligay wax badan maan jeclayn
Very beautiful this.	Aad u qurux badan tan.
This is the most common reason.	Tani waa sababta ugu badan.
I do not think so	Uma maleynayo
Will stay again.	Mar kale sii joogi doona.
I think it will get better over time	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu fiicnaan doono muddo ka dib
He started coming out late and doing whatever he felt.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu goor dambe soo baxo oo uu sameeyo wax kasta oo uu dareemayo.
He said he hopes to come.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu rajaynayo inuu yimaado.
I would give you one	Mid baan ku siin lahaa
I didn’t really take it.	Si dhab ah uma qaadan.
I knew what it could be	Waan ogaa waxa ay noqon karto
I should not have said that	Ma ahayn inaan anigu taas u sheego
I will do everything right.	Wax walba si sax ah ayaan u samayn doonaa.
I wanted to know what was going on there	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa halkaas ka socda
The bigger it is the better.	Ka weyn ayaa ka fiican.
I will talk to him.	Waan la hadli doonaa.
This is no small feat.	Tani maaha wax yar.
This was nothing new to me.	Tani wax igu cusub ma ahayn.
He must have left.	Waa in uu ka baxay.
Probably not even good.	Waxay u badan tahay xitaa ma fiicnaan lahayd.
Every idea is a good idea.	Fikrad kasta waa fikrad wanaagsan.
It looks bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun.
They did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
It doesn't look like anything.	Waxba uma eka.
But why would this be.	Laakiin waa maxay sababta tani ay noqon doonto.
I just say that is not a good thing.	Kaliya waxaan leeyahay taasi maaha wax fiican.
I knew I wouldn’t be here for long.	Waan ogaa inaanan halkan joogi doonin wax aad u dheer.
There is nothing to do here.	Ma jiraan wax halkan lagu sameeyo.
I can't believe he did this to me	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan ii sameeyay
I am very happy for him.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga.
In fact, it may be the best.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon kartaa tan ugu fiican.
It's really amazing	Runtii waa yaab
I have to say it.	Waa inaan ila leeyahay.
I did not go	Ma aadi jirin
But that won’t do, either.	Laakiin taasi ma yeeli doonto, sidoo kale.
And very big.	Oo aad u weyn.
This is enough.	Tani waa ku filan tahay.
I did not want to be seen	Ma rabin in la i arko
I think he is happy to come home.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu guriga yimaado.
I just happened to be right	Kaliya waxaan ku dhacay inaan sax ahay
I can't tell.	Uma sheegi karo.
I will not do that again	Mar dambe taas ku samayn maayo
I wanted everything else.	Wax walba oo kale ayaan rabay.
ima ay arag.	ima ay arag.
You think you are.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad tahay.
It won't be long.	Ma noqon doonto waqti dheer.
I didn't think so.	Ma malaynayn.
I found something to eat	waxaan ku helay wax aad cunto
It is a great opportunity.	Waa fursad weyn.
I know you can't see	Waan ogahay inaadan arki karin
I was so bad people	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u xun dadka
Nothing can be done.	Waxba lama qaban karo.
I am not a big problem	Ma ihi dhibaato weyn
I'm still sure of that.	Weli waan hubaa taas.
I love being there.	Jeclahay inaan halkaas joogo.
But you may not.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan samayn.
They are great.	Way weyn yihiin.
He is a tough guy.	Waa nin adag.
You just love it.	Kaliya waad jeceshahay.
Several others as well.	Dhowr kale sidoo kale.
I refused to return.	Waan diiday inaan noqdo.
This was a new idea.	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad cusub.
Being with you was great.	In aan kula joogo waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan.
Who was that.	Yaa sidaas ahaa.
It is like him doing this.	Waxay la mid tahay isaga inuu tan sameeyo.
In fact, this is not true.	Run ahaantii, tani run maaha.
I did not know he would go until now	Maan ogayn inuu aadi doono ilaa hadda
Nothing.	Wax aan jirin.
I picked it up and looked at it	Waan soo qaaday oo eegay
Not like you.	Adiga oo kale maaha.
I got into trouble.	Waxaan galay dhibaato.
I know everyone.	Waan ogahay qof walba.
I felt she did not understand	Waxaan dareemay in aysan fahmin
But I did not understand.	Laakiin ma fahmin.
But him.	Laakiin isaga.
There is nothing you can do to me.	Wax aad igu samayn karto ma jirto.
Still, it was amazing.	Weli, waxay ahayd yaab.
I knew it could not be done	Waxaan ogaa inaan la samayn karin
Nothing good will come of it.	Wax wanaagsan ka soo bixi maayo.
He would stay.	Wuu joogi lahaa.
I need to tell someone, once.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof u sheego, hal mar.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
I think everyone came beautifully.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba si qurux badan u yimid.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Waqti aan wax ku sameeyo ma helin.
I could not.	Waan awoodi waayay.
I left	waan ka baxay
But he did not have to be him.	Laakiin ma ahayn inuu isaga noqdo.
I did what was required	Waxaan sameeyay wixii la rabay
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.	Ha u ogolaan qofna inuu si kale kuu sheego.
I will think that when I go.	Waxaan u malayn doonaa in marka aan tago.
I can talk about that now.	Taas hadda waan ka hadli karaa.
I will not talk about it again	Mar dambe ka hadli maayo
Everyone else was at work.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa ku jiray shaqada.
But they could not help it.	Laakiin waa la caawin waayay.
I have always been	Waxaan noqday mid had iyo jeer ahaa
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
Just do it is something.	Kaliya ha sameeyo waa wax.
They will not allow it.	Ma ogolaan doonaan.
A man alone cannot help	Nin kaliya ma caawin karo
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
It was not.	Ma ay ahayn.
I can take time	Waqti ayaan la qaadan karaa
Of them.	Oo ka mid ah.
But that is not the reason.	Laakiin taasi maaha sababta.
To do.	In la sameeyo.
You too.	Adiga sidoo kale.
It was a very exciting day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u xiiso badan.
I can't believe you're here.	Ma rumaysan karo inaad halkan joogto.
She made a long day.	Waxay samaysay maalin dheer.
I am the people.	Waxaan ahay dadka.
That is exactly a problem.	Taasi waa sax dhibaato.
I wanted to be with him forever	Waxaan rabay inaan la joogo weligay
If you know more about it, please let me know.	Haddii aad wax badan ka ogtahay, fadlan ii sheeg.
I can't take it that way.	Anigu sidaas uma qaadan karo.
I know what that is now	Waan ogahay waxa taasi hadda tahay
I love everything you do	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo aad sameyso
I knew you would be fine	Waan ogaa inaad fiicnaan doonto
He did that well.	Taas si fiican ayuu u sameeyay.
I would like to know	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado
I could not say anything	Waxba waan ka hadli waayay
I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not.	Ma hubo in taasi tahay wax wanaagsan iyo in kale.
This is difficult for me.	Tani way igu adag tahay.
I will not lie.	Been sheegi maayo.
I think they can do no harm	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaysan waxba yeeli karin
I am still happy	Wali waan ku faraxsanahay
I was really impressed	Runtii aad baan ula dhacay
It is yours and mine alone.	Adiga ayaa iska leh oo aniga kaliya ayaa leh.
That it was real.	In ay dhab ahayd.
He can still do something.	Weli wax wuu samayn karaa.
I will not do this again.	Mar dambe tan ma samaynayo.
I think they need time	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay u baahan yihiin waqti
Don't stop anything.	Waxba ha u joojin.
I am, as it were, here	Waxaan ahay, sida ay ahayd, halkan
I felt it was good	Waxa aan dareemay in ay u wanaagsan tahay
He said it was not correct.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay sax ahayn.
I really didn't do any work	Runtii wax shaqo ah maan qaban
I did not know you were there	Maan ogayn inaad meesha joogto
I don't like that.	Ma jecli taas.
And other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale.
I did not succeed in that.	Kuma aan guulaysan taas.
That was a very good thing.	Taas oo ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan.
There are many of us	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaa jira
I will be with you from now on	hadda ka dib waan kula joogi doonaa
I will not stay here much longer	In badan ma sii joogi doono halkan
I will not find a place to go	Meel aan aado ma heli doono
It’s not just the door.	Ma aha albaabka oo kaliya.
See and.	Arag iyo.
I am not what you say	Anigu ma ihi waxaad leedahay
I can't do that now	Taas hadda ma samayn karo
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
He said nothing	Waxba ma odhan
And you did not get it.	Oo ma aadan helin.
They really do.	Runtii way sameeyaan.
I really owe you one	Runtii mid baan kugu leeyahay
More to come	Wax badan oo soo socda
She had.	Way lahayd.
It was a little surprising.	Waxay ahayd yaab yar.
I am so glad you can do it.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad samayn karto.
I saw you.	Waan ku arkay.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
In fact, it was awful.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I love you	waan ku jeclahay
Inta.	Inta.
He knew they would see it.	Wuu ogaa inay arki doonaan.
This is the same.	Tani waa isku mid.
I slammed the door back	Albaabka ayaan dib uga noqday
He seems to be feeling it.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu dareemayo.
I can't lie.	Been uma sheegi karo.
To know but not to know.	Si aad u ogaato laakiin aadan ogeyn.
So did everyone else.	Sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale ayaa lahaa.
I just know who.	Kaliya waan garanayaa cidda.
She said that was nothing new.	Waxay sheegtay in taasi aysan ahayn wax cusub.
I saw things you could hardly imagine	Waxaan arkay waxyaabo aad si dhib leh u malayn karin
I will do it again	Mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa
After all, it is not.	Taas ka dib, ma aha.
I need to know what else he knows	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxa kale ee uu yaqaan
Beautiful things.	Waxyaabo qurux badan.
I should not have done that.	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I could not do that once	Taas hal mar ma awoodin
I knew how much you needed, too	Waan ogaa inta aad u baahan tahay, sidoo kale
I looked back at him	Waxaan dib u eegay isaga
He never did.	Waligiis ma samayn.
From the point of view.	Meesha laga eegay.
There was really no money.	Runtii lacag ma jirin.
It is likely that I will have a problem again soon	Waxa ay u badan tahay in aan dhibaato mar kale soo noqon doono muddo yar ka dib
I still do not understand.	Wali ma fahmin.
But that was very close.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid aad ugu dhow.
She could not stay at work.	Wax shaqo ah kama ay sii joogi karin.
She was one man.	Waxay ahayd hal nin.
You are just you.	Waxaad tahay kaliya adiga.
It looks like a long time ago.	Waxay u egtahay wakhti dheer ka hor hadda.
Definitely enough, he did.	Hubaal ku filan, wuu sameeyay.
She looks like him.	Waxay u egtahay isaga oo kale.
He is the most.	Isaga ayaa ugu badan.
I would see what else was available to me	Waxaan arki lahaa waxa kale oo ii diyaar ah
I want him to leave once and for all	Waxaan rabaa inuu ka baxo hal mar iyo dhammaan
I just need to talk to someone	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof la hadlo
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
I thought we were friends and acquaintances	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan nahay saaxiib iyo saaxiib
I think it may take some time	Waxaan filayaa inay qaadan karto wakhti
I just can't do anything here	Kaliya halkan waxba kuma qaban karo
I'm happy	waan ku faraxsanahay
I still wonder what happened to him	Waxaan wali la yaabanahay waxa ku dhacay
Only once.	Kaliya tan hal mar.
I refused what would have happened	Waan iska diiday waxa dhici lahaa
I really have to be in trouble	Runtii waa inaan dhibaato ku jiraa
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
Luckily, everyone has a job	Nasiib ayaan leeyahay, qof walba shaqo buu leeyahay
I decided to leave until after school	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan ka tago ilaa dugsiga ka dib
I would love to see it.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan arko.
I know you are here.	Waan ogahay inaad halkan ku jirto.
I can no longer go home	Mar dambe ma aadi karo guriga
I'm not sure you agree.	Ma hubo inaad isku maan tahay.
No one knew anything.	Qofna waxba ma ogayn.
I think that is everything, so far	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay wax walba, ilaa hadda
I really did not see that	Runtii taas maan arag
You can tell he really got into it.	Waxaad u sheegi kartaa inuu runtii galay.
At first, everyone was there.	Markii hore, qof kastaa wuu joogay.
You really shouldn’t.	Runtii waa inaadan.
I got the same money	Waxaan helay lacag la mid ah
I have never seen anything more beautiful	Weligay wax ka qurux badan ma arag
I have never seen you here before	Hadda ka hor halkan kuma aan arag adiga
I won't tell you for sure.	Dhab ahaan kuu sheegi maayo inay ahayd.
you did not go here	halkan ma aadan tagin
There was more to him than meets the eye.	Waxaa jiray wax isaga uga badan inuu qof walba arko.
I know he loves me and needs me	Waan ogahay inuu i jecel yahay oo uu ii baahan yahay
I can't do anything.	waxba ma qaban karo.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
I really like it now	Runtii waan jeclahay hadda
There is someone who is difficult for everyone.	Waxaa jira qof qof walba ku adag.
It would be him.	Waxay noqon lahayd isaga.
That was a great day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
I wanted to see everything	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba arko
I started to help him	Waxaan bilaabay inaan caawiyo isaga
I really want to help you	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
I liked him that way	Isaga sidaas ayaan uga helay
I can't believe no one wants to buy this	Ma rumaysan karo qofna ma rabo inuu tan iibsado
It is very small.	Aad ayuu u yar yahay.
No matter what happened.	Dhib malaha waxa dhacay.
Not done.	Lama samayn.
You may have to do this several times.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tan sameyso dhowr jeer.
I know that now.	Waan ogahay taas hadda.
I took time, yesterday	Waxaan qaatay waqti, shalay
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
I did nothing	waxba maan samayn
I still can't believe she is really here	Wali ma rumaysan karo inay runtii halkan joogto
I did not know who you are	Maan garanayn cidda aad tahay
I wanted to stay.	Waxaan rabay inaan joogo.
I know you want more	Waan ogahay inaad wax badan rabto
I can clearly see the day	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa maalin ahaan
I want to work on it	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka shaqeeyo
He said there was no time.	Wuxuu sheegay in aysan jirin waqti.
I no longer had the opportunity to speak to him	Mar dambe fursad uma helin inaan la hadlo
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
I hope you are like that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas tahay
I just do.	Kaliya waan sameeyaa.
I have to find him, you know.	Waa inaan helo isaga, waad ogtahay.
I desperately need him.	Aad baan ugu baahanahay isaga.
I have to work	Waa inaan shaqeeyo
I did not know that this existed	Maan ogayn in ay tani jirto
Maybe he really thought he did.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu dhab ahaantii u maleeyay inuu sameeyay.
There was still time.	Weli wakhti baa jiray.
Just stop doing that now.	Kaliya jooji taas hadda.
We go, you and I.	Waanu tagi, aniga iyo adiga.
Maybe I should do it somewhere else	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan meel kale ku sameeyo
They should.	Waa inay.
It’s like everything else.	Waa sida wax kasta oo kale.
I couldn't believe it was him.	Waan rumaysan waayay inuu isaga yahay.
I need to know what happened	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
He was given food.	Waxaa la siiyay cunto.
I have never been there.	Weligay halkaas ma joogin.
Up to three.	Ilaa saddex.
I am still.	weli waan ahay.
I did not know who you are	Maan garanayn qofka aad tahay
I do not see why this is so difficult.	Ma arko sababta ay tani u adag tahay.
Time to go.	Waqti aad tagi lahayd.
I hope he is very good	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu aad u wanaagsan yahay
I have never seen him here	Weligay halkan kuma arag
I can't think of one now	Ma malayn karo mid hadda
I wanted to be there	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas joogo
I am something other than that	Waxaan ahay wax aan taas ahayn
I wish it weren’t so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aanay noqon sidaas.
But you know that.	Laakiin taas waad ogtahay.
What does he do?	muxuu sameeyaa?.
I still will not believe it	Wali ma rumaysan doono
I knew what he wanted	Waan ogaa waxa uu rabo
I think you might go home	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo inaad guriga aado
I have been there several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan halkaas tagay
I could not imagine what he would do	Ma malayn karin waxa uu samayn doono
I know what it looks like.	Waan ogahay sida ay u egtahay.
I do not like to see that	Ma jecli inaan taas arko
It is more than one year.	Waxa ay ka badan tahay hal sano.
Others are better, but not always available.	Dadka kale ayaa ka fiican, laakiin mar walba lama heli karo.
you have.	waxaad leedahay.
It didn't take long.	Waqti kuma ay soo bixin.
Maybe he should go home.	Malaha waa inuu guriga aado.
I can not say it is true	Ma odhan karo waa run
It was a difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti adag.
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
I have tried hard, for a long time	Waxaan isku dayay si adag, waqti dheer
Someone got into a lot of trouble.	Qof baa galay dhib badan.
I was ready to see what else was there	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan arko waxa kale oo halkaas ka jira
I couldn't help that.	Taas waan ku caawin waayay.
I just need to eat	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan cuno
This is not the best.	Tani ma aha tan ugu fiican.
No one.	Qofna ma aha.
But that is.	Laakiin taasi waa.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
It's bad, bad.	Waa wax xun, wax xun.
Back a little bit.	Dib u yara yara.
It will be you and me.	Waxay noqon doontaa adiga iyo aniga.
I have not done this for a long time	Tan muddo dheer maan samayn
He left.	Wuu baxay.
Only, not me, not me	Kaliya, ma jiro aniga, aniga
I just went for it.	Kaliya waan u aaday.
A man is walking towards us	Nin baa noo socda
You would really like it.	Runtii waad jeclaan lahayd.
Everyone wanted to know who made it.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado cidda samaysay.
I am an adult.	Waxaan ahay qof weyn.
I have never seen anything so beautiful.	Weligay ma arag wax sidaas u qurux badan.
It is a beautiful opportunity.	Waxay u tahay fursad qurux badan.
I know how this is	Waan ogahay sida ay tani tahay
Now he would do it.	Hadda wuu samayn lahaa.
Do nothing.	Waxba ha samayn.
He came to me.	Wuu ii soo galay.
Well, but.	Si fiican, laakiin.
They are too long, aren't they?	Aad bay u dheer yihiin miyaanay ahayn.
Not like this.	Ma aha sida tan.
And much, much more.	Iyo wax badan, ka badan.
Interesting to see.	Xiiso leh in la arko.
I am the one you want	Waxaan ahay ka aad rabto
Something strange happened.	Wax yaab leh ayaa dhacay.
We are.	Waxaan nahay.
He was there	Wuu joogay
No one could stop me.	Qofna ima joojin karin.
I'm really happy about that.	Runtii waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
I should not have been anywhere else	Ma ahayn inaan meel kale joogo
It will be fine, he thought.	Way fiicnaan doontaa, ayuu is yidhi.
Unemployment.	Shaqo la'aan.
Not yet.	Weli sidaas maaha.
I began to wonder what had happened to you	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay maxaa kugu dhacay
We will do whatever they want	Waxaan samayn doonaa waxay doonaan
Maybe I should go now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan aado hadda.
I'm sure they will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa inay fiicnaan doonaan.
There is nothing else	Wax kale ma jiraan
But here it is.	Laakiin halkan waa.
There it is now.	Waxaa jira hadda.
I can do that a little, but not much.	Waan samayn karaa taas wax yar, laakiin ma aha wax badan.
I found someone like me.	Waxaan helay qof aniga ila mid ah.
That was tough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
There is nothing more than this.	Ma jiraan wax ka badan tan.
I did nothing	waxba maan samayn
I'm back now	hadda waan soo noqday
I think today is a good day	Waxaan filayaa inay maanta tahay maalin wanaagsan
I have been here for over a year	Waxaan halkaan joogay in ka badan hal sano
That is a problem.	Taas oo ah dhibaato.
I think this is likely.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay u badan tahay.
There is nothing else going on.	Wax kale oo socda ma jiraan.
They did not stop him.	Ma ay joojin isaga.
Right here.	Isla halkan.
I saw that he still had some money	Waxaan arkay inuu weli haysto xoogaa lacag ah
I am the one in prison, after all	Waxaan ahay kan xabsiga ku jira, ka dib oo dhan
It was the best thing we could do.	Waxa uu ahaa waxa ugu fiican ee aan samayn karno.
This is what you would do.	Tani waa waxa aad samayn lahayd.
I knew this would come one day	Waan ogaa inay tani iman doonto maalin
They should have done this a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd inay tan sameeyaan wakhti dheer ka hor.
Enough	Ku filan
I want to be found.	Waxaan rabaa in la helo.
I really didn't want anything	Runtii waxba maan rabin
It’s the only thing that really does.	Waa waxa kaliya ee la sameeyo runtii.
But if you had.	Laakiin haddii aad lahayd.
It really is how we live.	Runtii waa sida aan u nool nahay.
I have no idea why this is so difficult.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sababta ay tani u adag tahay.
He has to be good.	Waa inuu fiican yahay.
You did not have to do this.	Ma ahayn inaad tan samayso.
There was a lot he didn't understand.	Wax badan oo uusan fahmin ayaa jiray.
I didn't want to talk.	Ma rabin inaan hadlo.
I can't believe this is it	Ma rumaysan karo in tani ay tahay
I have no money	Lacag aan ku helo ma haysto
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
They are new	Way cusub yihiin
He could not say anything.	Waxba wuu ku odhan waayay.
He couldn't do it.	Waa uu ka yeeli waayay.
That is not the same.	Taasi isku mid maaha.
Someone needs to say something.	Qof baa u baahan inuu wax sheego.
I know they are not together	Waxaan ogahay in aanay isla joogin
I did not stop him	Maan joojin isaga
I still have it, too	Weli waan hayaa, sidoo kale
I wanted to tell him more.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan u sheego isaga.
I can't even find him	Xitaa ma heli karo isaga
It will catch me.	Way i qaban doontaa.
I love helping people	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo dadka
You can find it here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
He is a person you love.	Waa qof aad jeceshahay.
I should not have done that.	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I did not take any chances	Ma aanan qaadan wax fursad ah
That was a lot of work.	Taasi waxay ahayd shaqo badan.
A real man.	Nin dhab ah.
I had one more time.	Waxaan lahaa hal mar oo kale.
You can't take time.	Ma qaadan kartid wakhti.
I have no idea how good this is	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto sida tani u fiican tahay
I'll talk about it tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
That cannot be said for everyone.	Taas lama odhan karo qof walba.
I just.	Waxaan kaliya.
I have someone, too	Waxaan leeyahay qof, sidoo kale
I hope you will agree	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ogolaan doonto
I think it looks very good.	Waxaan filayaa inay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
He is still there.	Wali ma joogo.
There is something wrong there.	Waxaa jira wax aan sax ahayn halkaas.
I heard it a long time ago	Waxaan maqlay waa hore
Made a bit since.	La sameeyay xoogaa tan iyo taas.
Anyone can see it	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa
He never liked it.	Waligiis ma jeclayn.
That is unknown at this time.	Taas hadda lama garanayo.
I wish I had it in its place	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aan ku haysto meesha ay iska leedahay
I have no idea how to do it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida uu u sameeyo
I wonder if you would help me with something	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aad wax igu caawin lahayd
I also had no luck there	Sidoo kale nasiib kuma helin halkaas
You are a day older than me.	Maalin baad iga weyn tahay.
I know who you really are	Waan ogahay qofka aad tahay runtii
It can take time.	Waxay sameyn kartaa waqti.
I say, it is enough	Waxaan leeyahay, waa ku filan tahay
I love people who love me	Waxaan jeclahay dadka aad ii jecel
A good place for him	Meel wanaagsan isaga
I never want to say that.	Weligay ma doonayo inaan sidaas u hadlo.
I hope we are ready	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan diyaar u nahay
He saw that.	Wuu arkay taas.
I did not want to be with him	Maan rabin inaan la joogo
The former is missing.	Kii hore waa la waayay.
Is this enough ?.	Tani ma ku filan tahay?.
Now I can't.	Hadda ma awoodo in aan awoodo.
But you can do that there, too.	Laakiin taas waxaad ka samayn kartaa halkaas, sidoo kale.
Maybe he heard something else.	Malaha wax kale ayuu maqlay.
She told him the truth.	Run bay u sheegtay.
I didn't have much time	Waqti badan ma helin
Not yet.	Ilaa hadda ma jiro.
Something great appeared.	Wax weyn ayaa ka muuqday.
Who found a common ground.	Yaa helay meel la wada leeyahay.
I do enough for one year	Waxaan sameeyaa wax ku filan hal sano
But it was tough, tough.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid adag, adag.
Maybe that's right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax tahay.
People can't stay	Dadka ma joogi karo
A little.	In yar.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad rabto
I can't find the reason.	Sababta ma heli karo.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
A little money	In yar oo lacag ah
But that is what it was.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa uu ahaa.
I didn't need much more.	Wax badan oo kale uma baahnayn.
I hope everyone loves it	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu jecel yahay
If that is the best thing we can do, we will do it.	Haddii ay taasi tahay waxa ugu fiican ee aan sameyn karno, waan sameyn doonaa.
I didn't want him for sure.	Ma rabin isaga hubaal.
I dont understand.	Maan fahmin.
I don't know why really.	Ma garanayo sababta runtii.
Not everyone can say the same.	Qof kastaa ma odhan karo isku mid.
I have done it before	Hore ayaan u sameeyay
I can see that coming	Waxaan arki karaa in soo socda
I wish I had it now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan hadda haysto
He always knows what he is doing.	Mar walba waxa uu sameeyo wuu yaqaan.
But I don't want that.	Laakiin taas ma rabto.
I would stay with him.	waan la joogi lahaa.
I didn't have to	Ma ahayn in aan sameeyo
He left, never returned.	Wuu baxay, dib uma soo noqon.
I never thought of that	Weligay uma malaynayn taas
I wanted to be part of it	Waxaan rabay in aan ka mid noqdo
He really knew that.	Runtii taas wuu ogaa.
Really, really he had.	Runtii, runtii wuu lahaa.
It is not that he will ever do anything like that.	Ma aha in uu waligiis samayn doono wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I never got to work.	Weligay uma helin inaan shaqeeyo.
I did not want to eat	Maan rabin inaan cuno
And it was very interesting again.	Oo waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan mar kale.
Something more interesting here.	Waxyaabo halkan ka yara xiiso badan.
I have never really been to school much	Weligay runtii wax badan uma aan joogin dugsiga
Obviously he could never do that.	Sida iska cad inuu taas waligiis samayn karin.
But that may not be the case.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
I really wanted to see a real one	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan arko mid dhab ah
I really wanted to be with you	Waxaan aad u rabay inaan kula joogo
I will not lie to you again	Mar dambe been kuu sheegi maayo
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma.
I'm really sorry about that	Runtii aad ayaan uga xumahay arrintan
Three.	Saddex.
I really found the room	Runtii qolka waan helay
You can't find anything for me.	Aniga waxba ma heli kartid.
That is why it is there.	Taasi waa sababta ay halkaas u tahay.
I would let him go	Waxaan u ogolaan lahaa inuu baxo
I didn't have to do anything	Ma ahayn inaan wax sameeyo
He told her.	Sidaas ayuu u sheegay.
Enough said now.	Ku filan ayaa sheegay hadda.
There is no time.	Waqti ma jiro.
I will do more	Wax badan ayaan qaban doonaa
I could not tell him	Waan u sheegi waayay
I should have known it would happen	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inay dhici doonto
Required.	Loo baahan yahay.
But he could not do anything.	Laakiin waxba ma uu qaban karin.
Where he lives.	Meesha uu ku nool yahay.
I pretended.	Waan iska dhigay.
There is very little going on for me	Wax aad u yar ayaa ii socda
He will have a good time.	Waqti fiican ayuu heli doonaa.
It is old as well as now.	Waa hore iyo sidoo kale hadda.
Not this, he thought.	Ma aha tan, ayuu u maleeyay.
I had to get it right away	Waxay ahayd inaan si degdeg ah u helo
I have never seen another man like him	Wali maan arag nin kale oo isaga la mid ah
You can and do believe that.	Waa hubaal oo waad rumaysan kartaa taas.
I want everyone to get a job.	Waxaan rabaa in qof walba uu helo shaqo.
I want to talk to him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo
I can't help it now, but much later	Hadda kuma caawin karo, laakiin wax badan ka dib
I have done nothing here	Waxba kama aanan qaban halkan
I never thought so	Weligay ma malaynayn
Unfortunately.	Nasiib maaha.
I do not want to see	Ma rabo inaan arko
I have always been that way.	Weligay sidaas ayaan ahaan jiray.
I am now at school	Hadda waxaan joogaa dugsiga
It is a difficult place to be.	Waa meel adag in la joogo.
That is where he is.	Waa meesha uu joogo.
And much more.	Iyo wax kale oo badan.
I just could not see	Kaliya waan arki waayay
I have never been lucky	Weligay nasiib uma helin
I hope someone helps.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay qof caawiso.
I know what I do with that.	Waan ogahay waxa aan ka sameeyo taas.
Too bad, really	Mid aad u xun, dhab ahaantii
Do you know that you are like me?	Ma ogtahay inaad aniga ila mid tahay.
I will never do it for him	Weligay ma yeeli doono isaga
I would like him to leave with me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu ila baxo
I did not know she was here	Maan garanayn inay halkan joogto
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
I seem to have taken a lot	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan wax badan soo qaatay
It was not him.	Ma ahayn isaga.
See everything with me.	Wax walba ila arag.
I did not see.	Maan arag.
This is how things are done.	Tani waa sida wax loo sameeyo.
I know you do not believe me	Waan ogahay inaadan i rumaysan
Maybe someone would stay home.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof guriga joogi lahaa.
I felt everything.	Wax walba waan dareemay.
I would like to buy a car	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan iibsado baabuur
You really will.	Runtii waad yeeli doontaa.
I had to stay	Waxay ahayd inaan meesha iska joogo
I can't come now	Hadda ma iman karo
He was at work, he said.	Waxa uu ku jiray shaqada, ayuu yidhi.
It was, after all, invisible.	Waxay ahayd, ka dib oo dhan, aan la arki karin.
That is what he does.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyo.
I really did not know what to do	Runtii ma garanayn waxaan sameeyo
I can't believe anyone would do that	Ma rumaysan karo in qof sidaas samayn lahaa
Wonder what is in there.	Yaab waxa meesha ku jira.
Maybe he too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale.
I wanted it done	Waxaan rabay in la sameeyo
I did not see that.	Taas maan arag.
Something very familiar, but it is old.	Wax aad loo yaqaan, laakiin waa hore.
There must be something else you can do.	Waa inuu jiraa wax kale oo aad sameyn karto.
Let's do it.	Aan samayno.
Bad is bad.	Xun ayaa xun.
I saw things that others could not	Waxaan arkay waxyaabo aysan dadka kale awoodin
This is not really the case.	Tani dhab ahaantii sidaas maaha.
I got something	wax baan helay
Nothing better should be found to be done.	Waa in aan la helin wax ka fiican oo la sameeyo.
They do worse than nothing.	Waxay sameeyaan wax ka xun waxba.
I have never seen anything like it	Wax sidaas oo kale ah maan arag
Maybe I don't always like him	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan mar walba jeclayn isaga
Probably.	Waxay u badan tahay inay.
Very good, right.	Aad u fiican, sax.
That is what she wants.	Taasi waa waxa ay rabto.
He was very interesting.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I know where he is	Waan ogahay meesha uu joogo
I wanted to know more	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ogaado
There was no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn.
It just isn’t something that came out, really.	Kaliya maaha wax soo baxay, runtii.
Not knowing.	Aan ogayn.
I want someone to tell me what to do	Waxaan rabaa in qof ii sheego waxaan sameeyo
I liked that	Taas ayaan uga helay
I asked him to leave.	Waxaan ka codsaday inuu baxo.
I think he is a good man	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu yahay nin wanaagsan
I saw it here	Waxaan ka soo arkay halkan
Let me return to you.	Aan kuu noqdo.
It's just good, really good.	Kaliya waa fiican tahay, runtii aad u fiican.
It's just me.	Aniga kaliya waa aniga.
I just need to work on it	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo
I never saw him again	Mar dambe maan arag
I was surprised she was here.	Waxaan la yaabay inay halkan tahay.
Nothing was left out.	Ma jirin wax meesha ka baxay.
You can talk to him later.	Mar dambe ayaad la hadli kartaa.
I heard what you have to say	Waxaan maqlay waxaad leedahay
I think that's right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay
I looked good	Si fiican ayaan u eegay
You can go	Waad tagi kartaa
I was surprised and surprised	Waan yaabay oo la dhacay
There was no luck.	Wax nasiib ah ma jirin.
Take as much as you need.	Qaado inta aad u baahan tahay.
Everything is well laid out.	Wax walba si fiican ayaa loo dhigay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
I just can't find it today	Kaliya maanta ma heli karo
Let me help.	Aan caawiyo.
I did not want to be here	Ma aanan rabin in aan halkaan joogo
I think we do not	Waxa aan filayaa in aanu sidoo kale samayn
So far so interesting for us.	Ilaa hadda noo xiiso badan.
He has nothing to do with it.	Waxba kama uu qabo.
Everything is correct.	Wax walba waa sax.
I hope you do too !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale sameyso!.
I was one of them.	Waxaan ka mid ahaa.
Not more fun	Ma sii xiiso badan
I heard everything that was said	Waxaan maqlay wax kasta oo la yidhi
I can be here just like you	Waxaan halkaan joogi karaa adiga oo kale
They are both happy.	Labaduba way faraxsan yihiin.
I think so	Waxaan filayaa inuu sidaas yahay
She will not believe that.	Ma rumaysan doonto taas isaga.
Just a little bit.	In yar oo kaliya.
I am very happy about this	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan
I really was	Runtii waan joogay
In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.	Runtii, waxba ma noqon karto.
It can be anywhere.	Waxay noqon kartaa meel kasta.
Few were also observed.	Wax yar sidoo kale la arkay.
I don't think you have anything to do with it.	Uma maleynayo inaad wax ku leedahay.
I would love to do things like that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo sidaas oo kale ah.
That was the whole place.	Taasi waxay ahayd meesha oo dhan.
I did not believe him	Maan rumaysan isaga
I want to go out there and help people	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas ka baxo oo aan caawiyo dadka
I can pick up a job here	Waxaan ka soo qaadan karaa shaqo halkan
I like to do it	Waxaan jeclahay inaan sameeyo
Not sure what to do about it.	Ma hubo waxa aan ka samaynayo.
You have always been.	Had iyo jeer waxaad ahayd.
Get out of here.	Ka bixi.
It looks good, for sure.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan, hubaal.
Three other people.	Saddex qof oo kale.
Better than any she already had.	Si ka fiican mid kasta oo ay hore u lahayd.
I could not do anything	Waxba maan qaban karin
I was there now	hadda waan joogay
I knew someone knew	Waan ogaa in qof uu wax garanayo
That was done.	Taasi waa la sameeyay.
I need it somewhere else	Meel kale ayaan uga baahanahay
I can't say anything about that	Taas waxba kama odhan karo
I still can't say anything	Weli waxba ma odhan karo
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma yeeli doono
I wanted time to talk to you	Waxaan rabay wakhti aan kula hadlo
Can anyone help me please.	Qofna ma iga caawin karaa fadlan.
I wanted to do something hard	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax adag
She is good at that.	Way ku fiican tahay taas.
It can be anything.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
It really is a good job.	Runtii waa shaqo fiican.
But she would, one day.	Laakiin way yeeli lahayd, maalin.
He wants to talk to you.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu kula hadlo.
I did not know you	Maan ogayn adiga
Nice to see you here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko halkan
But he saw that it did not need to be done.	Laakiin wuxuu arkay inaan loo baahnayn in la sameeyo.
I know something good will come out of this	Waxaan ogahay in wax wanaagsan uu ka soo bixi doono arrintan
He looked at the house.	Waxa uu eegay guriga.
What we are doing now is this.	Waxa aan hadda samayno waa kan.
One more chance I get.	Hal fursad oo kale aan helo.
What I looked at is all right	Waxaan eegay oo dhan waa sax
I will not give you anything again	Wax dambe ku siin maayo
Including this.	Oo ay ku jirto kan.
I always do	Had iyo jeer waan sameeyaa
Maybe I would say so	Malaha sidaas ayaan odhan lahaa
I started talking again	Waxaan bilaabay inaan mar kale hadlo
I did not want him to say it again	Maan rabin inuu mar kale sheego
I thought he could help	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku caawin karo
That's exactly what I need.	Waa sax waxa aan u baahanahay.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I thought you would be fine	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad fiicnaan doonto
I'll get it later.	Waqti dambe ayaan heli doonaa.
I often think that.	Waxaan inta badan u maleynayaa in.
I wanted to keep it that way	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas ku sii hayo
I know I don't spend much time together	Waan ogahay in aanan waqti badan isla qaadan
I heard it was really interesting	Waxaan maqlay in runtii aad u xiiso badan
I decided, tomorrow will be a good day	Waxaan go'aansaday, berrito waxay noqon doontaa maalin wanaagsan
He had a lot to say.	Wuxuu lahaa wax badan oo uu u sheego.
Even if it were good.	Xitaa haddii ay fiicnaan lahayd.
I had to find out what was going on	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa jira
He did not want to be there and help anyone.	Ma uu rabin inuu joogo oo cidna caawiyo.
I want to see you now	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko hadda
He had a better idea.	Waxa uu lahaa fikrad ka wanaagsan.
As far as I know nothing like it has happened before.	Sida aan ogahay ma jiro wax la mid ah oo hore u dhacay.
I think it would be a little better for me.	Waxaan filayaa in wax yar ay ii fiicnaan lahayd.
He had so much.	Aad u badan ayaa lahaa.
I want to leave here soon.	Waxaan rabaa inaan dhawaan halkan ka baxo.
I can tell they don't really like me	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inaysan runtii taas aniga iga jeclayn
After.	Ka dib markii.
I can't let you do that	Ma ogolaan karo inaad taas sameyso
Clear as it can be.	Cad sida ay noqon karto.
I really wanted to	Aad ayaan u rabay
I am very happy to do this	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan tan sameeyo
I will not really tell you.	Dhab ahaan kuu sheegi maayo.
There are no problems yet.	Wax dhibaato ah wali ma jiraan.
he will return to me.	wuu ii soo noqon doonaa.
I hope he found you well	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu si fiican kuu helay
I want everything you can get	Waxaan rabaa wax kasta oo aad ku heli karto
He had to find out who she was.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado cidda ay tahay.
You can tell.	Waad sheegi kartaa.
He said he was also sorry.	Waxa uu yidhi sidoo kale waan ka xumahay.
New things every day.	Waxyaabo cusub maalin kasta.
No problem, he said.	Wax dhib ah maaha, ayuu yidhi.
I'm not here, you really	Anigu ma joogo halkan, aad runtii
It does not end here.	Halkan kuma eka.
This will be faster than before.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid degdeg ah kii hore.
They do not.	Ma sameeyaan.
I am back, somewhere I have not seen	Dib baan u joogaa, meel aan arag
I like to eat	Waxaan jeclahay inaan cuno
There is a lot of this going on.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo tan ka mid ah oo socda.
There is much more to be said for the latter.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo tan dambe laga sheegi karo.
She had no money.	Wax lacag ah ma ay haysan.
That is you.	Taasi waa adiga.
But here are some things you can do.	Laakiin halkan waxaa ah waxyaabo aad sameyn kartid.
I did that, now.	Taas ayaan sameeyay, hadda.
Probably nothing.	Malaha waxba maaha.
There is no way it can happen.	Ma jirto si ay u dhici karto.
Same as well.	Oo la mid ah sidoo kale.
I thought we could do one	Waxaan mooday inaan mid ku samayn karno
They are not here.	Ma jiraan halkan.
I love having you here	Waxaan jeclahay inaan halkaan kugu haysto
Not you	Adiga maaha
Pick an older man.	Nin ka weyn soo qaado.
This was later made one	Tan markii dambe laga dhigay hal
But for me, it is no longer.	Laakiin aniga, mar dambe maaha.
I am not alone.	Kaliya ma ihi.
Happened.	Ku dhacay.
I would still like to do that	Weli waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas sameeyo
That was probably the reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd malaha sababta.
All we need is a good man.	Waxa kaliya ee aan u baahanahay waa nin wanaagsan.
This is why it cannot be given.	Tani waa sababta aan la siin karin.
They just didn’t want trouble.	Kaliya ma ay rabin dhibaato.
It doesn't matter if you need something or not.	Dhib malaha inaad wax u baahan tahay iyo in kale.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
It will come in time.	Waxay iman doontaa waqti.
I think they are very happy	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad ugu faraxsan yihiin
This was not done.	Tan lama samayn.
I didn't want to know.	Ma rabin in aan ogaado.
I want you to know that you are not alone	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato inaadan keligaa ahayn
But, it is nothing new.	Laakiin, wax cusub maaha.
This will stop soon.	Tani waxay joojin doontaa dhawaan.
I have to know everything.	Waa inaan wax walba garanayaa.
I have a lot of time and always do a lot	Waxaan helay waqti badan oo had iyo jeer wax badan sameeyo
I hope she finds you in good spirits	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku heli doonto niyad wanaagsan
Everything is bigger than me.	Wax walba waa iga weyn yihiin.
Not everyone gets it.	Ma aha qof walba inuu ku helo.
I do not know why I am here	Ma garanayo sababta aan halkan u joogo
She had a long time.	Waxay lahayd muddo dheer.
He came out and really did.	Wuu soo baxay oo runtii sameeyay.
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
I told him everything	Wax walba waan u sheegay
He got it.	Wuu helay.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wax aad ka qaban karto ma jirto.
I know he wants to help.	Waan ogahay inuu doonayo inuu caawiyo.
He has to be good.	Waa inuu wanaagsan yahay.
It did not turn out well.	Si fiican uma ay noqon.
I think the same.	Waxaan qabaa isku mid.
No one will believe he actually returned until he actually returned.	Qofna ma rumaysan doono inuu dhab ahaantii soo noqday ilaa uu dhab ahaantii soo noqday.
Let it go.	Ha iska tago.
You can do almost anything you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa inta badan wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I wanted to know everything	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ogaado
I thought you would say that	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad sidaas odhan lahayd
Anything.	Wax ka mid ah.
I'm not sure if that is true.	Ma hubo inay taasi run tahay.
Once done, it is done.	Mar haddii la sameeyo, waa la sameeyaa.
I think this is one of them	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ka mid tahay
It was no small feat	Wax yar ma ahayn
I could not find a way out	Meel aan ka baxo maan arki karin
But really no one knew much about him.	Laakiin runtii qofna wax badan kama ogayn isaga.
I have not gone yet	Wali ma tagin
we will see him.	waan arki doonaa isaga.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
It's like you said before.	Waa sida aad hore u sheegtay.
I know she did.	Waan ogahay inay samaysay.
That was very interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I had the same	Waxaan lahaa mid la mid ah
I can give you what you need	Waxaan ku siin karaa waxaad u baahan tahay
Something beautiful, obviously.	Wax qurux badan, iska cad.
It's great to see that.	Aad bay u fiican tahay in la arko taas.
A little too much.	In yar oo aad u yar.
I really want to talk to you.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo.
I looked back	Dib ayaan u eegay
I am here to help	Waxaan u joogaa inuu ku caawiyo
Beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan.
I have no problem with that	Dhib igama helin taas
It was me and him.	Waxay ahayd aniga iyo isaga oo kale.
I started.	Aniga ayaa bilaabay.
I think that's right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay
I'm afraid to find out	Waxaan ka baqayaa in la ogaado
Everything in it is true.	Wax kasta oo ku jira waa run.
Same thing again.	Wax la mid ah mar kale.
I love it when he does that	Waan jeclahay marka uu taas sameeyo
I was not always there	Had iyo jeer ma aan joogin halkaas
But one, it is a small place.	Laakiin mid, waa meel yar.
Only it is kept.	Kaliya waa la hayaa.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
I have to know everything	Waa inaan wax walba garanayaa
Who would have thought.	Yaa u malayn lahaa.
He pretended nothing.	Waxba wuu iska dhigay.
I knew it was for me	Waan ogaa inay aniga ii ahayd
Do you have.	Ma waxaad leedahay.
I have no problem with that.	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo taas.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.	Waan ka xumahay inaan ahay qofka aan kuu sheego.
I do not like to leave him too long	Ma jecli in aan ka tago isaga oo aad u dheer
I was very impressed	Aad baan ula dhacay
I was already there.	Hore ayaan u joogay.
I was really impressed	Runtii aad baan ula dhacay
This was where she was really happy.	Tani waxay ahayd meesha ay runtii ku faraxsan tahay.
Why is it great.	Waa maxay sababta ay u weyn tahay.
You can do it if you want.	Waad samayn kartaa haddii aad rabto.
They will win.	Way guulaysan doonaan.
He could not see anyone.	Cidna uma uu arki karin.
I think that is everything	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay wax walba
I would stop	waan joojin lahaa
I have never seen it that way	Weligay sidaas uma arag
He looked at me again.	Mar kale ayuu i eegay.
I have to stay somewhere	Waa inaan meel joogo
But perhaps that is not true.	Laakiin malaha taasi sax maaha.
.	.
He wanted something else.	Wax kale ayuu rabay.
That could be him.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa isaga.
I put it that way.	Taas ayaan u dhigay.
I rejected whatever he was, whatever he was	Waxaan diiday wax kasta oo uu yahay, wax kasta oo uu ahaa
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
I have to know he is there.	Waa inaan ogaado inuu halkaas joogo.
I picked it up and looked at it all	Waan soo qaaday oo wada eegay
Nothing else.	Wax kale maaha.
For a while nothing was said.	Muddo yar waxba lama odhan.
There was nothing here.	Ma jirin wax halkan ka jira.
I should not have done that	Ma ahayn inaan taas sameeyo
I wondered what this could be	Waxaan la yaabay waxa tani noqon karto
I want to know what he really was up to	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado waxa uu run ahaantii ku jiray
I will not do much about this	Wax weyn ka yeeli maayo arrintan
I could not figure out what was in it	Waan awoodi waayay inaan ogaado waxa ku jira
I don't think so.	U malayn maayo inay taasi tahay.
This was bad.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xun.
I have been here for over a year	Waxaan halkan joogay in ka badan hal sano
I know less than you	Waan ogahay wax ka yar adiga
I still have that.	Weli taas ayaan hayaa.
I love that !.	waan jeclahay taas!.
It was never found.	Waligiis lama helin.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
Maybe he has another one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu mid kale haysto.
I just need to know that it is there	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inay halkaas jirto
That's a lot of money for us.	Taasi waa lacag noo badan.
Everything is if.	Wax walba waa haddii.
Maybe I should have told him earlier	Malaha waxay ahayd inaan hore ugu sheego
She loves me very much.	Aad iyo aad bay ii jeceshahay.
Very, very good.	Aad iyo aad u fiican.
I would go back	Waan ku noqon lahaa
I knew nothing	Waxba kama ogayn
How fun.	Sidee xiiso badan.
I can do that, you know	Taas waan samayn karaa, waad ogtahay
I did not want to leave him alone.	Ma aanan rabin in aan isaga keligiis ka tago.
I wanted to be someone else	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo qof kale
I love helping people in need	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo dadka baahan
But no one is sure.	Laakiin qofna ma hubo.
They may be small.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay yar yihiin.
Everyone knows you are there.	Qof walba waa ogyahay inaad halkaas joogto.
I really wish it would be different.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay si kale ahaan lahayd.
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
I think she did the same for him	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas oo kale u samaysay isaga
Nice place to stay.	Meel fiican oo la joogo.
I have never seen anyone like it.	Weligay ma arag qof sidaas oo kale ah.
I don't know how we can do that.	Ma garanayo sida aan taas u samayn karno.
I know you are a busy man.	Waan ogahay inaad tahay nin mashquul badan.
They will find him.	Way heli doonaan isaga.
No matter what it is.	Dhib malaha waxa ay tahay.
No one had any money.	Qofna wax lacag ah ma haysan.
Anyone can say something.	Qof kastaa wax buu odhan karaa.
I knew something was wrong with you	Waan ogaa inay wax kugu jiraan
She did not like it.	Ma ay jeclayn.
I want to do it	Waxaan rabaa in aan sameeyo
Always.	Had iyo jeer.
No one spoke	Qofna lama hadlin
I should have told you this first	Waxay ahayd inaan tan hore kuu sheego
I tried to do that	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sidaas sameeyo
I thought you know	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ogaato
I can't believe they are still something	Ma rumaysan karo inay weli wax yihiin
I need to know what he will say	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxa uu odhan doono
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
I wonder what he says? 	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu leeyahay?
he wondered	ayuu is waydiiyay
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
I can't talk.	Ma wada hadli karo.
He was smart.	Wuxuu ahaa caqli badan.
That was probably the biggest.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd tan ugu weyn.
He was not there to leave.	Ma jirin si uu u baxo.
I will not tell him anything	waxba u sheegi maayo
I could not really say	Si dhab ah uma sheegi karin
I need your help	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad iga caawiso
I tried to make one	Waxaan isku dayay in mid la sameeyo
That is what he did for me.	Taasi waa waxa uu ii sameeyay.
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
Enough time for us	Waqti nagu filan
As if he were somewhere else.	Sidii inuu meel kale joogo.
I would like to know	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado
As he looked at me.	Sida uu ii eegay.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
I found he liked that	Waxaan helay inuu ka helay taas
I think you should stay with us now	Waxaan qabaa hadda inaad nala joogto
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kuma eka.
I am not alone today	Kaliya ma ihi maanta
It's really hard.	Runtii waa adag tahay.
If he needs it, he should be helped.	Haddii uu baahan yahay, waa in la caawiyo.
he is good.	wuu fiican yahay.
Everyone went for money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u baxay lacag.
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
I wanted to be with you	Waxaan rabay inaan kula joogo
I know it is.	Waan ogahay inay tahay.
It really doesn’t seem hard.	Runtii uma eka mid adag.
I had	waxaan lahaa
It's you.	Waa adiga.
There’s not much I don’t like.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo aan jeclayn.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
I had to say something but I did not want to lie	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sheego laakiin ma rabin inaan been sheego
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
Not sure but you would do well.	Ma hubo laakiin waxaad si fiican u qaban lahayd.
I think that is true	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run tahay
I said at work	Shaqada ayaan ku sheegay
It has been there for a very long time.	Waxay ahayd halkaas muddo aad u dheer.
I can't say that's a good thing.	Ma odhan karo taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
Everything is well done.	Wax walba si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I got better.	Waxaan helay wax ka sii fiican.
I wonder how often she does that.	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta jeer ee ay taas sameyso.
But a little more is better.	Laakiin inta laga sheego wax yar ayaa ka sii wanaagsan.
Either way, he didn't like it.	Si kasta oo ay ahayd, ma uu jeclayn.
No one had any idea what he was saying now.	Qofna wax fikrad ah kama haysan waxa uu hadda yidhi.
I knew it could not happen	Waan ogaa inaysan dhici karin
I need more time than anything else	Waxaan u baahanahay waqti ka badan wax kasta oo kale
A clear day.	Maalin cad.
I am very sure today.	Aad ayaan u hubaa maanta.
I had no urgency	Maan lahayn qof degdeg ah
They just.	Waxay kaliya.
I had a place to go	Waxaan lahaa meel aan aado
I really don't like it.	Dhab ahaan uma jecli.
But now it is like that.	Laakiin hadda waa sida oo kale.
Like he did nothing.	Sida wax uu sameeyay waxba.
I would definitely go	Hubaal waan tagi lahaa
She will talk to everyone.	Waxay la hadli doontaa qof kasta.
I wanted to know who he was	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado qofka uu yahay
He became more beautiful than before.	Wuxuu noqday mid ka qurux badan sidii hore oo kale.
Not a good idea.	Ma aha fikrad wanaagsan.
Everyone who was here knew.	Qof kasta oo halkan joogay wuu ogaa.
This is the same for me.	Tani waa isku mid aniga.
It contains a lot.	Waxaa ku jira wax badan.
I knew it would not be a new car	Waan ogaa inuusan noqon doonin baabuur cusub
I still haven't found it	Wali maan helin
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
Until recently that was it.	Ilaa dhawaan waa taas.
I have no idea what is going on	Waxaan leeyahay fikrad ah waxa socda
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
It has everything.	Waxay leedahay wax walba.
hold on a bit	xoogaa u qabo
It was still unbelievable.	Weli waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
I would love to do the same	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyo
I will help	waan caawin doonaa
That will be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
I just want to do it.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo.
I have seen and heard	Waan arkay oo maqlay
Everyone knows.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa.
I would have stayed here as long as it was.	Waxaan halkan joogi lahaa wakhti aad u dheer sidii ay ahayd.
I can't see him	Ma is arki karo isaga
Now this is interesting.	Hadda tani waa mid xiiso leh.
I did something else	Wax kale ayaan sameeyay
I felt like I was back home	Waxa aan dareemay in aan guriga ku soo noqday
But that would be the best.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahaan lahayd tan ugu wanaagsan.
There is no other way.	Si kale ma jirto.
Much better.	In badan oo ka wanaagsan.
he is with us.	wuu nala joogaa.
I will take that.	Waan qaadan doonaa taas.
I should not have left there	Ma ahayn inaan halkaas uga tago
I told you it would be	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay noqon doonto
I can no longer take it	Mar dambe ma qaadan karo
He turned his back on you.	Dib buu kaa noqday.
Not what is learned but how to learn.	Ma aha waxa la barto laakiin sida loo barto.
There is little else we can do.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo kale oo aan sameyn karno.
This is a lot of the same.	Tani waa wax badan oo isku mid ah.
I wondered what she could say	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa ay odhan karto
You will.	Waad yeeli doontaa.
I hope you stay	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad joogto
I really could not speak	Runtii lama aan hadli karin
We were just on time.	Waxaan ahayn kaliya waqti.
I could not believe it still existed	Ma aan rumaysan karin inay weli jirto
But they could not do that.	Laakiin taas ma ay samayn karin.
I will do that for nothing else.	Waan samayn doonaa taas oo wax kale ma jiraan.
I know a lot about you	Wax badan baan kaa ogahay
I know there must be something	Waan ogahay inay tahay inay wax jiraan
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
We need more space.	Waxaan u baahanahay meel badan.
I couldn’t imagine now working for someone else	Ma malayn karin hadda inaan qof kale u shaqeeyo
I did not want to be there	Maan rabin inaan halkaas joogo
And I am like.	Oo waxaan ahay sida.
I had to do this.	Waxay ahayd inaan tan sameeyo.
I knew you were there	Waan ogaa inaad meesha ku jirto
Sure, that’s good.	Hubaal, taasi waa fiican tahay.
He was still there.	Weli wuu joogay.
I want to get it	Waxaan rabaa in la helo
Initially there was no problem with this.	Markii hore wax dhib ah kuma jirin arrintan.
It has always been, and always will be.	Had iyo jeer ahaa, had iyo jeer noqon doonaa.
Something worse happened.	Wax ka xun ayaa ka dhacay.
I did that to you	Aniga ayaa sidaas kugu sameeyay
Today was a good day.	Maanta waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
I have to see you tonight	waa inaan ku arko caawa
He saw more.	Wax ka badan ayuu arkay.
I'm sure no one will find you.	Waxaan hubaa in qofna uusan ku helin.
It can actually take several years.	Dhab ahaantii waxay qaadan kartaa dhowr sano.
I think they will do the same.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas oo kale samayn doonaan.
I asked him what he saw	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu arkay
People who are nothing like you.	Dadka aan waxba ahayn adiga oo kale.
I had to do this first	Waxay ahayd inaan tan hore u sameeyo
Long and hard.	Dheer oo adag.
Very happy.	Mid aad u faraxsan.
Maybe I still do that	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan weli taas sameeyo
Now I could not stop	Hadda waan joojin waayay
I haven't had it in a year	Hal sano maan helin
Say, unloved.	La leeyahay, aan la jeclayn.
I thought that was good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi fiican tahay
I think it was right	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay sax ahayd
You've done it so far.	Waxaad samaysay ilaa hadda.
Always unbelievable beauty.	Had iyo jeer qurux aan la rumaysan karin.
No one wanted to talk about it.	Qofna ma rabin inuu ka hadlo.
I had other things to do	Waxaan lahaa waxyaabo kale oo aan sameeyo
I didn't even see that.	Xitaa taas maan arag.
You were a lot.	Wax badan baad ahayd.
I know what that is	Waan ogahay waxa ay taasi tahay

There is.	Waxaa jira.
I could not take this	Ma qaadan karin tan
Sorry, there is nothing we can do.	Waan ka xumahay, ma jiraan wax aan sameyn karno.
There was something wrong.	Waxaa jiray wax aan sax ahayn.
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
I have nothing.	Waxba ma hayo.
I will never lie	Weligay been uma sheegi doono
I was hit by a car.	Baabuur ayaa igu dhacay.
Nothing will come out.	Waxba soo bixi maayo.
And so on.	Iyo wixii la mid ah inta kale.
I just didn’t know if that was the case	Kaliya maan garanayn in taasi ay tahay
I like to have new things	Waxaan jeclahay inaan haysto waxyaabo cusub
I do not know what.	Ma garanayo waxa.
Not sure yet	Ma hubo weli
It was awful too.	Wax aad u xun ayaa sidoo kale ahaa.
She certainly had.	Hubaal way lahayd.
I would not have done anything else	Wax kale maan samayn lahayn
I want where you are	waxaan rabaa meesha aad joogto
Also, it does not look like, he could not.	Sidoo kale, uma eka, wuu awoodi waayay.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Please, do not do that.	Fadlan, ha samayn taas.
But they may not even need it.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa u baahnayn.
You can see how difficult it really is.	Waxaad arki kartaa sida ay u adag tahay runtii.

He told me how he felt.	Wuxuu ii sheegay sida uu dareemayo.
I wish she ate more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay wax badan cunto.

A little earlier.	In yar oo hore.
He was a very tough guy.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u adag.
I need something to eat	Waxaan u baahanahay wax aan cuno
I know who they are	Waan garanayaa cidda ay yihiin
But this is still great.	Laakiin tani weli waa mid weyn.
I want to go home and	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga iyo
I should have known you couldn’t get out of it	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaadan ka soo bixi karin
I could not believe this was it	Ma aan rumaysan karin in ay tani tahay
I tried	waan isku dayay
I had to learn what she knew	Waxay ahayd inaan barto waxay ogtahay
Nothing will happen to him.	Waxba ku dhici maayo.
He will not stay home.	Guriga ma joogi doono.
Maybe you are good at that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad taas ku fiican tahay.
I am in big trouble	Waxaan ku jiraa dhibaato weyn
Not spoken	Lama hadlin
I know you know what happened	Waan ogahay inaad ogtahay waxa dhacay
It may be there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay halkaas joogto.
I need to know if you have	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado haddii aad leedahay

Now I have seen.	Hadda ayaan arkay.
I will always be here for you	Had iyo jeer halkan ayaan kuu joogi doonaa
I saw you.	Waan ku arkay.
And that we need it here.	Iyo in aan halkan uga baahanahay.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
I love you so far, too	Waan ku jeclahay ilaa hadda, sidoo kale
I would love to be here again!	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkan joogo mar kale!
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
We are beautiful.	Waxaan nahay qurux.
No one can do anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn karo.
I have to do the same.	Waa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyaa.
But that could be me.	Laakiin taasi waxay noqon kartaa aniga.
It's urgent, he decided.	Waa degdeg, ayuu go'aansaday.
Which she now knows.	Taas oo ay hadda ogaatay.
It cannot happen here.	Halkan kama dhici karto.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
He says he loves us.	Wuxuu yidhi wuu na jecel yahay.
I think they love me	Waxaan filayaa inay i jecel yihiin
I will do it.	waan samayn doonaa.
I was surprised it would hurt.	Waxaan la yaabay inay wax yeeli doonto.
I did not want to do anything else.	Ma rabin wax kale oo aan ku sameeyo.
He is in good spirits.	Wax fiican buu ku jiraa.
It is not about making money.	Maaha lacag samaynta.
Maybe this is true too.	Malaha waa sax tan sidoo kale.
That was very, very close.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid dhow, aad u dhow.
It must be done correctly.	Waa in si sax ah loo sameeyaa.
It’s the least I can do tonight.	Waa waxa ugu yar ee aan caawa qaban karo.
It is not a beautiful idea.	Ma aha fikrad qurux badan.
Any bad time.	Waqti kasta oo xun.
I should not have gone.	Ma ahayn inaan tago.
We will tell you when we do	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa marka aan samayno
I may not like it but she can do it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan jeclayn laakiin way samayn kartaa
That was a difficult time for us.	Taasi waxay noo ahayd waqti adag.
There was also no car.	Sidoo kale baabuur kuma jirin.
Great place	Meel aad u wanaagsan
Both are numerous.	Labaduba waa badan yihiin.
I want to get to know him	Waxaan rabaa inaan barto isaga
It will not get better.	Ma sii fiicnaan doono.
I will be with you	waan kula joogi doonaa
I had	waan lahaa
To go out with him.	In uu la baxo isaga.
Being able to do things like that.	In la awoodo in la sameeyo waxyaabo sidaas oo kale ah.
I doubt everyone and everything	Waxaan ka shakisanahay qof walba iyo wax walba
I love that.	Waan ku jeclahay taas.
I was surprised to hear that	Inta uu maqlay ayaan la yaabay
He knew very well.	Aad buu u ogaa.
I have never seen him before tonight	Caawa ka hor weligay ma arag
I was surprised it would hurt	Waxaan la yaabay inay wax yeeli doonto
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
I thought you would be here	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad halkan joogi doonto
Obviously.	Sida cad.
Otherwise bad things will happen.	Haddii kale waxyaabo xun ayaa dhici doona.
I don't like being here	Ma jecli inaan halkaan joogo
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa wax yaab leh.
I thought you wanted to know	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto inay ogaato
Not yet.	Weli ma aha.
He said again.	Mar kale ayuu yiri.
I did not want to see	Maan rabin inaan arko
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I wanted to get to know him	Waxaan rabay inaan barto isaga
We can't say tomorrow.	Berri ma sheegi karno.
I was there to eat.	Waxaan u joogay inaan wax cuno.
No one was there.	Qofna meel ma joogin.
It was all beautiful, including there.	Wuxuu ahaa mid qurux badan oo dhan, oo ay ku jiraan halkaas.
But he is not really a bad man.	Laakiin runtii nin xun maaha.
And got here.	Oo halkan isku helay.
That will happen.	Taasi way dhici doontaa.
Maybe I want to do it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan rabo inaan sameeyo
I know why you did it today	Waan ogahay sababta aad maanta samaysay
But there are other things, too.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
I will be right	sax ayaan ahaan doonaa
We are what we give.	Waxaan nahay waxaan siin.

I hope they do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sameeyaan.
I think we can get that, too, over time	Waxaan filayaa in aan sidaas ku heli karno, sidoo kale, waqti ka dib
I just can't get this	Kaliya tan ma heli karo
I did	waan sameeyay
I thought this would be a good time.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay waqti fiican u ahaan doonto.
What, it is.	Waa maxay, waa.
I know you will.	Waan ogahay inaad yeeli doonto.
He must do what he wants.	Waa inuu sameeyo wuxuu rabo.
I told her there was.	Waxa aan u sheegay in ay jirto.
She was a friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib.
He was an amazing man.	Nin aad u yaab badan ayuu ahaa.
I haven't seen him in a while.	In muddo ah maan arag.
It will definitely get better.	Runtii way fiicnaan doontaa.
I lost a good friend so	Waxaan waayay saaxiib wanaagsan sidaas
Great big.	Weyn weyn weyn.
Very well.	Si aad u fiican .
I wanted to talk to you	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo
He will talk to you.	Wuu kula hadli doonaa.
I felt I could not help him	Waxa aan dareemay in aanan awoodin in aan caawiyo isaga
Then download one.	Ka dib mid ka mid ah soo bixi.
Others are busy.	Dadka kale waa shaqo badan.
I do not know exactly.	Si sax ah uma garanayo.
Not an opportunity for that.	Maaha fursad taas.
I really hope you can do it	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyn karto
There are none	Ma jiraan
There is none.	Ma jiro.

I'm sure he is.	Waan hubaa inuu yahay.
I wonder if he knows	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii uu garanayo
Otherwise a good idea.	Haddii kale fikrad fiican.
I'm not sure if this is true.	Ma hubo in tani run tahay.
Not for everyone.	Ma ahan qof walba.
in fact.	dhab ahaantii.
I did not know what was going on until much later	Ma garanayn waxa socda ilaa wax badan ka dib
There was none.	Ma jirin.
After a while, no one spoke.	Muddo ka dib, qofna lama hadli jirin.
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
Everything you need.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
He wanted everything.	Wax walba wuu rabay.
I think he would all like it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dhammaan jeclaan lahaa
I do not, but what is it.	Ma sameeyo, laakiin waa maxay.
It was a good thing.	Waxay ahayd wax fiican.
It was definitely very popular.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad loo jecel yahay.
So far, so good.	Ilaa hadda, wanaagsan.
He had a problem.	Dhib buu lahaa.
I know there are things that have to be said	Waan ogahay inay jiraan waxyaabo ay tahay in la sheego
It was not all a lie.	Dhammaan been ma ahayn.
He said.	Wuxuu yidhi .
No one came out.	Qofna uma soo bixin.
I did not want to go.	Maan rabin inaan tago.
I knew he would be with you	Waan ogaa inuu kula joogi doono
I have never had one	Weligay hal mid maan helin
I think they are difficult	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay adag yihiin
Do not talk to anyone.	Cidna ha la hadlin.
I told you and I told you	Waan kuu sheegay oo waan kuu sheegay
That was for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la hubo.
I really didn't like him	Runtii maan jeclayn isaga
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
It really is.	Runtii waa.
Much less.	In badan oo ka yar.
I am still sorry for everything it contains	Weli waan ka xumahay wax kasta oo uu ku jiro
Time will not return.	Waqti mar tagay soo noqon maayo.
I know everything, everyone, is all right.	Waan ogahay wax walba, qof walba, dhammaan waa sax.
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
Things are coming up for me.	Waxyaabo ii soo socda.
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
I have no idea, really	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo, runtii
I felt it existed.	Waxaan dareemay in ay jirto.
I really enjoyed that.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay taas.
They did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
I did not want to leave	Maan rabin inaan baxo
You can really do this.	Runtii tan waad samayn kartaa.
She didn't want to do it, in my opinion.	Ma ay rabin in ay samayso, sida ay aniga ila tahay.
It certainly won’t happen.	Dhab ahaantii ma dhici doonto.
I didn't see anything else coming out.	Wax kale oo soo baxay ma arag.
Now he says.	Hadda wuu leeyahay.
Many of us love it.	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaa ku jecel.
He was a hostage	Nin la haysto ayuu ahaa
I know you will not do it.	Waan ogahay inaadan yeeli doonin.
I saw what she did for others	Waxaan arkay waxay dadka kale u samaysay
We are happy for him.	Waanu ku faraxsanahay isaga.
I will be there for you when you need me	Waan kuu joogi doonaa marka aad ii baahan tahay
Making a friend.	Samaynta saaxiib.
You are still very young.	Weli aad baad u yar tahay.
I should not have lied to him	Ma ahayn inaan been u sheego
I have to think that is more likely.	Waa inaan u malaynayaa inay taasi u badan tahay.
To me that sounds like something.	Aniga taasi waxay ila tahay wax la mid ah.
So beautiful.	Si aad u qurux badan.
It has already been done for me	Mar hore ayaa la ii sameeyay
I looked at him.	Waan eegay isaga.
I thought you wanted me	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad i rabto
I still do not believe it was him	Wali maan rumaysan in uu isaga ahaa
Aan.	Aan .
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
he said.	ayuu yiri.
I tried to do something good for you	Waxaan isku dayay inaan kuu sameeyo wax fiican
He was, he was, he was everywhere.	Wuu joogay, wuu joogay, meel walba wuu joogay.
It didn't take long.	Wax yar ma qaadan.
No one could see anything.	Qofna waxba ma arki karin.
That is a good thing indeed.	Taasi waa wax fiican runtii.
I left a lot of friends.	Waxaan ka tagay saaxiibo badan.
I told you what would happen.	Waxaan kuu sheegay waxa dhici doona.
And good thing too.	Iyo wax wanaagsan sidoo kale.
He is very smart.	Aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay.
I would like to tell everyone at once	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan qof walba u sheego hal mar

I need to be with him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la joogo
I refused anything	Waxba waan diiday
There is nothing else you can do.	Wax kale oo aad samayn karto ma jirto.
I need to know that is not true	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado taasi run maaha
Now he would tell.	Hadda wuu u sheegi lahaa.
You may already have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad hore u leedahay.
I have no idea what is in it.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku jira.
Maybe it's you too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidoo kale tahay adiga.
We need more than this	Waxaan tan uga baahanahay wax ka badan
I have so far to go, too	Waxaan leeyahay ilaa hadda inaan tago, sidoo kale
I have to.	Waa inaan awoodo.
Maybe I should find someone else to talk to	Malaha waa inaan helo qof kale oo aan la hadlo
I will need to know more	Waxaan u baahan doonaa inaan wax badan ogaado
Wherever he wants.	Meel kasta oo uu rabo.
It's a bit.	Waa xoogaa.
I wish it was not so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
A little good time, really	Waqti yar oo wanaagsan, dhab ahaantii

It will be done.	Waa la samayn doonaa.
Not spoken	Lama hadlin
We will see again	Mar kale ayaan arki doonaa
That is probably why.	Taasi waa malaha sababta.
I picked it up three times	Saddex jeer ayaan soo qaaday
good day people.	maalin wanaagsan dadka.
I often wonder what he has now.	Waxaan inta badan la yaabanahay waxa uu hadda hayo.
I had to stay with him	Waxay ahayd inaan la joogo
Everything else is left to me.	Wax kale oo dhan waa la iga tagay.
In fact, she would leave to go to school.	Run ahaantii, way ka tagi lahayd inay aado dugsiga.
Someone has to.	Qof waa inuu.
Bigger than me.	Iga weyn.
Maybe he got someone else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu helay qof kale.
Not only the biggest, but the best.	Ma aha oo kaliya kan ugu weyn, laakiin ugu fiican.
But, that was also right.	Laakiin, taasi sidoo kale waxay ahayd sax.
It certainly will not come	Dhab ahaantii ma iman doono
That is a good place.	Taasi waa meel fiican.
It is everything.	Waa wax walba.
A good time was spent together.	Waqti fiican ayaa la wada qaatay.
I have heard a lot about you	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay
It's too bad you can't say the same.	Waxaa aad u xun in aadan si la mid ah u odhan karin.
You know it will always be.	Waad ogtahay inay mar walba noqon doonto.
It could be later.	Waxay noqon kartaa ka dib.

I can't even speak	Xitaa ma hadli karo
Today was beautiful.	Maanta waxay ahayd qurux badan.
Everything more.	Wax walba oo badan.
But they do not.	Laakiin ma sameeyaan.
That was the reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta.
A few years to come	Dhowr sano ayaa soo socda
As she did.	Sidii ay samaysay.
He has three more.	Saddex kale ayuu hayaa.
I suspect this is so.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay tani sidaas tahay.

You can't tell me.	Ma ii sheegi kartid.
How very happy	Sida aad u faraxsan

I really need to have it now	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda hayo

I have to do another one	Waa inaan mid kale sameeyaa
I can have a good time here	Waxaan ku heli karaa waqti fiican halkan
I just don’t do this.	Kaliya tan ma samaynayo.
I can find you	Waan kuu heli karaa
I would never take that.	Weligay ma qaadan lahayn taas.
But it is everything.	Laakiin waa wax walba.
That is what he did.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyay.
I think you are.	Waxaan qabaa inaad tahay.
I think this will do	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay sameyn doonto
There was little talk.	Wax yar baa laga hadli jiray.
It is not the same.	Wax isku mid ah maaha.
But there was more.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
Much may not be said.	Wax badan ayaa laga yaabaa in aan la sheegin.
He may say something about it.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu wax ka sheego.
And a great friend.	Iyo saaxiib weyn.
Maybe he got something.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax helay.
But it is difficult.	Laakiin way adag tahay.
That is really old.	Taasi runtii waa hore.
Tonight they will surely come.	Caawa hubaal way iman doonaan.
I went there today disappointed	Waxaan maanta halkaas u aaday niyad
I am very sure of that	Aad ayaan u hubaa taas
leh.	leh .
They will not stay long.	Muddo dheer ma joogi doonaan.
This is not the case.	Tani maaha sidaas.
I have to do something.	Waa inaan wax sameeyay.
I wanted to do the same	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyo
I have always been the hardest	Mar walba waxaan ahaa kan ugu adag
You know how difficult they are.	Waad ogtahay sida ay tahay inay adag yihiin.
To do so.	In sidaas la sameeyo.
I still can't get it out	Wali waan la soo bixi waayay
I do not know what, exactly.	Ma garanayo waxa, sax ah.
I have tried this before, a long time ago	Mar hore ayaan tan isku dayay, waqti dheer ka hor
Sax.	Sax.
That is what she has at the door.	Taasi waa waxa ay ka leedahay albaabka.
Very busy	Mashquul badan
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
I did not know that anyone else had heard	Maan ogayn in qof kale maqlay
Very large.	Mid aad u weyn.
I do not know what you are.	Ma garanayo waxaad tahay.
Anyone can see it there.	Qof kasta wuu arki karaa halkaas.
I have to leave	waa inaan baxo
I want to see what he sees	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko wuxuu arko
I had to figure out how to be good	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado sida aan u fiicnaan lahaa
I can not be	Ma noqon karo
You certainly can't do that.	Hubaal taas ma samayn kartid.
I refused that.	Taas waan diiday.
he is good.	wuu fiican yahay.
Isn't that like a man.	Miyaanay taasi ahayn sidii nin oo kale.
She did one at school.	Waxay ku samaysay mid dugsiga.
I do not think that is correct.	Uma maleynayo in taasi sax tahay.
They will tell us.	Way noo sheegi doonaan.
I got what he says	Waxaan helay waxa uu leeyahay
I will not be able to go to work	Ma awoodi doono inaan shaqada tago
I fell for it several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan ku dhacay
There is no clear access to it, either.	Ma jirto si cad oo lagu heli karo, sidoo kale.
I think it is nothing	Waxaan filayaa in aanay waxba ahayn
I am here for you	waan kuu joogaa
I don't want to do anything else with him	Ma doonayo wax kale oo aan isaga la sameeyo
That's it.	Waa tan.
Obviously not.	Waxaa cad in aysan ahayn.
If you are ready.	Haddii aad diyaar u tahay.
You do not need anyone to tell you.	Uma baahnid in qofna kuu sheego.
I could not take this	Maan qaadan karin tan
I can stay with you hard	Si adag ayaan kula joogi karaa
I just didn’t want to be known	Kaliya ma rabin in la ii ogaado
I have not done this again until recently	Mar dambe tan ma samayn ilaa dhawaan
It is not very difficult.	Ma aha mid aad u adag.
That’s how they make money.	Taasi waa sida ay lacag u sameeyaan.
I looked out the door	Albaabka ayaan ka eegay
It can't hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli karto.
I need to get out of here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkan ka baxo
He would not let me.	Ma aha inuu ii ogolaan lahaa.
Only one problem.	Hal dhibaato oo kaliya.
I don't want money	Ma rabo lacag
I very much doubt it will come	Waxaan aad uga shakisanahay inay iman doonto
I am even more sure of that today.	Waxaan taas ka sii hubaa maanta.
But it is the same.	Laakiin waa isku mid.
There was no chance.	Fursad ma jirin.
I knew it was me, always me	Waan ogaa inay aniga tahay, had iyo jeer aniga
But it will always be difficult.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
Let's do that again.	Aan mar kale samayno taas.
I did not want that.	Maan rabin taas.
I should have known that you can't hurt anyone	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaadan cidna wax yeeli karin
I really enjoyed it here	Runtii waan ka helay halkan
It did not end there.	Halkaas kuma ay dhammaan.

I just decided to leave	Kaliya waxaan go'aansaday inaan iska tago

I think they are very good, too	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u fiican yihiin, sidoo kale
I could not allow myself to go there	Waan u ogolaan waayay inaan halkaas aado
They did not do this.	Ma ay samayn tan.
I just wanted to help him	Waxaan rabay oo kaliya inaan caawiyo isaga
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
I just took it.	Kaliya waan qaatay.
This is interesting.	Tani waa waxyaabo xiiso leh.
He was just amazing	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya yaab
I haven't done anything in a long time	Waxba maan qaban muddo dheer
I even liked people a bit	Xitaa dadka waan ka helay xoogaa
You will get good money.	Waxaad heli doontaa lacag fiican.
I know better than to do that.	Waan ogahay wax ka fiican inaan taas sameeyo.
That was true.	Run baa sax ahayd.
I did not want to take more	Ma rabin inaan qaado wax ka badan
I will be coming soon	dhawaan ayaan iman doonaa

But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
I am very happy to be back	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan noqdo
Just not mentioned.	Kaliya lama sheegin.
I just do that with you	Kaliya taas ayaan kula sameeyaa
Tell them what needs to be said.	U sheeg waxa loo baahan yahay in la sheego.
I am here to help	Waxaan halkaan u joogaa inaan ku caawiyo
I didn't have to do much	Ma ahayn inaan wax badan sameeyo
Let me tell you why it is good to talk.	Aan kuu sheego sababta ay u wanaagsan tahay in la hadlo.
I want it all.	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan.
I thought he loved me.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu i jecel yahay.
I left before tomorrow.	Berri ka hor ayaan tagi.
I just wanted to do it	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo
But he has to work on it.	Laakiin waa inuu ka shaqeeyo.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
He told you little.	Wax yar buu kaa sheegay.
I want you to say nothing	Waxaan kaa rabaa inaadan waxba sheegin
He did not want to leave	Ma rabin inuu baxo
I love it, really.	Jeclahay, dhab ahaantii.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I don't have much luck here.	Ma haysto nasiib badan halkan.
I wanted him back.	Waxaan rabay inuu soo noqdo.
I can't come back.	Ma soo noqon karo.
I told him everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegay.
That would do.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
I hope you will do the same for me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad fikrad la mid ah iga samayn doonto
I will not do anything for you	waxba kuu samayn maayo
He was ready to go.	Wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu tago.
I can't say what he did to you	Ma sheegi karo waxa uu ku sameeyay
I know it will happen.	Waan ogahay inay dhici doonto.
She lost him.	Way wayday isaga.
I guess he won't do anything about it.	Waxaan filayaa inuusan waxba ka qaban doonin.
I wonder what that was	Waxaan la yaabanahay taasi maxay ahayd
There was a lot of them, too.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo ka mid ah, sidoo kale.
It really didn't matter.	Run ahaantii dhib ma lahayn.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
A long time ago really	Waqti aad u dheer ka hor runtii
I think it is really beautiful	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay runtii qurux badan tahay
he would go.	wuu tagi lahaa.
I love you friend	Waxaan ku jeclahay saaxiib
He no longer wants to be seen.	Mar dambe ma rabto in lagu arko.
I did not have much time	Waqti badan maan haysan
If you are good someone will see.	Haddii aad wanaagsan tahay qof ayaa arki doona.
When he arrived, he disappeared.	Markii uu yimid, waa la waayay.
I saw what she did to you.	Waxaan arkay waxay kugu samaysay.
I knew you could love more than one person	Waan ogaa inaad hal qof wax ka badan jeclaan karto
I am not alone	Kaliya ma ihi
It was what it was.	Waxay ahayd waxa ay ahayd.
I did not know who they were	Maan garanayn cidda ay yihiin
He said to himself.	Wuu is yidhi.
I did not want to get up	Ma aanan rabin inaan helo ilaa
And he was another man.	Oo wuxuu ahaa nin kale.
But, it is not over yet.	Laakiin, weli ma dhammaan.
He does not want to leave.	Ma rabo inuu baxo.
I could not do anything	Waxba maan qaban karin
It will not happen again.	Ma dhici doonto wakhti kale.
I need you to do it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad sameyso
I was there	waan joogay
If you help me, we may be able to get him again.	Haddii aad i caawiso, waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar kale heli karno isaga.
He said, that's right, you know.	Wuxuu yidhi, waa sax, waad ogtahay.
A man came out.	Nin baa soo baxay.
I am always.	Mar walba waan ahay.
I have not received it to this day	Maan helin ilaa maanta
I don't want any more problems going forward	Ma doonayo dhib dambe oo hore u socda
I did not get a chance	Fursad maan helin
This gave me.	Tani wuu i siiyay.
He would always come.	Mar walba wuu iman lahaa.
There is not much you can say about that.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo aad taas ka sheegi karto.
I have nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo aan aado ma haysto.
I think they will.	Waxaan filayaa inay yeeli doonaan.
It had to be done differently.	Waxay ahayd in si kale loo sameeyo.
I am very happy here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay halkan
But you can find it anywhere.	Laakiin waxaad ka heli kartaa meel kasta.
You just have to be better than one man.	Kaliya waa inaad ka fiican tahay hal nin.
This is usually not a good idea.	Tani inta badan fikrad fiican maaha.
I do not understand	Ma fahmin
It is its place.	Waa meesha ay iska leedahay.
Everything he does is amazing.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyo waa yaab.
I did not think they existed anymore	Uma malaynayn inay mar dambe jiraan
No problem, this was a problem he didn't need.	Dhib malaha, tani waxay ahayd dhibaato uusan u baahnayn.
This should also not be surprising.	Tani sidoo kale waa in aanay noqon mid la yaab leh.
Let me tell you what happened.	Aan kuu sheego waxa dhacay.
I didn't think he could do this	Uma malaynayn inuu tan samayn karo
I knew nothing	Waxba maan garanayn
Just that it is one.	Kaliya in ay tahay mid.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
I think it can happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici karto.
He would love to help.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu caawiyo.
So far little has emerged.	Ilaa hadda wax yar ayaa soo baxay.
I just didn’t get it.	Kaliya maan helin.
I think someone told me something.	Waxaan filayaa in qof wax ii sheegay.
He did not want to go home.	Ma uusan rabin inuu guriga aado.
Everyone was surprised	Qof walba waan la yaabay
Now she is gone.	Hadda way wayday.
I have always been smart	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa mid caqli badan
I did not say so	Anigu sidaas uma hadlin
She was there, too.	Waxay ahayd halkaas, sidoo kale.
We are not three.	Saddex ayaan ahayn.
Very, very good.	Aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
Several times for everyone	Dhowr jeer qof kasta
I will be with you	waan kula joogi doonaa
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
I wanted to know what you are	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxaad tahay
I think she would have seen it differently	Waxaan filayaa inay si kale u arki lahayd
Now they are.	Hadda waxay yihiin.
Everything is set.	Wax walba waa la dhigay.
I hope it will happen a long time ago	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay muddo dheer ka hor dhici doonto
It's good, too.	Waa wax fiican, sidoo kale.
That belongs to him.	Taas ayaa iska leh.
No one could arrest me.	Qofna ima qaban karin.
I do not like to see what is happening now	Ma jecli inaan arko waxa hadda jira
I would also like to help	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclaan lahaa inaan caawiyo
It was like.	Waxay ahayd sidii.
I need to tell him not to do that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan u sheego inuusan taas samayn.
I did this several times, and no one helped	Dhowr jeer ayaan tan sameeyay, qofna ma caawin
I can clearly see	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa
Everything will be fine.	Wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
I wish he would not leave me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuusan iga tagin
I know you are busy	Waan ogahay inaad mashquul tahay
I want to know what is going on	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa socda
I will tell you everything	Wax walba waan kuu sheegi doonaa
Probably not.	Malaha ma lahayn.
Nothing was said.	Waxba lama odhan.
But nothing came.	Laakiin waxba ma iman.
I'm really sorry you know	Runtii waan ka xumahay inaad ogtahay
It would be something.	Wax bay ahaan lahayd.
He took one.	Mid buu qaatay.
They may be right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax yihiin.
I was told that this would go away over time.	Waxaa la ii sheegay in tani ay waqti ka dib tagi doonto.
I could not believe it was real	Ma rumaysan karin inuu dhab yahay
I just want to be with you tonight	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo caawa
All very quickly.	Dhammaan aad u degdeg badan.
Good idea, but not very accurate.	Fikrad fiican, laakiin ma aha mid aad u sax ah.
I had something to do	Waxaan lahaa wax aan sameeyo
I want you to help me	Waxaan rabaa inaad i caawiso
It has even been fun for a while.	Xitaa waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh in muddo ah.
I found.	waan helay.
I started a small house	Waxaan bilaabay guriga yar
There is something else, too.	Wax kale ayaa jira, sidoo kale.
I was found, in a new place.	Waxa la i helay, meel cusub.
I really know what I do	Runtii waan garanayaa waxa aan sameeyo
Everyone came out together.	Qof kastaa wuu isla soo baxay.
But he looked so beautiful.	Laakiin waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u qurux badan.
I knew this was not the end of it	Waan ogaa in tani aysan dhammaan
I was one of the newcomers	Waxaan ka mid ahaa dadka cusub
I want to know exactly where you are	Waxaan rabaa inaan si sax ah u ogaado meesha aad joogto
That's right now.	Waa sidaas hadda.
I know him better	Si ka fiican ayaan u garanayaa
There was so much.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I'm not lucky.	Nasiib ma ihi.
Just for me.	Kaliya aniga ahaan.
I want to keep you here.	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan kugu haysto.
I love everything about this	Waan jeclahay wax kasta oo tan ah
But now she could not.	Laakiin hadda way awoodi wayday.
No one can get anything.	Qofna waxba ma heli karo.
Tell them what you think here.	U sheeg waxa aad kula tahay halkan.
I think they will do the same	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas oo kale samayn doonaan
I tried to see who she was	Waxaan isku dayay inaan arko cidda ay tahay
He did something.	Wax buu sameeyay.
I won't be here much longer	In badan ma joogi doono halkan
I thought you would.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad sameyn doonto.
There was nothing to eat here.	Ma jirin wax la cuno halkan.
It was to be expected.	Waxay ahayd wax la rajaynayo.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
But if you can’t get it, it’s not a big deal.	Laakiin haddii aadan heli karin, wax weyn maaha.
I think it was	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas ahayd
Can anyone help with this.	Qof ma ka caawin karaa arrintan.
He knew she had.	Wuu ogaa in ay leedahay.
I thought no one could be there	Waxaan u maleeyay in qofna ma joogi karo halkaas
I could not find another place to go	Meel kale oo aan ka baxo maan arki karin
I looked good	Si fiican ayaan u eegay
I think it is very beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
I think he loves me	Waxaan filayaa inuu iga jecel yahay
I have a lot to tell you and a little time	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan kuu sheego iyo waqti yar
He has everything.	Wax walba wuu hayaa.
I can't say.	Ma sheegi karo.
I hope we will always do	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar walba sameyn doono
This was not a problem.	Tani dhibaato ma ahayn.
First of all, it's better.	Marka hore, way ka fiican tahay.
She would find him.	Way heli lahayd isaga.
He tried.	Wuu isku dayay.
I know they will get better.	Waan ogahay inay fiicnaan doonaan.
I just want to leave	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
I want to know how it is	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida ay tahay
You did what you did.	Waxaad samaysay waxaad samaysay.
They are different.	Waxay kala yihiin.
Not much.	Wax badan ma aha.
I'm leaving now	hadda waan tagi
They are as good as they are.	Way fiican yihiin sida ay yihiin.
I love people who are hard on me.	Waxaan jeclahay dadka igu adag.
I was definitely not a good person	Dhab ahaantii maan ahayn qof wanaagsan
And me.	Iyo aniga.
He told me he would help me.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu i caawin doono.
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
If you don't think so, that's fine too.	Haddii aadan sidaas u malaynayn, taasi sidoo kale waa fiican tahay.
I am with you	waan kula jiraa
That is not wise.	Taasi caqli maaha.
This will take time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
I do not know what happened to me	Ma garanayo waxa igu soo dhacay
Something had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in wax la sameeyo.
Maybe I should go home	Malaha waa inaan guriga aado
Mostly it is.	Inta badan waa.
More time.	Waqti badan.
You can tell it was once so beautiful.	Waxaad u sheegi kartaa inay mar ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
Now everyone has done many other things.	Hadda qof kastaa wuxuu sameeyay waxyaabo kale oo badan.
I want to be there for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas kuu joogo
I was not lucky.	Nasiib ma helin.
I want you to tell me	Waxaan rabaa inaad ii sheegto
But someone was in the room with me.	Laakiin qof baa qolka ila joogay.
It wasn’t too much.	Ma ahayn wax aad u badan.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
You are everything.	Waxaad tahay wax walba.
I still couldn't believe he was with me	Wali ma rumaysan karin inuu ila joogo
I knew he didn't want to be there	Waan ogaa inuusan doonayn inuu halkaas joogo
you did nothing.	waxba ma aadan samayn.
I really like him	Runtii waan jeclahay isaga
I am not	Ma ihi
Do not say so.	Ha u hadlin sidaas.
I knew he loved me.	Waan ogaa inuu i jecel yahay.
I look forward to seeing you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko
They like to stay as they are.	Waxay jecel yihiin inay wax ku sii jiraan sida ay yihiin.
Just give it time.	Kaliya sii waqti.
Maybe.	Laga yaabaa.
This is fast and real.	Tani waa mid degdeg ah oo dhab ah.
It looks like she did it well.	Waxay la mid tahay inay si wanaagsan u samaysay.
I hope it helps me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay i caawiso.
I walked in the door	Albaabka ayaan ka soo galay
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I really don't want to know.	Runtii ma rabo inaan ogaado.
There was not enough time.	Ma jirin waqti ku filan.
There is nothing there today.	Ma jiro wax halkaas ka jira maanta.
tell me that is another matter.	ii sheeg taasi waa wax kale.
I came in, and I was very surprised	Waan soo galay, oo aad baan ula yaabay
I really like this one	Runtii kan waan jeclahay
I can do it later	Waan samayn karaa mar dambe
there we will see you	halkaas ayaan kugu arki doonaa
We will do everything we can to help.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa wax kasta oo aan ku caawin karno.
I do not want to go there again	Ma rabo inaan mar kale tago halkaas
I was given time and space.	Waqti iyo meel baa la i siiyay.
He shouldn't have wanted you.	Ma ahayn inuusan ku rabin.
I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or not.	Ma hubo inay taasi tahay wax xun iyo in kale.
I do not have time for that.	Waqti uma hayo taas.
I really felt like this	Runtii waxaan dareemay inay tani tahay
That is the best thing you can do.	Taasi waa waxa ugu fiican ee aad sameyn kartid.
I really need it now	Hadda aad baan ugu baahanahay
He should not have said so but he should not have been ready.	Ma aha in uu sidaas yidhi laakiin waa in aanu diyaar u ahayn.
Not much to do.	Wax badan oo la sameeyo maaha.
I am very happy.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I will probably not say it correctly	Waxay u badan tahay inaan si sax ah u odhan
What a difficult day.	Waa maxay maalin adag.
I think this is the best.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ugu fiican tahay.
It is not over yet.	Dhammaan weli ma dhammaan.
I hope there is nothing wrong with this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan waxba ka jirin arrintan.
I think we will get better	Waxaan filayaa inaan fiicnaan doono
It is good that you promise me more.	Way fiican tahay inaad ii ballan qaado wax badan.
I can not say how it will be	Ma sheegi karo sida ay noqon doonto
Not small.	Ma yara.
I think it would be a big deal.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan lahayd wax weyn oo weyn.
I heard what happened	Waxaan maqlay waxa dhacay
I know that all very well	Waan ogahay taas oo dhan aad u wanaagsan
I have nothing else.	Wax kale ma qabo.
A little, really	Wax yar, runtii
I was, really.	Waxaan ahaa, runtii.
I do not have to help you	Ma ahan inaan ku caawiyo
Not one man.	Ma aha hal nin.
If he really liked me he would never have done this.	Haddii uu runtii i jeclaan lahaa waligiis ma uu samayn tan.
I think there is something for everyone	Waxaan filayaa in uu jiro qof qof walba leeyahay
I would love to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo
That was all there was.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa jiray oo dhan.
I looked at him.	Waan eegay isaga.
I can do a little more	Wax yar oo kale ayaan samayn karaa
It may never be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uusan waligiis ahaan doonin.
I tried again and again	Waxaan isku dayay mar kale iyo mar kale
We can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karno.
I have a problem with you.	Dhib baan kaa galay.
What's more here? 	Maxaa halkan ka sii dheer?
He refused to do so.	Waa uu diiday inuu sidaas sameeyo.
He was a great man.	Nin weyn buu ahaa.
In fact, it is loved.	Dhab ahaantii, waa la jecel yahay.
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
Good one !!!!!!!	Mid wanaagsan!!!!!!!
This has a lot.	Tani waxay leedahay wax badan.
No wonder.	La yaab uma eka.
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
He didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Ma uusan rabin inuu qof la hadlo hadda.
I thought it was best not to know	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ugu wanaagsan tahay inaadan ogayn
He asked if he could find something.	Waxa uu waydiiyay in uu wax ka heli karo iyo in kale.
You know they are not.	Waad ogtahay inaysan ahayn.
That was what he did.	Taasi waxay ahayd wixii uu sameeyay.
I still want him now	Wali isaga waan rabaa hadda
Maybe he had.	Malaha wuu lahaa.
Little by little.	Wax yar in yar.
Again he said I was sorry.	Mar kale ayuu yiri waan ka xumahay.
I wonder what he is doing now	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu hadda samaynayo
I thought it was really good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii fiican tahay.
And well you should not.	Oo si fiican waa inaadan.
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
It must be seen.	Waa in la arko.
I told you it was bad	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay xun tahay
I could not see how he could	Maan arki karin sida uu awoodo
I decided to eat well and work.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan si fiican u cuno oo aan u shaqeeyo.
I know the people we can be with	Waan ogahay dadka aan la joogi karno
I am really happy to see you	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko
I didn't know you were too much	Maan ogayn inaad wax badan kugu jirto
I need to do it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo.
He was a great man, everywhere.	Wuxuu ahaa nin weyn, meel walba.
I was told that in time she would leave me	Waxaa la ii sheegay in waqti ka dib ay iga tagi doonto
It was something, a real beauty.	Waxay ahayd wax, qurux dhab ah.
It’s just not a great place to be.	Kaliya maaha meel aad u fiican in la joogo.
I will do everything	Wax walba waan qaban doonaa
It's really interesting.	Dhab ahaantii waa mid xiiso leh.
He knew a lot.	Wax badan buu ogaa.
To find out what he does.	Si uu u ogaado waxa uu sameeyo.
All too small, in need.	Dhammaan aad u yar, oo u baahan.
Very hard to work with	Aad u adag in laga shaqeeyo
Tell us what we can do better.	Noo sheeg waxa aan ka fiicnaan karno.
It's hard to tell me	Way adag tahay in la ii sheego
But no one will believe it.	Laakiin qofna ma rumaysan doono.
I really want her to know what’s going on	Runtii waxaan rabaa inay ogaato waxa socda
She had everything I needed.	Waxay lahayd wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay.
In fact, that is likely to still be true.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waxay u badan tahay inay weli run noqon doonto.
We live once.	Waxaan nool nahay hal mar.
I had no job	Maan lahayn shaqo
I have tried many things	Waxaan isku dayay waxyaabo badan
I can't say enough about that	Taas ku filan ma sheegi karo
I like to know something about people like him	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax ka ogaado dadka isaga oo kale ah
He is a new man.	Waa nin hor leh.
And there he saw.	Oo halkaas ku arkay.
I want to help you	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
I did not know if she was happy or not	Maan garanayn inay ku faraxsan tahay iyo in kale
If you need more, just tell us.	Haddii aad u baahan tahay wax badan, kaliya noo sheeg.
Maybe that would be good for us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi noo fiicnaan lahayd.
He is good at that.	Taas wuu ku fiican yahay.
I can do it again	Mar kale ayaan samayn karaa
I thought you should know	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad ogaato
I did not give anything	Waxba ma siin
Everyone does great things.	Qof kastaa wuxuu sameeyaa wax weyn.
I would love to work again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale shaqeeyo
For me.	Aniga ahaan.
I thought it would be done differently.	Waxaan u maleeyay in si kale loo sameeyo.
Now I know this is not true	Hadda waxaan ogahay in tani aysan run ahayn
I was the one he wanted	Waxaan ahaa kii uu rabay
There was very little time, and much to say.	Waxaa jiray waqti aad u yar, iyo wax badan in la sheego.
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
Not sure what to do with it	Ma hubo waxa aan ka sameeyo
I would also like to do.	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo.
I started to come back	Waxaan bilaabay inaan soo noqdo
I think probably.	Waxaan filayaa inay u badan tahay.
It cannot be true.	Run ma noqon karto.
I wonder why that is	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta taasi tahay
I need to stay later	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sii joogo ka dib
It was what it was.	Waxay ahayd waxay ahayd.
Maybe it can help me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay i caawin karto.
Very good, very good.	Aad ayuu u wanaagsan yahay, aad ayuu u wanaagsan yahay.
I do not know why he did it	Ma garanayn sababta uu sidaas u sameeyay
I will always love you	Mar walba waan ku jeclaan doonaa
I found myself here	Waxaan isku arkay halkan
It is long.	Way dheer tahay.
Don't even think about it.	Xitaa taas ha u malayn.
I heard it clearly and precisely	Waxaan ku maqlay si cad oo sax ah
It was not yet three.	Weli saddex ma ahayn.
Each of them.	Mid kasta oo ka mid ah.
He was another man.	Nin kale ayuu ahaa.
This is a great place.	Tani waa meel aad u fiican.
Only once.	Hal mar kaliya.
It's you	Waa adiga
I am very sorry	Aad baan uga xumahay
I would like you to tell me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad ii sheegto
I just need to get it	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo
I have always been here	halkaan ayaan joogay mar walba
I hope you can see what he is able to do.	Waxaan filayaa inaad arki karto waxa uu awoodo inuu sameeyo.
It would be hard to be otherwise.	Way adag tahay inay si kale ahaan lahayd.
He’s not a bad guy, really.	Ma aha nin xun, runtii.
I can do better	Wax ka fiican ayaan samayn karaa
I have not been there for a long time	Maan joogin halkaas wakhti dheer
You can see why.	Waad arki kartaa sababta.
I did not tell him	Uma aan sheegin
Not everyone.	Ma aha qof walba.
I want to see everything good in person.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba oo wanaagsan ku arko qofka.
I could not tell you that.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegi waayay.
Maybe that was what he would do.	Malaha taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu samayn lahaa.
Now, I'm not sure why she did that.	Hadda, ma hubo sababta ay sidaas u samaysay.
I would be happy if this was the case.	Waan ku faraxsanahay haddii ay tani sidaas ahayd.
I'll see you tonight	waan ku arki doonaa caawa
I was placed here.	halkaan ayaa la i dhigay.
I will not do it	Maan yeeli doonin
It's an amazing place.	Waa meel yaab leh.
We were not ready to do that again	Diyaar uma ahayn inaan taas mar kale samayno
I got a great job.	Waxaan helay shaqo aad u fiican.
I can't help it there	Halkaas kuma caawin karo
Each of these.	Mid kasta oo tan ah.
I love what we do here	Waan jeclahay waxa aan halkan ku samayno
He said he wanted the job.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu doonayo shaqada.
And he looked at it.	Oo sidaas buu u eegay.
I wanted to go.	Waxaan rabay inaan tago.
Now he had.	Hadda oo uu lahaa.
I think it can do great things	Waxaan filayaa inay wax weyn qaban karto
I will not tell you anything.	Waxba kuu sheegi maayo.
Wouldn't that be the best?!.	Taasi miyaanay runtii ahaan doonin tan ugu fiican?!.
I really did	Runtii waan galay
I don't want to do anything else.	Ma doonayo inaan sameeyo wax kale.
Probably not.	Malaha maaha.
Now tell me what happened.	Hadda ii sheeg waxa dhacay.
I need to tell someone, once.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof u sheego, hal mar.
I lost everything there	Wax walba waan waayay halkaas
I will not be part of this.	Ka mid noqon maayo tan.
I saw something similar, you know	Waxaan arkay wax la mid ah, waad ogtahay
I wonder what is coming	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa soo socda
But let me see.	Laakiin aan arko.
I am very sorry about that	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
I wanted to do it a little earlier	Waxa aan rabay in aan wax yar ka hor sameeyo
I am home wherever you are	Waxaan ahay guriga meel kasta oo aad joogto
Something similar here.	Wax la mid ah halkan.
I will always see you	Had iyo jeer waan ku arki doonaa
More than once as well.	In ka badan hal mar sidoo kale.
I thought it was you	Waxaan u maleeyay inay adiga tahay
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha.
He will always do it very badly.	Had iyo jeer wuxuu samayn doonaa si aad u xun.
She had to talk to him about that.	Waxay ahayd inuu taas kala hadlo isaga.
But everyone knew what he was and who he was.	Laakiin qof kastaa wuu ogaa waxa uu yahay iyo cidda uu yahay.
I couldn’t see any of the people.	Ma aan arki karin qof ka mid ah dadka.
We need you	Waanu kuu baahanahay
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
That’s amazing, very amazing.	Taasi waa yaab, aad u yaab badan.
Not sure why	Ma hubo sababta ay ahayd
There is so much	Wax badan baa jira
I know him well	Si fiican ayaan u garanayaa isaga
I can't see that he can hurt us	Ma arki karo inuu wax na yeeli karo
The work to be done is still here.	Shaqada in la sameeyo weli halkan.
I hope it will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
I thought I would be good friends	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan noqon doono saaxiibo wanaagsan
I have no idea that is true.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay taasi run tahay.
I have to speak first	Waa in aan marka hore hadlo
I was a good man.	Waxaan ahaa nin wanaagsan.
I started talking.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan hadlo.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
I went into one and another	Mid kale ayaan galay iyo mid kale
We have been friends for a long time.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo muddo dheer.
And free.	Iyo lacag la'aan.
He beautifully does everything right.	Wuxuu si qurux badan u sameeyaa wax kasta oo sax ah.
I will give it	waan siin doonaa
I felt good knowing this	Waxaan dareemay fiicnaan inaan tan ogaado
That should not take long, but we will see.	Taasi waa inaysan qaadan waqti dheer, laakiin waan arki doonaa.
I should have known better	Waxay ahayd inaan si fiican u ogaado
I look forward to working with you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I can hardly believe what he says.	Si dhib ah ayaan u rumaysan karaa waxa uu leeyahay.
I have not seen it yet	Wali ma arag
It had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
Anything available.	Wax kasta oo la heli karo.
I want to be somewhere else, somewhere but here.	Waxaan rabaa inaan joogo meel kale, meel kale laakiin halkan.
This is not what happened.	Tani maaha waxa dhacay.
There was something.	Wax baa jiray.
That was a very good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan.
Maybe I didn't get another chance	Laga yaabaa inaanan fursad kale helin
I can do this if you want it done	Waan samayn karaa tan haddii aad rabto in la sameeyo
I will not say otherwise	Si kale u odhan maayo
I have to do this now	Waa inaan tan hadda sameeyaa
I can't come now, not today	Hadda ma iman karo, maanta maaha
I can come every day	Waan iman karaa maalin kasta
I tried and tried but she could not talk to me	Waan isku dayay oo waan isku dayay laakiin way ila hadli wayday
Someone fell for him.	Qof baa ku dhacay isaga.
I can spend a lot of money there	Waxaan ku bixin karaa lacag aad u badan halkaas
Not much yet.	Ma badna weli.
I didn't have much space	Meel badan maan haysan
It looks so good and real.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan oo run ah.
More than that he saw himself.	Wax ka badan in uu is arkay.
I will not lie	Been ka sheegi maayo
I have no idea how they do things	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida ay wax u sameeyaan
I can't talk	Kama hadli karo
I want to see you regularly	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko si joogto ah
I think I did not speak	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaanan hadlin
I would still like to see it.	Weli waan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko.
Someone saw it.	Qof baa arkay.
It will never hurt	Weligay waxba ma yeeli doono
I need to know more about him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan ka ogaado isaga
I don't know, really.	Ma garanayo, runtii.
He is a man.	Waa nin.
I was not able to find it	Maan awoodin inaan helo
I will do that again.	Taas mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa.
A little bit.	Wax yar oo yar.
I will not be able to help you	Ma awoodi doono inaan ku caawiyo
I can no longer lie	Been dambe maan sheegi karin
Lucky man.	Nin nasiib badan.
I have nowhere to go	Meel aan aado ma jirto
They will get it.	Way heli doonaan.
That was a little to do.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax yar in la sameeyo.
I like good fun	Waxaan jeclahay xiiso wanaagsan
I would love to have it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan helo
I don't think he got one.	U malayn maayo inuu mid helay.
I heard something	Wax baan maqlay
I didn't even have to get a job	Ma ahayn in aan xitaa shaqada helo
He said he was happy to help.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu caawiyo.
I didn't get much.	Wax badan ma helin.
This was another.	Tani waxay ahayd mid kale.
I just can't believe it's true	Kaliya ma rumaysan karo inay run tahay
Actually, you did not.	Run ahaantii, ma aad samayn.
It was too bad to work like that.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun in sidaas loo shaqeeyo.
This is probably not what you want.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn waxaad rabto.
I just hope it’s not for me.	Kaliya waxaan rajeynayaa inaanan aniga ii ahayn .
I hope they do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sameeyaan.
You did not even get the right job.	Xitaa ma aadan helin shaqo sax ah.
Maybe you can expect a lot more of the same here.	Malaha waxaad filan kartaa wax badan oo isku mid ah halkan.
I think that's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run tahay.
And there was more.	Oo waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
I still have a lot to say	Weli wax badan oo aan u sheego ayaan hayaa
I just want to be friends	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiibo noqdo
I get it.	Waxaan ka heli.
And a lot of time.	Iyo waqti badan.
They will not get it.	Ma heli doonaan.
It was not done.	Ma la qaban.
I tried it everywhere	Waxaan isku dayay meel kasta
I just don’t have anyone to talk to.	Kaliya ma hayo qof aan la hadlo.
I can't do anything like that	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma samayn karo
I will not be here to see.	Halkan uma joogi doono inaan arko.
Not a good idea.	Ma aha fikrad wanaagsan.
There is a lot of time now.	Waqti badan ayaa jira hadda.
I thought they could not	Waxaan u maleeyay inaysan awoodin
I want them to do it right.	Waxaan rabaa inay sax sameeyaan.
I can no longer lie	Been dambe uma sheegi karo
There is no certainty.	Wax la hubo ma jiraan.
Maybe more than you need to know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan inta aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
But no one really knows.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo runtii.
I really fell for the job here.	Runtii waan ku dhacay shaqada halkan.
I still can't speak	Wali kama hadli karo
I will come back to you	waan kuu soo noqon doonaa
You told me.	Waad ii sheegtay.
It just doesn't look like it.	Kaliya uma eka.
A beautiful place to be	Meel aad u qurux badan oo la joogo
But it does not look like one.	Laakiin uma eka mid.
I really did not like it	Runtii maan jeclayn
Still not sure why	Wali ma hubo sababta
This is just me now.	Tani waa aniga oo kaliya hadda.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
Maybe some time ago, too.	Malaha wakhti ka hor, sidoo kale.
And that, and that.	Iyo taas, iyo taas.
I don't want this anymore	Ma doonayo kan mar dambe
I owe you a great time this	Waxaan kugu leeyahay waqti weyn tan
I don't seem to be helping	Uma eka inaan caawiyo
He would be given the opportunity to speak.	Waxaa la siin lahaa fursad uu ku hadlo.
I can not say what would happen to him	Ma sheegi karo waxa ku dhici lahaa
It is loved.	Waa la jecel yahay.
I wonder how much you can do once	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta aad hal mar qaban karto
I want to do this	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan sameeyo
He had no job, no job.	Ma uusan haysan shaqo, shaqo ma uu qaban.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
I wanted to know more	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxyaabo badan
As long as.	Ilaa inta sida.
I think that is enough	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ku filan tahay
I think it is good	Waxaan qabaa inay tahay mid wanaagsan
And now I need it	Oo hadda waan u baahanahay
And really even after that.	Oo runtii xitaa ka dib taas.
She told him she was happy he was happy.	Waxay u sheegtay inay ku faraxsan tahay inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
I wanted him to know	Waxaan rabay inuu ogaado
I did	waan sameeyay
We can't say.	Ma sheegi karno.
I have never seen him like that	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale
I want you to take that	Waxaan rabaa inaad taas qaado
I think that is the only thing you really need to know	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay waxa kaliya ee aad runtii u baahan tahay inaad ogaato
And maybe that's the case.	Oo malaha taasi waa sidaas.
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
We can't do it.	Ma samayn karno.
It certainly exists.	Waxaa hubaal ah inuu jiro.
And it is likely to happen.	Oo ay u badan tahay inay dhici doonto.
I want you to always help	Waxaan rabaa inaad mar walba caawiso
He just loves it.	Kaliya wuu jecel yahay.
There is something new.	Waxaa jira cusub.
It was started	Waa la bilaabay
I wanted to go home	Waxaan rabay in aan guriga aado
It was a very, very difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad iyo aad u adag.
That's how he wants to do it.	Taasi waa sida uu rabo inuu sameeyo.
I can see	waan arki karaa
He could not leave.	Waa uu bixi waayay.
I was taken away.	Waa la iga qaaday.
They are small.	Way yar yihiin.
I think it is a great idea	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay fikrad weyn
And how you will get there.	Iyo sida aad halkaas ku tagi doonto.
Everyone would help.	Qof walba wuu caawin lahaa.
He knew he could help.	Wuu ogaa sida uu u caawin karo.
.	.
I don’t know it will be tonight.	Ma garanayo inay caawa ahaan doonto.
Everyone broke up quickly.	Qof kasta si degdeg ah ayuu u kala tagay.
I hope you enjoy it	Waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto
Not what happened.	Ma aha waxa dhacay.
That’s how things are.	Waa sida ay wax yihiin.
I felt lucky to be there.	Waxaan dareemay nasiib inaan halkaas joogo.
Maybe I could be somewhere better.	Malaha meel ayaan ka fiicnaan karaa.
I may not be able to do it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan awoodin inaan sameeyo
I thought there was.	Waxaan u malayn jiray inay jirto.
You may not believe it at first, but it is true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan rumaysan marka hore, laakiin waa run.
I tried to figure out how to do that.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado sida loo sameeyo taas.
I can not say what it is	Ma sheegi karo waxa ay tahay
I was not really there	Runtii halkaas maan joogin
Too much, really.	Aad u badan, dhab ahaantii.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
I will give it	waan siin doonaa
That is indeed true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
I have never had that problem	Weligay uma helin taas dhibaato
I like less and less.	Waxaan jeclahay in ka yar iyo ka yar.
As if it were true.	Sida haddii ay run ahayd.
I want to lie to you	Waxaan rabaa inaan been kuu sheego
I do not know now.	Ma garanayo hadda.
No talk to him	Lama hadlin isaga
I could not think of anything more beautiful than him	Ma malayn karin wax isaga ka qurux badan
I will not be able to tell you	Ma awoodi doono inaan kuu sheego
Everything else belongs somewhere else.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa iska leh meel kale.
Never mind.	Ha u bixin.
I can do what you do	Waan samayn karaa waxaad samayso
No one is able to do that.	Qofna ma awoodo inuu taas sameeyo.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani run maaha.
I think that would happen	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhici lahayd
He should have stayed.	Waxay ahayd inuu joogo.
I do not think so	Uma malaynayo
Not one year.	Ma aha hal sano.
It was, you know.	Waxay ahayd, waad ogtahay.
I would love to see even more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko xitaa wax badan.
You are very lucky.	Aad baad u nasiib badan tahay.
They may still do, but he did not think they would.	Waa laga yaabaa inay weli sameeyaan, laakiin ma uu malaynayn inay samayn doonaan.
I am now.	Aniga ayaa hadda jira.
It can tell you something.	Wax bay kuu sheegi kartaa.
I can no longer see you	Mar dambe kuma arki karo
We can't do anything right now.	Hadda waxba ma qaban karno.
I think this is the same.	Waxaan filayaa in tani la mid tahay.
I wanted this not to be true.	Waxa aan rabay in aanay tani run noqon.
But he wants more.	Laakiin wax badan ayuu rabaa.
I want him to say more	Waxaan rabaa inuu wax badan sheego
I have to do something	waa inaan wax sameeyaa
I knew he would not help me	Waan ogaa inuusan i caawin doonin
So far, no.	Ilaa hadda, ma aha.
And another and another and another.	Iyo mid kale iyo mid kale iyo mid kale.
It just doesn’t matter.	Kaliya waxba kuma aha.
We had to do it again	Waxay ahayd inaan mar kale samayno
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
I have things that need to be done	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo u baahan in la sameeyo
This is just me.	Tani waa aniga oo kaliya.
Very bad for everyone else.	Aad u xun qof kasta oo kale.
And very good.	Oo aad u wanaagsan.
And you can do it at home.	Oo waxaad ku samayn kartaa guriga.
I would love to work	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan shaqeeyo
He does not have to speak for him.	Ma aha inuu u hadlo isaga.
All he wants to do is help people.	Waxa kaliya ee uu rabo inuu sameeyo waa inuu dadka caawiyo.
Of course not.	Runtii, ma aha.
It's a little harder than that.	Way ka yara adag tahay taas.
I did not tell anyone what he did to me	Qofna uma sheegin waxa uu igu sameeyay
That was a while.	Taasi waxay ahayd muddo.
Not yet.	Weli ma jiro.
Who is anyone.	Ma qof yaa.
I knew, too.	Waan ogaa, sidoo kale.
I did not know if this was good or bad	Maan garanayn taasi inay wanaagsan tahay iyo inay xun tahay
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
You can not take it seriously.	Ma qaadan kartid si dhab ah.
She's sorry for what she said, too.	Way ka xumahay waxa ay tidhi, sidoo kale.
I was more than surprised	In ka badan ayaan yaabay
I can't lie about this	Ma been sheegi karo arrintan
Less is more.	In ka yar ayaa ka badan.
This has been true for some time.	Tani waxay ahayd run in muddo ah.
I couldn’t be much better than this really.	Wax badan kama fiicnaan karo tan runtii.
Clearly and clearly.	Si cad oo cad.
I lost	waan waayay
You really are that.	Runtii taas baad tahay.
I have not told anyone yet	Weli cidna uma sheegin
I had no idea this.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysan tan.
Did he do anything.	Ma wax buu sameeyay.
I need to get it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo.
There is so much activity here.	Waxaa jira mashquul aad u badan halkan.
I wanted this done to me	Waxaan rabay in la igu sameeyo tan
Very, very much.	Aad iyo aad u dhan.
But that was before.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd ka hor.
And much needs to be done.	Oo wax badan loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
It looks like one, too.	Waxay u egtahay mid, sidoo kale.
They will probably get it.	Waxay u badan tahay inay heli doonaan.
I have never been there	Weligay halkaas ma joogin
It really is.	Waa runtii.
I felt it was hard for me	Waxa aan dareemay in ay igu adag tahay
I can do it already	Hore ayaan u samayn karaa
I have never seen him happy	Weligay ma arag isaga oo faraxsan
It was a lot, what.	Waxay ahayd wax badan, waa maxay.
Otherwise, there was one.	Haddii kale, waxaa jiray mid.
I hope you can come again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad mar kale iman karto mar kale
It probably doesn’t contain anything interesting.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan ku jirin wax xiiso leh.
This did not happen.	Tani ma ay samayn.
I wish I could keep you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku sii hayo
I'm sure we can go somewhere.	Waxaan hubaa inaan meel la aadi karno.
I should not have talked about it	Ma ahayn inaan ka hadlo
I knew it probably was	Waxaan ogaa inay u badan tahay inay ahayd
Not everyone can take that	Qof walba ma qaadan karo taas
Very well done.	Aad u wanaagsan ayaa la sameeyay.
In fact, it has a lot.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay leedahay wax badan.
I could not find it	Waan heli waayay
I know the place	Waan garanayaa meesha
Can someone please help ??.	Qof fadlan ma caawin karaa??.
I thought that was a good thing	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan
I could not find anything to eat	Wax aan cuno waan heli waayay
And you know.	Oo ma ogtahay.
I need to find a man	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo nin
Not ready yet	Wali diyaar uma aha
Do not believe you can do it.	Ha rumaysan inaad sidaas samayn karto.
Later, not less.	Mar dambe, ma yara.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I thought he was.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu yahay.
I think you should do that	Waxay ila tahay inaad taas samayso
That would be great.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd mid aad u fiican.
I even do that now	Xitaa taas hadda waan sameeyaa
Again and again.	Mar iyo mar kale.
I want to know what you did	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxaad samaysay
I'll tell him, not yet	Waan u sheegi doonaa, weli ma aha
He had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah kama uu haysan.
I was not very ready	Aad diyaar uma ahayn
I just love the place	Kaliya waan jeclahay meesha
I just want to be here with you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan kula joogo
I have nothing to say	Wax aan sheego ma hayo
Someone will take it.	Qof ayaa qaadan doona.
Please take it	Fadlan qaado
I wanted to learn together	Waxaan rabay inaan wada barto
I can get that tomorrow	Waan heli karaa taas berrito
A place you can't imagine	Meel aadan malayn karin
Nothing like him.	Wax isaga la mid ah uma eka.
I would like him to stay home	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu guriga joogo
I was taken.	Waa la i qaatay.
I did not receive it	maan helin
I thought this might be a good place.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay noqon karto meel wanaagsan.
I may be everywhere as well	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale meel walba joogo
I will talk to you soon	waan kula hadli doonaa dhawaan
I got a real job	Waxaan helay shaqo dhab ah
I am happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I think that is a very good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax aad u wanaagsan
I wanted to know, too	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado, sidoo kale
He didn't like to talk about it.	Ma jeclayn inuu ka hadlo.
He is not here now	Hadda halkan ma joogo
He always knows.	Mar walba wuu garanayaa.
To be known.	In la ogaado.
There is nothing they cannot do.	Ma jiraan wax aanay samayn karin.
He is very good at it.	Aad ayuu ugu fiican yahay.
Do not tell anyone where you are.	Cidna ha u sheegin meesha aad joogto.
I have to tell you something	Waa inaan wax kuu sheego
I really need to go home	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan guriga aado
I can do something again	Mar kale wax waan samayn karaa
That was right.	Taasi sax bay ahayd.
She had to.	Waxay ahayd inay.
I have not seen anyone	Qofna maan arag
I can say how bad you want me to be	Waxaan sheegi karaa sida xun ee aad i rabto
That would be nice to see.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd in la arko.
What else needs to be said?	Maxaa kale oo loo baahan yahay in la sheego?.
I really hope you like it	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto
I know you would like that	Waan ogahay inaad taas jeclaan lahayd
I need to know what you will do	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxaad samayn doonto
I can help you with this	Waan kaa caawin karaa tan
This is very bad.	Tani aad bay u xun tahay.
I will leave well.	Waan ka bixi doonaa si fiican.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
A younger man would never do that	Nin ka yar waligiis ma samayn lahayn
I hope you will be there	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad halkaas joogi doonto
I wanted to go home early	Waxa aan rabay in aan mar hore guriga aado
I am here but for a short time	halkan ayaan joogaa laakiin wakhti yar ayaan joogaa
I think that's amazing	Waxay ila tahay taasi waa yaab
I heard you need it	Waxaan maqlay waxaad u baahan tahay
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Oo ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban kartaa.
The bigger it is the better.	Ka weyn ayaa ka fiican.
They were not there.	Ma ay lahayn halkaas.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
I felt you would come	Waxaan dareemay inaad iman doonto
But he still did not understand.	Laakiin taas weli ma uu fahmin.
You will tell.	Waad sheegi doontaa.
It was what he needed.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu u baahan yahay.
I decided to stay	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan sii joogo
I think I will do my best	Waxaan filayaa inaan samayn doono waxa ugu fiican
Now he saw it.	Hadda wuu arkay.
He asked why.	Sababta ayuu waydiiyay.
Which is not necessary.	Taas oo aan loo baahnayn.
I did not know if there was anyone else here	Maan garanayn in uu jiro qof kale halkan
All very quickly.	Dhammaan si degdeg ah.
I do not have	ma hayo
I just did not see it	Kaliya maan arag
I really should know better	Runtii waa inaan si fiican u garanayaa
I thought you were smart	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay mid caqli badan
I know you can get it if someone can	Waan ogahay inaad heli karto haddii qof uu awoodo
Sure.	Hubaal.
I did not know what was in it	Maan garanayn waxa ku jira
I was not ready for the next one	diyaar uma ahayn waxa soo socda
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
To do something.	In wax la sameeyo.
I really wanted to talk to you	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo
I hope we will be friends	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqon doono saaxiibo
I was ready to do it.	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa in la sameeyo.
I don't know how I did it but I did.	Ma garanayo sida aan sameeyay laakiin waan sameeyay.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
Maybe you do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sameyso.
I found this	kan waan ka helay
Maybe I should work for it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u shaqeeyo
I would like to go there soon	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan aado halkaas dhawaan
I had no intention of doing so	Wax niyad ah uma lahayn inaan sidaas sameeyo
I need to be a new person	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan noqdo qof cusub
I want to be owed.	Waxaan rabaa in la igu leeyahay.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiro.
I can do a beautiful job	Waxaan qaban karaa shaqo qurux badan
I did not find anyone	Qofna maan helin
I know where he is	Waan ogahay meesha uu joogo
I have to go to school	Waa inaan aado dugsiga
I will never see him again	Mar dambe ma arki doono isaga
The past is gone.	Wixii hore waa tagay.
I think it was him	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay ahayd isaga
I know what she will say	Waan garanayaa waxay odhan doonto
I still felt a little out of place	Weli waxaan dareemay in yar oo ka soo baxay
I have never seen that before.	Weligay taas hore uma arag.
Not sure, but maybe not.	Ma hubo, laakiin malaha.
Everyone is gone.	Qof walba wuu baxay.
I can always come back	Mar walba waan soo noqon karaa
What happened is correct.	Ku dhacay waa sax.
It is something to be learned.	Waa wax ay tahay in la barto.
It was constant.	Waxay ahayd joogto.
I could not believe what he was saying	Waan rumaysan waayay waxa uu yidhi
The rest are missing.	Inta kale waa la waayay.
There is not enough space.	Ma jirto meel ku filan.
I could not believe what he said	Waan rumaysan waayay inuu sidaas yidhi
Only a great man who would do everything for you.	Kaliya nin weyn oo wax walba kuu qaban lahaa.
That can take up to a year.	Taasi waxay qaadan kartaa ilaa hal sano.
Person to person.	Qof ilaa qof.
I can't find a job	Wax shaqo ah ma heli karo
So far that has been very interesting.	Ilaa hadda taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I told you this would happen	Waxaan kuu sheegay in tani dhici doonto
In fact, even more so.	Dhab ahaantii, xitaa ka sii badan.
He wondered who was still walking.	Wuxuu la yaabay qof weli socda.
I hope you can help us all	Waxaan filayaa inaad na caawin karto dhammaan
I am at home	Waxaan ahay guriga
I was in a good mood	Niyad fiican ayaan ku jiray
Tell people.	Dadka u sheeg.
Everyone would do it, he thought.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn lahaa, ayuu u maleeyay.
Maybe still.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli.
You know, really.	Waad ogtahay, dhab ah.
He could not find anything.	Waxba wuu heli waayay.
Much better now.	In badan ayaa hadda ka wanaagsan.
I came back	waan soo noqday
I don't want to go	Ma rabo inaan tago
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn.
This is now done.	Tani hadda waa la sameeyay.
I know the people who live there	Waan garanayaa dadka halkaas ku nool
I have done it now.	hadda waan sameeyay.
Hold on a little.	In yar isku qabo.
I thought it was hard for you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay kugu adag tahay.
I know what he wants, too.	Waan ogahay waxa uu rabo, sidoo kale.
I could not believe it was true	Ma rumaysan karin inay run tahay
I hope to see more of you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan wax badan ka arko adiga
I saw.	Waan arkay.
It was busy.	Mashquul bay ahayd.
I do not want to talk to you.	Ma rabo inaan kula hadlo.
I am very, very happy	Aad iyo aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
This was here, now.	Tani waxay ahayd halkan, hadda.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I felt so bad to take it from you	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u xun inaan kaa qaado
There are few.	Ma jiraan wax yar.
No problem.	Dhib maaha.
I've seen it before.	Hore ayaan u arkay.
I have seen it several times	Dhowr jeer ayaan arkay
That is new to me.	Taasi waa igu cusub.
As perhaps.	Sida laga yaabo.
Something else to do.	Wax kale oo la sameeyo.
He can still come back.	Weli wuu soo noqon karaa.
I heard they are good too	Waxaan maqlay inay sidoo kale wanaagsan yihiin
A little interest for sure	Xiiso yar oo la hubo
I wish it was not so	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan sidaas ahayn
Better one.	Mid ka wanaagsan.
There is no such thing here.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah halkan.
Much has been left out.	Wax badan ayaa laga tagay.
I should have told you before	Waxay ahayd in aan hadda ka hor kuu sheego
Everything else she needs to know.	Wax kasta oo kale oo ay u baahan tahay inay ogaato.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
I told you that.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegay.
I always thought we were friends, good friends	Waxaan had iyo jeer u maleeyay inaan nahay saaxiibo, saaxiibo wanaagsan
I thought it was more than interesting	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay ka badan tahay mid xiiso leh
I know this	Waan ogahay tan
Not true	Run maaha
You know you can't.	Waad ogtahay inaadan awoodin.
I knew he had heard me.	Waan ogaa inuu i maqlay.
You did not do this.	Ma aadan samayn tan.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan.
In fact, nothing.	Run ahaantii, waxba ma jiraan.
Not just me, but everyone.	Aniga kaliya maaha, laakiin qof kasta.
I'm a little sorry for him	Inta ugu yar ayaan ka xumahay isaga
Sure, he was told.	Hubaal, waa loo sheegay.
I really don't know what they do.	Dhab ahaantii ma garanayo waxay sameeyaan.
There is nothing that any of us can do to help.	Ma jiro wax naga mid ah oo samayn karo si uu ku caawiyo.
Maybe there was something in it.	Malaha wax baa ku jiray.
No one is present.	Qofna ma joogo.
That may be too difficult.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi aad u adag tahay.
But that can no longer help.	Laakiin taasi mar dambe lama caawin karo.
I didn’t break up as best I could.	Ma aanan ku kala tagin sida ugu wanaagsan.
I think he knows now	Waxaan filayaa inuu hadda garanayo
Maybe something else, too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax kale, sidoo kale.
I am a big and tough guy.	Waxaan ahay nin weyn oo adag.
I knew it would happen one day	Waan ogaa inay maalin dhici doonto
I know where you are	Waan ogahay meesha aad joogto
He said it was more beautiful than before.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay ka qurux badan tahay sidii hore.
I need something really bad.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax aad u xun.
Man's house, for sure	Guriga nin, hubaal
You look familiar.	Waxaad u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
Not much work either.	Ma aha shaqo badan sidoo kale.
Much has yet to come.	Wax badan ayaa weli iman.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
I just need to be here tonight	Waxaan kaliya u baahanahay inaan halkan joogo caawa
I still do not believe	Wali maan rumaysan
No one but one person.	Ma jiro qof aan ahayn hal qof.
It requires hard work.	Waxay u baahan tahay shaqo adag.
He was all.	Wuxuu ahaa dhan.
You can do whatever you want to do.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto in aad samayso.
A little small, but nice	In yar oo yar, laakiin fiican
I was with the former	Waxaan la joogay kii hore
Sure, there is still time for that.	Hubaal, waxaa weli jira wakhti taas.
That is true for everyone.	Taasi waa run qof walba.
I want to know what it is	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado waxa ay tahay
I liked it a lot.	Wax badan ayaan ka helay.
I looked	Waan eegay
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
A car is not a person	Baabuur maaha qof
I can help with that.	Waan ku caawin karaa taas.
Maybe there is something true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax run ah.
I hope you are like that	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas tahay
You know you can do the job.	Waad ogtahay inaad qaban karto shaqada.
I didn’t give him much.	In badan maan siin isaga.
I am only one person.	Waxaan ahay kaliya hal qof.
He is here	Wuu joogaa halkan
Tried to see everything.	Isku dayay inuu wax walba arko.
I don't feel right	Ma dareemayo sax
But he says to me.	Laakiin wuu igu leeyahay.
I know where she is	Waan ogahay meesha ay joogto
This is new	Tani waa cusub
I can hardly see	Si dhib ah ayaan wax u arki karaa
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
I did not want to say	Maan rabin inaan sheego
I have better things to do	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo ka fiican oo aan sameeyo
Do not lie to me.	Been ha ii sheegin.
In fact, it was a little earlier than that.	Run ahaantii, waxay ahayd wax yar hore taas.
Nothing is as it used to be.	Wax sidii hore ahaan jiray ma jiraan.
You know we can do it.	Waad ogtahay inaan sameyn karno.
I did not know that it was	Maan garanayn inay taasi tahay
I just didn’t take anything for a long, long time	Kaliya waxba maan qaadan muddo dheer oo dheer
I did not get anything less	Ma aanan helin wax ka yar
I told him that was the best thing right now	Waxaan u sheegay in taasi tahay waxa ugu wanaagsan hadda
Where they live.	Halka ay ku nool yihiin.
It was made for.	Waxaa loo sameeyay.
More than once	In ka badan hal mar
I want to be a good man	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo nin wanaagsan
Maybe it was beautiful once, but no more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ahayd qurux mar, laakiin mar dambe ma.
You can help	Waad ku caawin kartaa
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
There is no other place like it.	Meel kale oo la mid ah ma jirto.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas.
I want to talk about this	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo arrintan
I want what you can give me	Waxaan rabaa waxaad i siin karto
I look forward to seeing you again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko.
I think there is a little bit of that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jiraan wax yar oo taas ka mid ah.
But there is much he cannot do.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo uusan sameyn karin.
It really didn’t come out much	Runtii in badan uma soo bixin
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
I hope it is good.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay tahay mid wanaagsan.
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
I thought he found me	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu iga helay
It's great.	Waa mid weyn.
I want to work part-time	Waxaan rabaa in aan shaqeeyo muddo yar
I had to get out of there	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas ka baxo
I very much doubt it will happen	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay inuu dhici doono
Everyone knows this.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa tan.
What else did I have to do?	Maxaa kale oo ii jiray inaan sameeyo.
I always look forward to working with him	Had iyo jeer waxaan rajeynayaa inaan la shaqeeyo isaga
He does, but with difficulty.	Wuu sameeyaa, laakiin si dhib yar.
They are usually very good.	Inta badan aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I still can't say	Wali ma sheegi karin
Friend what to do	Saaxiib waxa uu sameeyo
There was nothing new to say	Ma jirin wax cusub oo aan sheego
He knew what was coming.	Wuu ogaa waxa soo socda.
I wish it was me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay aniga ahaan lahayd
I had a place to work	Waxaan lahaa meel aan ka shaqeeyo
You can say, you know.	Waad sheegi kartaa, waad ogtahay.
I tried to figure out why.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado sababta.
But it is still a beautiful place.	Laakiin weli waa meel qurux badan.
It is still a bad idea.	Wali waa fikrad xun.
But it is much more difficult than that.	Laakiin aad bay uga dhib badan tahay taas.
I have not seen it yet	Wali ma arag
I knew nothing	Waxba maan garanayn
This is where it should stay.	Tani waa meesha ay tahay inay joogto.
That was a few years ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
I need some money	Waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa lacag ah
I told him, but he did not believe me	Waan u sheegay, laakiin ima uu rumaysan
He is not a person.	Ma aha qof.
I should have known you could do it right.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaad si sax ah u samayn karto.
I was really impressed	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay
I knew the place.	Waan ogaa meesha.
I don't want another one	Mid kale ma rabo
I wanted to get more out of him	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ka helo isaga
No matter what they are.	Dhib malaha waxay yihiin.
He has just come to me.	Hadda ayuu ii yimid.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
Maybe someone can't get it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof uusan heli karin.
I haven't seen him in three years, he said.	Saddex sano ma arag, ayuu yidhi.
I really need to talk to you	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
You can't get that again.	Taas mar kale ma heli kartid.
I'm sure of this.	Waan hubaa tan.
I definitely felt something	Hubaal wax baan dareemay
You should not get anything similar.	Waa inaadan helin wax la mid ah.
It will not be.	Ma noqon doonto.
I really like it, a little bit	Runtii waan jeclahay, in yar
I wanted it done to me	Waxaan rabay in la igu sameeyo
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
He is still out.	Wali wuu baxay.
I told you.	waan kuu sheegay.
He will stay there again.	Halkaas ayuu mar kale sii joogi doonaa.
But you know.	Laakiin waad ogtahay.
I got one.	Mid baan helay.
He would have been here before.	Hore ayuu halkan u joogi lahaa.
I know we are very bad	Waan ogahay inaan aad u xun nahay
This is more than me.	Tani waa wax ka badan aniga.
How amazing.	Sidee aad u yaab badan.
All of this can be true.	Dhammaan tani run bay noqon kartaa.
I am a man of thought.	Waxaan ahay nin fikrad leh.
Everyone fell for it.	Qof kastaa wuu ku dhacay.
I know you would like it.	Waan ogahay inaad jeclaan lahayd.
Great man, good man	Nin weyn, nin wanaagsan
Really, let me help you.	Runtii, aan ku caawiyo.
There is nowhere to go.	Meel la aado ma jirto.
I knew she would go there a lot	Waan ogaa inay halkaas aadi doonto in badan
Here is what he said.	Waa kan waxa uu yiri.
You can't do that now.	Taas hadda ma aad samayn karin.
But there was only one.	Laakiin waxaa jiray mid kaliya.
If you do not, do not.	Haddii aadan samayn, ma samayn.
I'm afraid something bad has happened to him	Waxaan ka baqayaa inuu ku dhacay wax xun iyo
I did not get a chance	Fursad maan helin
I have never been here.	Weligay halkan ma aan iman.
I will not be able to say.	Ma awoodi doono inaan sheego.
But not everyone.	Laakiin maaha qof walba.
I can't do anything about it	Waxba kama qaban karo isaga
I think he is really in trouble	Waxaan filayaa inuu dhab ahaantii dhibaato ku jiro
They are smart.	Waa caqli badan yihiin.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
It's hard to get out.	Way adag tahay in la baxo.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax fiican.
You said you wanted to.	Waxaad sheegtay inaad rabto.
That's how she feels about him.	Waa sida ay isaga la tahay.
it does not look like that.	uma eka sidaas.
I will not pay anything	Waxba ma bixin doono
I have it ready for you	diyaar ayaan kuu hayaa
But this is clearly not the case.	Laakiin tani si cad maaha.
Everything else is as it was.	Wax kasta oo kale waa sidii ay ahayd.
But no one found him there.	Laakiin qofna halkaas kama helin.
I know they can't be me	Waan ogahay inaysan aniga ahaan karin
I knew what it looked like	Waan ogaa sida ay u egtahay
As well as the other person.	Sidoo kale qofka kale.
It will not happen again	Mar kale dhici maayo
I tried to find out what happened	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
It was a lot of money.	Lacag badan bay ahayd.
Someone else will take it.	Qof kale ayaa qaadan doona.
And mostly for you.	Iyo inta badan adiga.
He was not like him.	Ma ahayn isaga oo kale.
And I want to see it.	Oo waxaan rabaa inaan arko.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
That is money only.	Taasi waa lacag kaliya.
I did not know they would hurt you	Maan ogeyn inay wax ku yeeli doonaan
No one wanted to.	Qofna ma rabin.
That is too much.	Taasi aad bay u badan tahay.
Maybe a little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in yar.
It wouldn't hurt, you know.	Ma yeeli lahayn, waad ogtahay.
That is not what we do.	Taasi maaha waxa aan samayno.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
It was true enough.	Waxay ahayd run ku filan.
Hold on	Qabo
I was surprised by that	Taas waan la yaabay
You need to let me know if this is the case.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ii soo sheegto haddii ay taasi jirto.
I always wonder what happened to him	Waxaan mar walba la yaabanahay waxa ku dhacay
Really, that is what it is.	Runtii, taasi waa waxa ay tahay.
Enough close, but not too close.	Ku filan dhow, laakiin aad uma dhow.
There is no such thing here.	Ma jiraan wax la mid ah halkan.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
I need to know he is still alive	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inuu weli nool yahay
You seem to be in trouble.	Waxaad u egtahay inaad dhib ku jirto.
I promised I would love him.	Waxaan ballan qaaday inaan isaga jeclaan doono.
He is a very bad man.	Waa nin aad u xun.
I thought it was nothing	Waxaan u maleeyay in aanay waxba ahayn
You can do it anywhere.	Waxaad ku samayn kartaa meel kasta.
Maybe I can tell you too	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale kuu sheego
It didn't matter what happened before.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn wixii hore u dhacay.
I want something	wax baan rabaa
It is strongly rejected.	Aad baa loo diiday.
I think they are.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay yihiin.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
It’s a great place like any other.	Waa meel u fiican sida mid kasta.
I find it hard to do anything	Waxaa igu adag inaan wax sameeyo
What is it.	Waa maxay.
Very interesting offer.	Bixin aad u xiiso badan.
I'm glad you're here, now	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto, hadda
I liked that even better	Taas waan ka helay xitaa si ka sii fiican
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
A good place for him	Meel wanaagsan isaga
It should not be surprising.	Waa in aanay noqon wax la yaab leh.
Give us more time.	Waqti badan na sii.
I thought it was something to be learned.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax la barto.
I said it clearly	Si cad ayaan u sheegay
I hope you are happy	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ku faraxsan tahay
I wanted to get it.	Waxaan rabay inaan helo.
I couldn't even get out.	Xitaa waan ka bixi waayay.
I would do nothing for it	Waxba waan u qaban lahaa
That's what you had to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay ahayd inaad sameyso.
To find out.	Si aad u ogaato.
This was so much more.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
I think he still does	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu weli sameeyo
I love each one equally	Mid walba si isku mid ah ayaan u jeclahay
It can happen to him.	Way ku dhici kartaa isaga.
I could not get out of here immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan halkan uga bixi waayay
I did not want to hold on	Maan rabin in aan isku hayo
It just wasn't there.	Kaliya ma jirin.
I didn’t think you would really do it	Uma malaynayn inaad dhab ahaantii samayn doonto
"Something came out," he said.	Wax baa soo baxay buu yidhi.
He heard a lot about it.	Wax badan ayuu ka maqlay.
But that wasn’t too bad.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
I can never stay here	Halkan weligay ma joogi karo
Obviously, this is a problem.	Sida cad, tani waa dhibaato.
You do not need to do anything else.	Uma baahnid inaad wax kale samayso.
Nearly taking nothing.	In dhow oo aan waxba qaadan.
I need to work on that	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo taas
He is a little happier now.	Hadda wuu ka yara faraxsan yahay.
I still want to help	Wali waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
I still haven't had a chance to get much	Wali ma helin fursad aan wax badan ku helo
I love how it looks	Waxaan jeclahay sida ay u egtahay
He was as surprised as anyone.	Wuu la yaabay sida qof kasta.
I did not know it was you	Maan garanayn inay adiga tahay
I asked him to leave	Waxaan ka codsaday inuu baxo
I do not know if it is or not.	Ma garanayo inay tahay iyo in kale.
The reason for everything	Sababta wax kasta
I need someone with a real job	Waxaan u baahanahay qof leh shaqo dhab ah
She had this.	Waxay lahayd tan.
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
The longer the better.	Inta dheer ayaa ka sii fiican.
I tried other things	Waxaan isku dayay waxyaabo kale
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
They will not speak.	Ma hadli doonaan.
I have a missing friend	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiib la waayay
But that is not all.	Laakiin halkaas kuma eka.
But this is not all.	Laakiin tani kaliya maaha.
When there is.	Marka ay jirto.
He never did.	Waligiis ma uu samayn.
I want to do it for you	Waxaan rabaa in aan adiga kuu sameeyo
He needs to be.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu noqdo.
I started small.	Waxaan bilaabay wax yar.
Certainly, he said.	Waa hubaal, ayuu yidhi.
This looks great.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
He knows he will get it.	Wuu ogyahay inuu heli doono.
He owed money on every side.	Wuxuu ku lahaa lacag dhan walba.
She picked it up.	Way soo qaaday.
It would be nice if he didn't come back.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii aanu dib u soo noqon.
Everyone wants more.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa wax badan.
Do not leave anything out.	Waxba ha ka tagin.
There is nothing real about this.	Ma jiro wax dhab ah oo aan tan ahayn.
If only it could be so again.	Haddii kaliya ay sidaas noqon karto mar kale.
She said she loved him.	Waxay sheegtay inay jeceshahay isaga.
There is nothing surprising.	Ma jiro wax la yaab leh.
I am very happy to have you.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku haysto.
She did not understand.	Waxba ma ay fahmin.
He could not see anything.	Waxba wuu arki waayay.
And there was something.	Oo waxaa jiray wax.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
There was not enough to do.	Ma jirin wax ku filan oo la sameeyo.
He is really a tough guy.	Runtii waa nin adag.
I wanted to learn more.	Waxaan rabay inaan sii barto.
I think he is still in school	Waxaan filayaa in uu weli ku jiro dugsiga
Anything more.	Wax kasta oo ka badan.
I did not give anything.	Waxba ma siin.
I would love to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
I had no idea this	Wax fikrad ah kama haysan tan
It's like you can't have anything.	Waxay la mid tahay inaadan waxba haysan karin.
I knew she still loved me	Waan ogaa inay wali i jeceshahay
Not that it will last long.	Ma aha in ay muddo dheer awoodi doonto.
I can't be the person you want me to be	Ma noqon karo qofka aad rabto inaan noqdo
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
I found a new one.	Waxaan helay mid cusub.
I don’t know who might, either.	Ma garanayo qofka laga yaabo, sidoo kale.
I could not say anything else	Waxa aan awoodi waayay in aan wax kale sheego
I just didn’t get the right one	Kaliya ma helin mid sax ah
I should not have.	Ma ahayn inaan haysto.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax wanaagsan.
Like him.	Isaga oo kale.
I did not hold him	Uma aan qaban isaga
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
You may want to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto.
More than you.	In ka badan adiga.
Don't go there again.	Halkaas mar dambe ha tagin.
No one would see anything.	Qofna waxba ma arki lahayn.
I’m happy with that, too.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas, sidoo kale.
It was really awful.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It's a lot.	Waa wax badan.
He wondered what would happen next.	Hadda maxaa ku dhici doona ayuu is waydiiyay.
It is the right thing to do.	Waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I have no time for this	Waqti uma hayo arrintan
I could not imagine anything else to do	Wax kale oo aan sameeyo ma aan malayn karin
I can be whatever you want me to be	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta oo aad rabto inaan noqdo
Interesting, very interesting.	Xiiso leh, aad u xiiso badan.
I wanted to do this for you	Waxaan rabay inaan tan kuu sameeyo
I may not get more than one chance at this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan helin wax ka badan hal fursad tan.
I have not seen much	Wax badan maan arag
I wanted to see it all.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko dhammaan.
Do not spend anything.	Waxba ha ka bixin.
No one else will get it	Mid kale ma heli doono
I felt he loved me again	Waxaan dareemay inuu dib ii jecel yahay
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
I found it here.	halkaan ayaan ka helay.
I knew she would do it	Waan ogaa inay qaban doonto
So far so good for us	Ilaa hadda noo xiiso badan
I need to discuss that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kala hadlo taas.
Maybe I get a few more	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan helo dhowr kale
I had to stay	Waxay ahayd inaan ku sii jiro
I'm sorry for him.	Waan ka xumahay isaga.
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayo.
I thought he was long gone	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu waa hore tagay
She would have nothing.	Waxba ma haysan lahayd.
And she just didn’t talk.	Oo kaliya ma aysan hadlin.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
I knew he would like it.	Waan ogaa inuu jeclaan lahaa.
I have an idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad.
I think it may have been abandoned	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo in laga tagay
It was really lucky.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid nasiib leh.
I did not have to leave the room	Ma ahayn inaan qolka ka baxo
If you have.	Haddii aad leedahay.
I was here and I saw it	halkaan ayaan joogay oo aan arkay
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan run ahayn.
He knows that.	Taas wuu garanayaa.
I would love to see that.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan taas arko.
I know, why you have	Waan ogahay, sababta aad u leedahay
I'm sure it's good for him.	Waan hubaa inay isaga u wanaagsan tahay.
I will give it a little time	Waxaan siin doonaa wakhti yar
You have to do the same.	Waa inaad sidaas oo kale samayso.
I was everything else	Wax kasta oo kale ayaan ahaa
They do something and they do it.	Wax baa loo sameeyaa oo way sameeyaan.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
I can't see that again	Taas mar kale ma arki karo
Now I am happy to be here with him	Hadda waan ku faraxsanahay inaan isaga halkan joogo
I want to see people	Waxaan rabaa inaan dadka arko
I have never done anything else.	Weligay wax kale maan samayn.
It was a difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti adag.
What did he do?	Muxuu sameeyay.
I think he wants you	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku rabo
A lot of bad things happened	Wax badan oo xun ayaa dhacay
And it was not him.	Oo ma ahayn isaga.
He says everyone has something they don't like.	Wuxuu sheegay in qof walba uu ku jiro wax uusan jeclayn.
I tried to help	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo
I think this is very surprising and very fast.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay aad u yaab badan tahay oo aad u degdeg badan tahay.
We are good at what we do.	Waxaan ku fiican nahay waxa aan samayno.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
Not very long.	Aad uma joogto.
I have not seen it yet	Wali ma arag
I need to know where you are at all times	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado meesha aad joogto mar walba
We can't have it.	Ma haysan karno.
So far I have no idea where he went	Ilaa hadda wax fikrad ah uma hayo meel uu aaday
I want to know more about you	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan kaa ogaado
There is not much you can do about it.	Wax badan oo aad ka qaban karto ma jiraan.
But this should not surprise anyone.	Laakiin tani waa in aanay cidna la yaab ku noqon.
He should not have done it alone.	Ma ahayn in uu keligiis taas samaynayo.
Now, everyone can do better.	Hadda, qof walba si ka wanaagsan ayuu u samayn karaa.
He can come back to see it.	Wuu u soo noqon karaa si uu u arko.
I wanted to do this already, but did not know how.	Waxaan rabay inaan tan sameeyo mar hore, laakiin ma garanayn sida.
I know what this is doing to us	Waan ogahay waxa ay tani nagu samaynayso
That is what is needed.	Taas oo ah waxa loo baahan yahay.
It was what was done.	Waxay ahayd waxa la sameeyay.
I knew what to do	Waan ogaa waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo
I thought she could do it.	Waxaan u maleynayay inay sameyn karto.
Several others came in	Dhowr qof oo kale ayaa soo galay
What he did to you.	Wixii uu kugu sameeyay.
I think that's right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay
That is where to find him.	Taasi waa meesha laga helo isaga.
I think it would have been much better than him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad uga fiicnaan lahayd isaga.
I went out and looked at him	Waan u soo baxay oo eegay isaga
It probably is as it is.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay sida ay tahay.
It is good for me.	Way ii fiican tahay aniga.
I returned to work	Waxaan ku soo noqday shaqada
I have been there all the time	Halkaas ayaan ku jiray mar walba
There must be something else going on there.	Waa inay jiraan wax kale oo halkaas ka socda.
He did not want to.	Ma uu rabin.
Coming from work.	Isaga oo ka yimid shaqada.
She had me.	Way i lahayd.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I still wonder why he lost	Weli waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu u waayay
I want to do other things for a while.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo kale in muddo ah.
You are much more than that.	Aad baad uga badan tahay taas.
This is the best thing he can do.	Tani waa waxa ugu fiican ee uu sameeyo.
Now it feels real.	Hadda waxa la dareemay dhab.
But it was unattractive.	Laakiin waxa uu ahaa wax aan qurux ahayn.
It was someone else.	Waxay ahayd qof kale.
I didn't get much	Wax badan kama helin
Not much now.	Ma aha wax badan hadda.
Now something is going on for me	Hadda wax baa ii socda
I want him back to what he was before	Waxaan rabaa in uu ku soo noqdo sidii uu markii hore ahaa
I was really surprised by that, too	Runtii si degdeg ah ayaan taas ula yaabay, sidoo kale
I need to get out of there	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas ka baxo
All he had to do was go to school.	Waxa kaliya ee ay ahayd inuu sameeyo waxay ahayd inuu aado dugsiga.
But he did not do this.	Laakiin ma uusan samayn tan.
I just have it for you	Waxa aan kuu hayaa kaliya
It was really tonight.	Waxay ahayd runtii caawa.
I did well	si fiican ayaan u sameeyay
You will tell them she did the right thing.	Waxaad u sheegi doontaa inay samaysay wax sax ah.
I thought something terrible had happened to you	Waxaan u maleeyay in wax aad u xun kugu dhacay
I did not want to do anything big	Maan rabin in aan wax weyn ka sameeyo
I really didn't think he was here	Runtii uma malaynayn inuu halkan joogo
I hope they will help us	Waxaan filayaa inay na caawin doonaan
He looked back.	Dib buu u eegay.
I wonder how you are	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida aad tahay
He did not see the place.	Meesha kuma uu arag.
It is non-existent.	Waa wax aan jirin.
I tried.	Waan isku dayay.
Whatever you want is.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto waa.
It seems they don't.	Waxay u egtahay inaysan samayn.
I hope everyone had a good time	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu waqti fiican qaatay
I should not have said anything	Ma ahayn inaan wax sheego
I can’t get to do much.	Ma heli karo inaan sameeyo wax badan.
But that may not be right.	Laakiin taasi sax ma noqon karto.
That was no problem now.	Taasi hadda dhib ma lahayn.
He could no longer afford it.	Mar dambe ma uusan awoodin.
I have not always been an adult	Mar walba maan ahayn qof weyn
I need to get it all.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wada helo.
All badly known.	Dhammaan si xun loo yaqaan.
I'm still sorry about that.	Wali waan ka xumahay taas.
It was taken from me.	Waa la ii qaatay.
I want to know everything, now	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ogaado, hadda
He can tell the truth.	Run buu sheegi karaa.
But no problem.	Laakiin dhib ma lahayn.
I was told it was very good	Waxaa la ii sheegay inay aad u fiican tahay
I was always in trouble	Mar walba dhibaato ayaan ku jiray
Give it time.	Waqti sii.
This is probably the main reason why.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inay tahay sababta ugu weyn ee sababta.
I never did.	Weligay ma samayn.
There is.	Waxaa jira.
It really wasn't much.	Runtii ma ahayn wax badan.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
I love it so much.	Waxaan u jeclahay sidaas.
What is missing?	Maxaa meel la waayay.
I would do it again and again and again	Mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa
I don't work that way.	Anigu sidaas uma shaqeeyo.
I felt it needed to be discovered.	Waxaan dareemay in loo baahan yahay in la ogaado.
I know, right	Waan ogahay, sax
He wanted everything right.	Wuxuu rabay wax walba oo sax ah.
I can't do that for him	Taas isaga kuma samayn karo
he knows how.	wuu garanayaa sida.
And what it is, here it is.	Oo waxa ay tahay, waa kan.
I will say it is him.	Waxaan odhan doonaa waa isaga.
I haven't seen it in a long time.	Waqti dheer ma arag.
Living things do not do that.	Waxyaabo nool ma sameeyaan taas.
Really long ago	Runtii wakhti dheer ka hor
I returned home	Waxaan ku soo noqday guriga
I have to do what a man would do	Waa inaan sameeyaa waxa nin samayn lahaa
She did not lie.	Been ma aysan sheegin.
I can see why he thought this.	Waan arki karaa sababta uu tan u maleeyay.
I didn't see anything.	Anigu waxba ma arag.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
I won't say much about it.	Wax badan ka sheegi maayo.
But he saw it.	Laakiin wuu arkay.
You don't need anything else.	Wax kale uma baahnid.
I did not think that would be the case	Uma malaynayn inay taasi ahaan doonto
I know this now.	Waan ogahay tan hadda.
Is he surprised he will return	Ma la yaabay inuu soo noqon doono
They will get better.	Way fiicnaan doonaan.
I wish you luck.	Nasiib ayaan kuu rajeynayaa.
I thought they would for sure	Waxaan u maleeyay inay hubaal noqon doonaan
This was the same.	Tani waxay ahayd isku mid.
I'm afraid it's true, and very lively	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay run tahay, oo aad u nool
I left there	Halkaas ayaan uga tagay
I wish it was true with me	Waxaan jeclahay inay run ila tahay
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
I may not be able to find another job.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan heli karin shaqo kale.
I knew he was happy	Waan ogaa inuu faraxsan yahay
Quick.	Degdeg.
I think it sounds like it should.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay u egtahay sida loo baahan yahay.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
No one will be harmed.	Qofna dhib kuma noqon doono.
It is almost time.	Waa wakhti ku dhow.
It's good, really.	Waxay u fiican tahay, runtii.
I knew you would get it	Waan ogaa inaad heli doonto
Well, too.	Si fiican, sidoo kale.
I want him to continue talking	Waxaan rabaa inuu sii hadlo
Nice to see you just.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko kaliya.
That can happen.	Taasi way dhici kartaa.
I don't want to leave him.	Ma doonayo inaan isaga tago.
This is, again, great.	Tani waa, mar kale, weyn.
Probably not.	Malaha ma ahaan doono.
You are right.	sax baad sheegtay.
It has to work.	Waa inuu shaqeeyo.
I did not really take it	Si dhab ah uma aan qaadan
I think that will end today	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhammaan doonto maanta
I may not be able to go anywhere else	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan ka bixi karin meel kale
you think.	waxaad u malaynaysaa.
She just had.	Waxay lahayd oo kaliya .
There is nothing we can do about it.	Wax aan u qaban karno ma jirto.
I have to even be here	Waa inaan xitaa halkaan joogo
I withdrew	Waan ka noqday
That is true for everyone, including you.	Taasi waa run qof walba, xitaa adiga.
I want to know what it is	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa uu yahay
No one else wants it.	Qof kale ma rabo.
I knew this was going to happen.	Waan ogaa inay tani dhici doonto.
Ah, that's bad.	Ah, taasi way xun tahay.
I am so glad you are here !.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto!.
I just don't want to do it	Ma aha inaan rabo inaan sameeyo oo kaliya
It was small.	Wax yar bay ahayd.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha .
But he loves you.	Laakiin wuu ku jecel yahay.
As much as he can.	Inta uu awoodo.
At first I didn't see anything.	Markii hore waxba maan arag.
I will do something else.	Wax kale ayaan sameyn doonaa.
It was no longer.	Mar dambe ma ay ahayn.
I hold a lot to myself	Wax badan ayaan isku hayaa
That could be it too.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sidoo kale.
I was not one of them.	Anigu ka mid ma ahayn.
I am very good	Waxaan ahay mid aad u wanaagsan
I knew he would do it	Waan ogaa inuu samayn doono
I'm not sure it's a good idea.	Ma hubo inay fikrad fiican tahay.
This is another time.	Tani waa waqti kale.
You just have to do it.	Kaliya waa inaad sameyso.
I think it is very beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inuu aad u qurux badan yahay
Wherever you want.	Meel kasta oo aad rabto.
He said everything he could.	Waxa uu sheegay wax kasta oo uu awoodo.
But it was also something else.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay ahayd wax kale.
I knew what had happened	Waan ogaa waxa dhacay
I hope you would do well	Waxaan filayaa inaad ku fiicnaan lahayd
I will never do such a thing again.	Mar dambe ma samayn doono wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I know what is best for you	Waan ogahay waxa kuu fiican
I'm glad he does	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu sameeyo
I don't want that	Taas cidna uma rabo
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I thought she would already be here	Waxaan u maleeyay inay mar hore halkan joogi doonto
He could not come back.	Dib ayuu u soo noqon waayay.
I have nothing better to do	Ma hayo wax ka fiican oo aan sameeyo
I wanted to be part of this	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo kan
But everyone does.	Laakiin qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
I found you	Waan kula helay
It will not be too difficult.	Ma noqon doonto mid aad u adag.
I think we can leave you	Waxaan filayaa inaan kaa tagi karno
I have no idea what happened to him	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay
I will not tell him anything	Waxba u sheegi maayo
I go.	waan tagi.
You told us what to do.	Waxaad noo sheegtay waxaan sameeyo.
I have to do this for myself	Waa inaan tan ii sameeyaa
One of us has to go	Mid naga mid ah waa inuu tago
Not to be anyone.	Inaan cidna noqon.
I can't believe how much he is	Ma rumaysan karo inta uu yahay
No one can help me with this.	Qofna ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
I had to do more	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan sameeyo
It didn't matter to me.	Waxba igama lahayn.
They were told not to take it seriously.	Waxaa loo sheegay in aysan si dhab ah u qaadan.
It was a clear day.	Waxay ahayd maalin cad.
I did not leave	Maan bixi jirin
No one can do it	Qofna ma qaban karo
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
Otherwise I will not do it now.	Si kale hadda ma yeeli doono.
That is not what is happening here.	Taasi maaha waxa halkan ka socda.
You are the same as everyone else.	Waxaad la mid tahay dadka oo dhan.
I am sure she will succeed.	Waxaan hubaa inay guulaysan doonto.
I just know.	Kaliya waan ogahay.
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo inaan sameeyo.
I want him to learn.	Waxaan rabaa inuu barto.
I was ready to leave the past	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan ka tago wixii tagay
I will come back to find you	Waan u soo noqon doonaa si aan ku helo
I hope you would do something.	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax qaban lahayd.
Now he looked.	Hadda wuu eegay.
He did not like it here.	Ma uusan jeclayn halkan.
That could not be	Taas kuma noqon karin
He was not present.	Ma uu joogin.
It was an amazing day.	Waxay ahayd maalin yaab leh.
I'm afraid they are not	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaysan ahayn
He can do anything.	Wax kasta wuu samayn karaa.
I know him very well	Si dhib leh ayaan isaga garanayaa
I was just, you know	Waxaan ahaa kaliya, waad ogtahay
I would like to continue working with you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula sii shaqeeyo
I did not know about this	Maan ogayn arrintan
There was something in it.	Wax baa ku jiray.
I would love to have you there	Waxaan jeclahay inaan halkaas kugu haysto
I have never found such.	Weligay ma helin sida.
Probably the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ugu fiican tahay.
I think he wants to talk to you	Waxaan filayaa inuu rabo inuu kula hadlo
You would love to	Waad jeclaan lahayd
I have to love you more	Waa inaan ku jeclahay in ka badan
I knew how he felt.	Waan ogaa sida uu dareemayo.
He is really who we are.	Runtii waa qofka aan nahay.
I did not know.	Ma ogayn.
Obviously, it will take time.	Sida cad, waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
I did not want to tell you	Maan rabin inaan kuu sheego
Tell them we can do better.	U sheeg inaan sameyn karno si ka sii wanaagsan.
It is a great and beautiful place.	Waa meel weyn oo qurux badan.
I really heard what he had to say	Aad baan u maqlay waxa uu leeyahay
Someone was there.	Qof baa meesha joogay.
He said he only saw it once.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu mar kaliya arkay.
He no longer understood.	Wax dambe ma uu fahmin.
Not available	Lama heli karo
I wonder if you have	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aad leedahay
I saw what happened to you	Waxaan arkay waxa kugu dhacay
But she did more than that.	Laakiin waxay samaysay wax ka badan taas.
I want to help him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo isaga.
I have nothing better to do	Ma hayo wax ka fiican oo aan sameeyo
Not me.	Aniga igama aha.
I hope you can help me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad iga caawin karto
I don't want to talk to him.	Ma rabo inaan la hadlo.
I was surprised, maybe he would even like to do it	Waxaan la yaabay, malaha xitaa wuu jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo
We are real.	Waxaan nahay dhab.
There is little of everything.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo wax walba ah.
They just aren't there.	Kaliya ma jiraan.
But for the most part, he left.	Laakiin inta badan, wuu ka tagay.
I am not here	Anigu halkan kuma joogo
Too much time	Waqti aad u badan
How amazing is that? 	Sidee la yaab leh taasi?
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
But this is not over yet.	Laakiin tani weli ma dhammaan.
I can get it.	Waan heli karaa.
No one can do much about it.	Qofna wax badan kama qaban karo taas.
This is enough for me.	Waxaa igu filan tan.
Like at home.	Sida guriga oo kale.
They did not stop him.	Ma ay joojin isaga.
It could be another.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid kale.
I am very happy about that	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas
I like to talk to you	Waxaan jeclahay inaan kula hadlo
And I found nothing.	Oo waxba ma helin.
He was a really good man.	Runtii nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
That is now.	Taasi waa hadda.
She told him not to come back.	Waxay u sheegtay in aanu soo noqon.
She loves you.	Way ku jeceshahay.
I have some work for you	Waxaan kuu hayaa xoogaa shaqo ah
There is nothing to talk about.	Wax laga hadlo ma jiraan.
I can't believe how amazing you really are	Ma rumaysan karo sida aad dhab ahaantii u yaab badan tahay
He did not want to return	Ma rabin inuu soo noqdo
I think it could happen	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay dhici karto
That would be correct.	Taasi sax bay ahaan lahayd.
I still have a friend who came home to me	Weli waxaan lahaa saaxiib guriga igu soo noqday
I should have told him earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego wakhti hore
She did not want to do this.	Ma ay rabin inay tan samayso.
Like everything	Sida wax kasta
I really liked him	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga
I can't find it	ma heli karo
I did not do this	Maan samayn tan
I know it's not true	Waan ogahay inaysan run ahayn
It was so much more.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
We will stay here if you need anything.	Waan joogi doonaa halkan haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
I need to go to school	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan aado dugsiga
Not close	Uma dhawaan
I could not leave	Waan bixi waayay
It's just that.	Waa wax kaliya.
I need to know why you will not see me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta aadan ii arki doonin
It's a terrible thing.	Waa wax aad u xun.
But that was not the main reason.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn sababta ugu weyn.
I hope you like it.	Waxaan filayaa inaad jeclaan lahayd.
I gave everything	Wax walba waan siiyay
I want to see more	Waxaan rabaa in aan wax badan arko
I did not think so.	Uma malaynayn.
She did not go.	Ma aysan tagin.
I know what you did tonight.	Waan ogahay waxaad samaysay caawa.
I did, as I entered the room	Waan sameeyay, aniga oo qolka galay
He is still there.	Wali ma joogo.
I will tell you, but no one else.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa, laakiin qof kale ma jiro.
You will see again, if you wish.	Waxaad arki doontaa mar kale, haddii aad rabto.
I have not seen one person close by	Hal qof oo u dhow maan arag
how is it ?.	waa sidee?.
I will not speak today	Maanta hadli maayo
I hope you will be very busy tomorrow	Waxaan filayaa inaad aad mashquul u noqon doonto berrito
I heard what you have to say	Waxaan maqlay waxa aad leedahay
I really do not know what to do	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo
We will even cook for you if you want	Xitaa waan kuu karin doonaa haddii aad rabto
It's not just who she is.	Kaliya maaha cidda ay tahay.
I could not leave the door immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan albaabka uga bixi waayay
More.	Wax ka badan.
I can't believe what you did to me	Ma rumaysan karo waxa aad ii samaysay
I can't say that now	Taas hadda ma odhan karo
I know they exist.	Waan ogahay inay jiraan.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
It was very good.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
Now need	Hadda u baahan
She lost this one.	Way ku wayday kan.
Now I have decided.	Hadda waan go'aansaday.
I need your help	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad i caawiso
Now, how much they still need you.	Hadda, inta ay weli kuu baahan yihiin.
I need to be with you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula joogo
I want to go there as well	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado halkaas sidoo kale
This is probably not the case.	Tani malaha maaha.
I always wanted to know more	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ogaado
But also true.	Laakiin sidoo kale run.
I still want that.	Weli taas ayaan rabaa.
That he would leave me.	In uu iga tagi lahaa.
That's a little better.	Taasi wax yar oo fiican.
I still have it today.	Ilaa maanta waan hayaa.
What to do with it was a difficult problem.	Waxa lagu sameeyo waxay ahayd dhibaato adag.
I asked him how much he had.	Inta uu haysto ayaan waydiiyay.
I'm having a great time	Waxaan ku jiraa waqti aad u fiican
I felt a little out of everything	Wax yar ayaan ka dareemay wax walba
I can see everything clearly	Wax walba si cad ayaan u arki karaa
I just need a place to be	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay meel aan joogo
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
I have no idea that.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo taas.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
I really need someone like you	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay qof kula mid ah
And if you will pay more.	Iyo haddii aad wax badan bixin doonto.
It's not too hard.	Maaha caqli aad u adag.
Where.	Aaway.
There is so much to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo.
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
In fact, it is not a bad idea.	Dhab ahaantii, fikrad xun maaha.
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
Probably so.	Malaha waa sidaas oo kale.
That would be a great place to eat on a good day.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd meel fiican oo laga cuno maalin wanaagsan.
Everything else happened.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa dhacay.
They are.	Waxay ka mid yihiin.
Now we are one.	Hadda waxaan nahay hal.
You will do better	Wax fiican baad qaban doontaa
He did not want to be here.	Ma uusan rabin inuu halkaan joogo.
It was awful but very interesting	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun laakiin aad u xiiso badan
Otherwise.	Haddii kale.
I told him a few clear truths	Waxaan u sheegay dhowr run oo cad
I have a lot to learn.	Wax badan oo aan barto ayaan hayaa.
I think it probably	Waxaan filayaa inay u badan tahay
I told her to help herself	Waxaan u sheegay inay is caawiso
It will not be discussed again.	Mar dambe laga hadli maayo .
I did that	Taas waan sameeyay
Now he is another man.	Hadda waa nin kale.
This is difficult for me.	Tani waa igu adag tahay aniga.
I wonder if that is true	Waxaan la yaabanahay in taasi run tahay
That was a very bad time.	Taasi waxay u ahayd wakhti aad u xun.
I had to stay with him	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga la joogo
He may be less busy today.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu maanta mashquul yar yahay.
There is no way to do that.	Ma jirto si loo sameeyo taas.
And he was.	Oo wuxuu ahaa.
They both do beautiful things.	Labaduba waxay sameeyaan waxyaabo qurux badan.
Worst of all, really.	Tan ugu xun, dhab ahaantii.
I can tell you whatever it is	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa wax kasta oo ay tahay
otherwise let me know.	haddii kale ii soo sheeg.
I just said.	Kaliya waan sheegay.
I wonder.	Waxaan la yaabanahay.
I think he loves me.	Waxaan filayaa inuu i jecel yahay.
No one will come to help you.	Qofna kuma iman doono inuu ku caawiyo.
I know what he will do	Waan ogahay waxa uu samayn doono
He still holds me.	Weli wuu i hayaa.
I did not give anything.	Waxba ma siin.
But there is a time and a place.	Laakiin waxaa jira waqti iyo meel.
not you.	ma adiga.
Now he could not.	Hadda wuu awoodi waayay.
I will not talk to anyone else	Qof kale kula hadli maayo
Maybe she already had.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hore u lahayd.
I should not have.	Ma ahayn inaan haysto.
I wanted you to know that	Waxaan rabay inaad taas ogaato
A little beauty.	Qurux yar.
I didn't like it very much	Aad uma jeclayn
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
Not a bad place.	Meel xun maaha.
I refused	waan diiday
I know they are there	Waan ogahay inay halkaas ku jiraan
You will have more time.	Waxaad heli doontaa waqti badan.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Waan ka xumahay, laakiin waa.
I have not done a very good job of that	Maan qaban shaqo aad u wanaagsan taas
It is me.	Waa aniga.
It was very, very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u adag oo aad u adag.
I was surprised she was lucky	Waxaan la yaabay inay nasiib ahayd
I do not know	Ma garanayo
I can't stop this.	Ma joojin karaa tan.
For me, it was great.	Aniga ahaan, aad bay ii ahayd.
I am the one you want	waxaan ahay kan aad rabto
Done.	La sameeyay.
Now I am happy at school.	Hadda waxaan ku faraxsanahay dugsiga.
I did not succeed, really	Kuma aan guulaysan, run ahaantii
I left him	Waan ka tagay isaga
I want that	taas ayaan rabaa
But everything.	Laakiin wax walba.
I will not do that again	Taas mar kale ma yeeli doono
Without saying anything else I came out	Aniga oo aan wax kale ku odhan ayaan ka soo baxay
She is good at everything.	Way ku fiican tahay wax walba.
I did not know what to do	Wax aan u sameeyo maan garanayn
I want everything he said and more	Waxaan rabaa wax walba oo uu yidhi iyo wax ka badan
I really like that	Aad ayaan u jeclahay taas
It has never been the same	Weligay sidii hore oo kale ma noqon
There was no place.	Ma jirin meel.
I will think so	Waan u malayn doonaa
She didn't want this.	Ma ay rabin tan.
Not sure exactly	Ma hubo si sax ah
I don't want to do that.	Ma doonayo inaan taas sameeyo.
I am so sorry for him	Aad baan ugu xumahay isaga
I have never seen anything like it happen before	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah oo dhacay hadda ka hor
He may not really want to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan runtii rabin.
Everything had to be done.	Wax walba waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
It can take a long time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer.
You can help me.	Waad i caawin kartaa.
That is very difficult.	Taasi waa mid aad u adag.
That is not what it says.	Taasi maaha waxa ay leedahay.
I felt better than that	Waxaan dareemay wax ka fiican taas
Only one problem.	Hal dhibaato oo kaliya.
Here and now I say this	Halkan iyo hadda ayaan tan ku leeyahay
I told you everything	Wax walba waan kuu sheegay
I do not want to know	Ma rabo inaan ogaado
That is not the same.	Taasi isku mid maaha.
That was really a good thing.	Taasi runtii waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
I took that to leave	Waxa aan taas u qaatay in aan ka baxo
And no one was there for a long time.	Oo cidna ma jirin wakhti dheer oo dheer.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
I did not do everything	Anigu wax walba ma aan samayn
I don't know who she is.	Ma garanayo cidda ay tahay.
Someone found it and fell for it.	Qof baa helay oo ku dhacay.
Tried to find it.	Isku dayay inuu helo.
This is too good to be true, they will say.	Tani aad bay u wanaagsan tahay in run la sheego, waxay odhan doonaan.
And take this.	Oo tan qaado.
He thought he was the only one who got it.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inuu yahay ka kaliya ee helay.
I do not do that.	Taas ma sameeyo.
I lost a friend.	Waxaan waayay saaxiib.
She is older than I am now.	Hadda way iga weyn tahay.
I was very into it.	Aad baan u galay.
I told him to leave me	Waxaan u sheegay inuu iga tago
I want something else	wax kale ayaan rabaa
You do not want to.	Ma aadan rabin.
There is nothing more beautiful.	Ma jiraan wax ka qurux badan.
There are some things you can not say.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aadan sheegi karin.
And, you can.	Oo, waad samayn kartaa.
I was so bad	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u xun
I really enjoyed that	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay taas
You can get whatever you want.	Waxaad heli kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I just refused	Kaliya waan diiday
I have no idea what he is doing there	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa uu halkaas ka samaynayo
I told you it would be great	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay fiicnaan lahayd
I did not know what it would be like	Maan garanayn sida ay noqon doonto
Maybe it was too beautiful.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
I am nothing and everything.	Anigu waxba iyo wax walba ma ihi.
I really want to help him	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo isaga
I can't let you do this	Ma ogolaan karo inaad tan sameyso
He must want to see it again.	Waa inuu rabo inuusan mar dambe arag.
I just want you to be happy	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad faraxsan tahay
He wants us.	Wuu naga rabaa.
I had it a year ago.	Waxaan lahaa hal sano ka hor.
I was a very bad friend	Waxaan ahaa saaxiib aad u xun
I knew it wasn't	Waan ogaa in aanay ahayn
It felt right.	Waxa la dareemay sax.
I can't do this	Ma samayn karo tan
I have no idea what is going on	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa socda
I don't want him.	Ma rabo isaga.
This was also nothing new.	Tani sidoo kale ma ahayn wax cusub.
As before, he felt like it was true.	Sidii hore oo kale, wuxuu dareemay sidii inay run tahay.
This includes me.	Tan waxaa ku jira aniga.
I hope to see you again soon	Waxaan filayaa inaan mar kale ku arki doono dhawaan
I'm really scared of you.	Runtii waan kuu baqayaa.
He did not go.	Ma uu tagi jirin.
No one knows where to find me.	Qofna ma garanayo meel uu iga helo.
I don’t have to work with a tough guy	Ma aha inaan la shaqeeyo qof adag
He will leave you soon.	Wuu kaa tagi doona dhawaan.
But this was not the only reason he returned.	Laakiin tani kaliya ma ahayn sababta uu u soo noqday.
There was something	Wax baa jiray
He is a man I have been told	Waa nin la ii sheegay
I looked to see who she was	Waxaan eegay si aan u arko cidda ay tahay
Not discussed.	Lama wada hadlin.
I can not do it	Ma samayn karo
you have done well.	wax fiican baad samaysay.
I think a lot about that	Wax badan ayaan ka qabaa taas
She did not lie.	Been ma aysan sheegin.
It really is.	Dhab ahaantii waa.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
That is more likely.	Taasi way u badan tahay.
I felt beautiful and smart	Waxaan dareemay qurux iyo caqli
I think it would be	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan lahayd
We are friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
You can stay	Waad joogi kartaa
I could not leave the house	Waan ka bixi waayay guriga
I really wanted him.	Aad ayaan u rabay isaga.
I have never seen anything like it before	Hadda ka hor ma arag wax la mid ah
He thought he was great.	Wuxuu mooday inuu weyn yahay.
I hope he likes it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu jeclaan lahaa
Give a little more to the person you really are.	Wax yar ka sii qofka aad dhab ahaantii tahay.
Just hold me if that is what you want.	Kaliya i qabo haddii taasi ay tahay waxa aad rabto.
Nothing big yet.	Wax weyn ma jiro ilaa hadda.
I still have no idea.	Wali wax fikrad ah ma hayo.
I was here today.	maanta ayaan halkan joogay.
I know why I don't see much	Waan ogahay sababta aan wax badan u arag
But he knew what was going on.	Laakiin wuu ogaa waxa socda.
I am sorry for what happened	Waan ka xumahay wixii dhacay
Just give your best.	Kaliya sii sida ugu fiican.
I decided to tell her	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan u sheego
He knew exactly what he was feeling.	Waxa uu si sax ah u ogaa waxa uu dareemayo.
They will love it even better.	Way ka jeclaan doonaan si ka wanaagsan.
I say	waxaan leeyahay
I knew it was you.	Waan ogaa inay adiga tahay.
I thought there was more	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay jiraan wax ka badan
I need someone to go out and tell	Waxaan u baahanahay qof aan u baxo oo u sheego
I know a lot about this	Wax badan ayaan arrintan ka ogahay
Now, you have one well.	Hadda, si fiican ayaad mid leedahay.
It will happen one day.	Waxay dhici doontaa hal maalin.
I wanted to be with him	Waxaan rabay inaan la joogo
I should not have been surprised	Ma ahayn inaan la yaabanahay
I also heard something recently	Waxaan sidoo kale maqlay wax dhawaan
Although it was correct.	In kasta oo ay sax ahayd.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I really did not want to come out	Runtii ma rabin inaan soo baxo
I do not even understand why he has it.	Ma fahmin sababta uu xitaa u leeyahay.
You will need it.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa.
I don't mind that.	Anigu taas waxba igama qabo.
I will not do anything about it.	Waxba kama qaban doono arrintan.
No more problems.	Dhib dambe ma jiro.
That's what it is.	Waa waxa uu yahay.
I do what you do.	Waxaan sameeyaa waxaad sameyso.
I really wish you didn't say that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa runtii inaadan sidaas odhan
We are ready for that.	Taas diyaar ayaan u nahay.
I do not know where yet, that the time will come	Ma aan garanayn meel weli, in ay iman doonto waqti
I really can't do this right now	Runtii tan hadda ma qaban karo
I really want you	aad baan kuu rabaa
I do not want to know.	Ma rabo inaan ogaado.
I told him the truth	Run baan u sheegay
I can't find anything	Waxba ma heli karo
I can't say what I do	Ma sheegi karo waxa aan sameeyo
Maybe he thought it was you.	Malaha wuxuu mooday inuu adiga yahay.
I am very happy about this.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay tan.
Not much.	Ma badna.
I did not understand that	Taas maan fahmin
Take something if you want, you are told.	Wax qaado haddii aad rabto, ayaa lagu yidhi.
It is difficult to say.	Way adag tahay in la sheego.
I said that some time ago	Waxaan taas sheegay in muddo ah ka hor
Very, very well done.	Aad iyo aad u wanaagsan ayaa la sameeyay.
You can not see it with difficulty.	Si dhib ah uma arki kartid.
That sounds like him.	Taasi waxay u egtahay isaga.
Not everyone is like me.	Qof walba aniga oo kale maaha.
I took it for granted that it was nothing	Waxaan u qaatay in uu yahay mid aan waxba ahayn
I can't help it again	Mar kale kuma caawin karo
I think it is the same here.	Waxaan filayaa inay halkan la mid tahay.
Now I know.	Hadda waan garanayaa.
I think she will do well.	Waxaan aad u qabaa inay wax wanaagsan samayn doonto.
Another job.	Shaqo kale.
I have to do it again	Waa inaan mar kale sameeyo
Probably right.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sax tahay.
I do not want to stay home	Ma rabo in aan sii joogo guriga
I told her we could be friends and nothing else	Waxaan u sheegay inaan saaxiibo noqon karno oo aan wax kale noqon karin
No one sees that.	Qofna taas ma arko.
That being said.	Waxa la yidhi.
I wanted to see how you are	Waxaan rabay inaan arko sida aad tahay
I found someone else	Waxaan helay qof kale
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
But she did not speak.	Laakiin ma aysan hadlin.
I just wanted this to be done	Kaliya waxaan rabay in tan la sameeyo
I do not have time now	Waqti ma helin hadda
It’s all about nothing.	Waa wax walba oo waxba.
That he did.	In uu sameeyay.
I would like to talk to you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula hadlo
I thought it was what she wanted	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay waxa ay rabto
Friend, friend	Saaxiib, saaxiib
There is nothing wrong with that.	Wax aad u xun ma jiraan.
I just wonder if that is true	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay in taasi run tahay
I need to see you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko
I know everyone is ready	Waan ogahay in qof walba uu diyaar u yahay
Don't leave me.	Ha iga tagin.
And he needs to get it right away.	Oo wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu si degdeg ah u helo.
As I like to talk.	Sida aan jeclahay inaan hadlo.
I was somewhere else	Meel kale ayaan joogay
I make money every day.	Waxaan sameeyaa lacag maalin kasta.
This is for me, not a job.	Tani aniga, maaha shaqo.
But it can be done.	Laakiin waa la samayn karaa.
I can't say anything good about him	Wax fiican kama sheegi karo isaga
I knew what was coming before he said.	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda ka hor inta uusan odhan.
I think it looks so beautiful	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay u egtahay mid aad u qurux badan
Maybe you too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
A man there told me.	Nin meesha joogay ayaa ii sheegay.
You did really well.	Runtii wax fiican baad samaysay.
I did not want to see anyone	Ma rabin inaan cidna arko
More, more.	Wax badan, ka badan.
I like to lie	Waxaan jeclahay inaan been sheego
You can now go home	Hadda waad aadi kartaa guriga
I will tell the truth.	Run sheegi doonaa.
Known, but neither is it.	La yaqaan, laakiin sidoo kale maaha.
It is up to you to tell someone.	Adiga ayaa kugu leh inaad qof u sheegto.
I was him.	Waxaan ahaa isaga.
I thought it might be interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon karto mid xiiso leh.
He went there	Halkaas ayuu u baxay
He really didn’t do anything to make things happen.	Run ahaantii ma samayn wax si uu wax u sameeyo.
It can happen for a long time.	Waxay dhici kartaa muddo dheer.
I heard at the same time it does not work	Waxaan maqlay waqti isku mid ma shaqeeyo
I think she always has	Waxaan filayaa inay had iyo jeer leedahay
I can think well	Waxaan u malayn karaa si fiican
If you need to do that.	Haddii aad u baahan tahay inaad taas samayso.
This requires work.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay shaqo.
I would love to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
She looks happy.	Waxay u egtahay mid faraxsan.
It was an interesting place.	Waxay ahayd meel xiiso leh.
I just took it	Kaliya waan u qaatay
I have nothing against it	Waxba kama qabo
But she rejected him.	Laakiin way diiday isaga.
I tried to help people	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo dadka
I could no longer	Hadda ka dib ma awoodin
I did not want to do that	Ma aanan rabin inaan taas sameeyo
She is good at it	Way ku fiican tahay
Something strange happened.	Wax la yaab leh baa ka dhacay.
Good for me.	Fiican aniga.
I wanted to see	Waxaan rabay inaan arko
I have heard a lot about you	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay
Why are you good.	Maxaad u fiican tahay.
tell me what it looks like.	ii sheeg sida ay u egtahay.
That being said.	Waxa la yidhi.
I didn’t think you wanted that.	Uma malaynayn inaad taas rabto.
Of course not.	Runtii, ma aha.
I have to get a little more tomorrow	Waa inaan helo xoogaa ka badan berrito
And not in the same way.	Oo isku si maaha.
I really want to talk to you	Waxaan aad u rabaa inaan kula hadlo
I really enjoyed that	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay taas
It should not take long.	Waa inaysan qaadan waqti dheer.
I just can't leave	Kaliya kama tagi karo
I really can't say what it is	Run ahaantii ma odhan karo waxa ay tahay
Day, place, person.	Maalin, meel, qof.
you can't really be.	dhab ma noqon kartid.
I wanted to be with her tonight	Waxaan rabay inaan caawa la joogo
It is still small.	Weli wuu yar yahay.
It is difficult to know what to do.	Way adag tahay in la ogaado waxa la sameeyo.
I know what he can do.	Waan ogahay waxa uu samayn karo.
It was so still.	Waxay ahayd sidaas weli.
He has.	Wuu hayaa.
A little is so good.	In yar ayaa sidaas u wanaagsan.
I should have seen if you could have found me	Waxay ahayd inaan arko haddii aad i heli lahayd
As much as he loves me.	Inta uu i jecel yahay.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan u helay runtii
But that could be me.	Laakiin taasi waxay noqon kartaa aniga.
Not talked for a while	In muddo ah lama hadlin
I think that was why he said it	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd sababta uu u sheegay
I thought you were beautiful	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad qurux badan tahay
I will not allow that	Ma ogolaan doono taas
I always wanted to do that	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan taas sameeyo
It's the rest.	Waa inta kale.
I do not think so	Anigu taas kuma qabo
I have to.	Waa inaan.
Now you are like someone else.	Hadda waxaad la mid tahay qof kale.
tell me what you want.	ii sheeg sida aad rabto.
I came back to find it	Waxaan u soo noqday si aan u helo
I don’t have to know that.	Ma hayo si aan taas ku ogaado.
Everyone else has it.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa leh.
You will do it, you will do it.	Waad sameyn doontaa, waad sameyn doontaa.
I would like to go there one day	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas aado maalin
But no one knows.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo.
I still can't speak	Wali kama hadli karo
I didn't know that, really	Taas maan ogayn, runtii
It is nothing new, really.	Wax cusub maaha, run ahaantii.
You would have stopped me.	Waad i joojin lahayd.
It was a great opportunity.	Waxay ahayd fursad weyn.
You are not alone.	Adiga kaliya maaha.
Not for everyone.	Ma ahan qof walba.
There was no single idea.	Ma jirin fikrad kaliya.
I knew he was doing everything he could.	Waan ogaa inuu samaynayo wax kasta oo uu awoodo.
I have seen many things here	Waxaan halkan ku arkay waxyaabo badan
The same is true if there is too little food.	Si la mid ah waa run haddii ay jirto cunto aad u yar.
What is clearer than that.	Maxaa taas ka cad cad.
A little bit.	Wax yar oo yar.
He has tried this before, he told us.	Mar hore ayuu tan isku dayay, ayuu noo sheegay.
I think he has the right idea	Waxaan filayaa inuu leeyahay fikrad sax ah
He felt a little.	Wuxuu dareemay wax yar.
I can see what follows	Waan arki karaa waxa soo socda
I saw a bad person	Waxaan arkay qof xun
They are bad.	Way xun yihiin.
I had to find out what happened	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
I think it was probably me	Waxaan filayaa inay aniga ahayd malaha
I wondered why there were so many	Waxaan la yaabay sababta ay u badan yihiin
I haven't talked to him in a while.	In muddo ah ma aan wada hadlin.
I was there to see it	Waxaan u joogay si aan u arko
It would also be unnecessary.	Waxa kale oo ay noqon lahayd mid aan loo baahnayn.
I can't believe it	Ma rumaysan karo
I can't say exactly what it is.	Si sax ah uma sheegi karo waxa ay tahay.
I owed money to everyone	Qof walba lacag baan ku lahaa
I don't feel anything for him	Waxba kama dareemayo isaga
This he knew.	Tani wuu ogaa.
She told him a lot.	Wax badan bay u sheegtay.
I'm afraid he doesn't always tell the truth	Waxaan ka baqayaa inuusan mar walba run sheegin
It really is something.	Runtii waa wax.
I know what you think of me	Waan ogahay waxa aad aniga ila tahay
Good idea, first of all	Fikrad wanaagsan, marka hore
I could not believe it was you	Waxa aan rumaysan waayay in ay tahay adiga
I should never have left him	Ma ahayn inaan weligay uga tagin isaga
I know and love people	Waan ogahay oo waan jeclahay dadka
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
And that he is not alone.	Iyo inuusan keligiis ahayn.
It cannot be done.	Lama samayn karo.
I have a lot on you	Wax badan ayaan kaa qabaa
That's how it was done.	Sidaas ayaa loo sameeyay.
I do not like to do	Ma jecli inaan sameeyo
They love us.	Way na jecel yihiin.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
I had no intention of seeing you again	Wax niyad ah uma lahayn inaan mar kale ku arko
Here I saw him.	Halkan ayaan ku arkay isaga.
I wanted someone else to speak.	Waxaan rabay qof kale inuu hadlo.
Everything will do.	Wax kasta ayaa qaban doona.
It is always visible to me	Mar walba waa la ii muuqdaa
That is nowhere else.	Taasi meel kale ma jirto.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
But not now.	Laakiin hadda maaha.
I did not speak	Maan la hadlin
It didn't matter who she was, what she was.	Dhib ma lahayn cidda ay ahayd, waxa ay ahayd.
You can hardly see him.	Si dhib ah ayaad u arki kartaa isaga.
I may not do anything anymore	Laga yaabaa inaanan mar dambe waxba samayn
I can no longer stay here	Halkan in ka badan ma sii joogi karo
Too much money.	Lacag aad u badan.
Maybe I should do that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan taas sameeyo.
I really do not.	Dhab ahaantii ma sameeyo.
Something is better than nothing.	Wax baa ka fiican waxba.
But what has happened now is nothing.	Laakiin waxa hadda dhacay waxba maaha.
Not even a little	Xitaa wax yar ma aha
I will not lie to you	Been kuu sheegi maayo
I took this today.	Kan maanta ayaan qaatay.
I can't help it.	Ma caawin karo.
I knew he would come out	Waan ogaa inuu ka soo bixi doono
I can't do it now.	Ma samayn karo hadda.
I saw what was there.	Waxaan arkay waxa jira.
Nice to be with you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad nala joogto.
Maybe it's him too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa sidoo kale inuu yahay isaga.
I hope you will find it was you	Waxaan filayaa inaad heli doonto inay adiga ahayd
There is nothing wrong with that, really.	Ma jiraan wax aad u xun, runtii.
Great surprise for everyone.	La yaab weyn qof walba.
But very little.	Laakiin aad u yar.
I know it's hard	Waan ogahay inay adag tahay
I don't know what to do about it.	Ma garanayo waxa aan ka sameeyo.
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
There was not much to see.	Wax badan oo la arki jiray ma jirin.
I will definitely stay here again !.	Waa hubaal inaan halkan mar kale sii joogi doono!.
It could not have happened by chance.	Ma noqon karin wax iska yimid.
It just didn’t come from me.	Kaliya igama iman.
Anyone who has any idea.	Qof kasta oo wax fikrad ah ka helay.
It looks beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay mid qurux badan.
I have everything you will need	Waxaan hayaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan doonto
I did not do it	Maan samayn isaga
I should not have spoken so loudly	Ma ahayn inaan aad u hadlo
It is done every day.	Maalin walba waa la sameeyaa.
She is probably still there.	Waxay u badan tahay inay weli halkaas joogto.
I know that's why now	Waan ogahay taasi waa sababta hadda
I liked that.	Waan ka helay taas.
I just don't say anything to anyone	Kaliya qofna waxba u odhan maayo
I did not know it was so bad	Maan ogayn inay sidaas u xun tahay
I was surprised he found something	Waxaan la yaabay inuu wax helay
I wanted to know more about that.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan ka ogaado taas.
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu doonayo inuu ila hadlo.
I would stay again	Mar kale ayaan joogi lahaa
I wanted to	waan rabay
I need to know everything	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax walba ogaado
Can you do this for me?	Ma ii samayn kartaa tan.
Even what you say is not difficult to do.	Xitaa waxaad leedahay ma aha inay adag tahay in la sameeyo.
If you can't, I'll do it.	Haddii aadan awoodin, waan sameyn doonaa.
I think so.	Sidaas ayaan u maleynayaa.
But, but.	Laakiin, laakiin.
And nothing else.	Oo wax kale ma jiraan.
Everything will be.	Wax walba waxay ahaan doonaan.
I thought so	Waxaan u maleeyay sidaas
That was very difficult.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
I want him to get out of here.	Waxaan rabaa inuu halkaan ka baxo.
I think it will actually be very close.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay dhab ahaantii noqon doonto mid aad u dhow.
I knew it would take a long time	Waxaan ogaa inay qaadan doonto waqti dheer
One with.	Mid leh.
I have something else first	Wax kale ayaan hayaa marka hore
It can't hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli karto.
Run run run.	Run run run.
That he knows.	In uu garanayo.
I didn’t get a chance to do it	Maan helin fursad aan ku sameeyo
I thought.	Waxaan u maleeyay.
I do not believe	Maan rumaysan
That is just me.	Taasi waa aniga kaliya.
I just want to get out of there	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas ka baxo
I really need to go.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago.
But they found nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma ay helin.
But he may not stay long.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan waqti badan joogin.
I am not as small as they are.	Ma ihi mid aad u yar sida ay yihiin.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
He would never see him again.	Mar dambe ma uu arki doonin isaga.
It probably is good for it.	Waxay u badan tahay in ay u wanaagsan tahay.
I wanted him to do it	Waxaan rabay inuu sameeyo
I hope you can help me	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo inaad i caawin karto
They both live at home.	Labaduba waxay ku nool yihiin guriga.
It is so beautiful.	Waa mid aad u qurux badan.
I never knew who he was to this day	Weligay maan garanayn cidda uu yahay ilaa maanta
He knows what is best for him.	Wuu garanayaa waxa u wanaagsan.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
I hold on	Waan isku hayaa
Very difficult.	Si aad u dhib badan.
I would never do that at home	Weligay taas guriga kuma aan samayn lahayn
I love helping people	Waxaan jeclahay inaan caawiyo dadka
I never understood that	Weligay taas ma fahmin
He knew what he was doing to me.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu igu samaynayo.
But that is not what he wanted now.	Laakiin taasi hadda ma aha waxa uu rabay.
No one can leave until he returns.	Qofna ma tagi karo ilaa uu ka soo noqdo.
It must have been very close.	Waa inay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
I think that is for sure	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay hubaal
I thought it was you	Waxaan u maleeyay inay adiga tahay
I had a great time	Waxaan helay waqti aad u fiican
He may not come.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan iman.
And this.	Oo kan.
But that is work.	Laakiin taasi waa shaqo.
That is the same thing.	Taasi waa wax la mid ah.
I hope this is so good !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay sidaas oo kale u wanaagsan tahay!.
What you look like is correct.	Sida aad u egtahay waa sax.
All well done.	Dhammaan si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I did nothing	Waxba maan qaban
I have to know how he got it	Waa inaan ogaado sida uu ku helay
we will find you better	si fiican ayaan kuu heli doonaa
It was, too.	Waxay ahayd, sidoo kale.
That is how it is set	Sidaas ayaa loo dhigay
It doesn't look like anything is done today	Uma eka in aan maanta waxba la qaban
I should have been here	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaan joogo
I want to see myself	Waxaan rabaa inaan is arko
I just want you to help me find him	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad iga caawiso inaan helo isaga
I want to go home	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga
I should have seen it earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan hore u arko
I want something else	Wax kale ayaan rabaa
I want it all the time	Waxaan rabaa mar walba
It was very difficult	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan
She said it shouldn’t really be surprising.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay si dhab ah u noqon wax la yaab leh.
I heard it here.	Halkan ayaan ku maqlay.
That was really, really the best thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd runtii, runtii waxa ugu wanaagsan.
I did not know it could be	Maan ogayn inay noqon karto
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
I did not want to discuss this with him	Ma aanan rabin inaan arrintan kala hadlo isaga
He is a bad person	Waa qof xun
Here is another one.	Waa kan mid kale.
They will say something.	Wax bay odhan doonaan.
I think that is probably the best	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi u badan tahay tan ugu wanaagsan
I really looked at it	Si dhab ah ayaan u eegay
I have to know how it is	Waa inaan ogaado sida ay tahay
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
He would always fall for it.	Had iyo jeer wuu ku dhici lahaa.
I have no idea what happened to him	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay
There were several other people present.	Waxaa joogay dhowr qof oo kale.
I found you very interesting	Waxaan kuu arkay mid aad u xiiso badan
I have not been home for a while	In muddo ah guriga maan tagin
I had to leave the house immediately	Waxay ahayd inaan si degdeg ah guriga uga baxo
But something else must.	Laakiin wax kale waa in.
She did not know what it was, but she would do it.	Ma ay garanayn waxa uu yahay, laakiin way samayn lahayd.
That was not like him.	Taasi ma ahayn isaga oo kale.
This is amazing, as you say.	Tani waa mid aad u yaab leh, sida aad leedahay.
I like to do good things for people	Waxaan jeclahay in aan dadka u sameeyo waxyaabo fiican
As of now.	Sida hadda.
He can even talk to people.	Xitaa dadka wuu la hadli karaa.
I heard what happened today	Waxaan maqlay waxa dhacay maanta
I bought it.	Waan iibsaday.
I did not believe it was	Maan rumaysan inay ahayd
But a lot is the same.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa la mid ah.
I need you to know that it is not a lie	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ogaato inaysan been ahayn
I still can't believe how beautiful it is	Wali ma rumaysan karo sida ay u qurux badan tahay
I wonder if anyone is there	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii qof uu halkaas joogo
I can't believe you did that, for me	Ma rumaysan karo inaad taas samaysay, aniga ahaan
I think that would be great	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd
That's what everyone did.	Taasi waa waxa qof walba sameeyay.
I did not want to leave again	Ma rabin inaan mar dambe ka tago
From now on.	Hadda ka dib.
But no one did.	Laakiin qofna ma samayn.
And not only now.	Oo hadda ma aha oo kaliya.
I still can't believe that	Weli taas ma rumaysan karo
I just love that more than you	Kaliya taas adiga ayaan kaa jeclahay
No one understood.	Qofna kuma fahmin.
It was not very interesting.	Ma ahayn mid aad u xiiso badan.
It may be done to see why.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in loo sameeyo si uu u arko sababta.
But there is also here.	Laakiin waxaa jira sidoo kale halkan.
But how was it.	Laakiin sidee buu ahaa.
I thought it would come back	Waxaan u maleeyay inay soo noqon doonto
I will give it to you well	si fiican ayaan ku siin doonaa
They like it when he does.	Waxay jecel yihiin marka uu sidaas sameeyo.
This is not correct.	Tani sax uma eka.
What is needed.	Waxa loo baahan yahay.
I could not clearly see what it was.	Si cad uma arki karin waxa ay tahay.
Of course, this is not new.	Runtii, tani maaha mid cusub.
I did not succeed in that	Kuma aan guulaysan taas
We will do whatever you want.	Waxaan samayn doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
You can see why.	Waad arki kartaa sababta.
He didn’t like it, it wasn’t at first.	Ma uu jeclayn, marka hore ma ahayn.
It is the best.	Waa kan ugu fiican.
I was very impressed today	Aad ayaan maanta ula dhacay
Just a lot of things like that.	Kaliya waxyaabo badan oo sidaas oo kale ah.
Now, maybe.	Hadda, malaha.
I knew it really was	Waan ogaa inay run ahaantii ahayd
That is the common denominator.	Taasi waa meesha la wada leeyahay.
I want to know how good it works	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida wanaagsan ee uu u shaqeeyo
I will tell him.	Waxaan u sheegi doonaa isaga.
I could not say anything	Waxba maan sheegi karin
I really wish he was there	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkaas joogo
You can.	Waad dhici kartaa.
I need something better.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax ka fiican.
That surprises me.	Taasi waa iga yaab.
I'm sure that will not happen	Waxaan hubaa in taasi aysan dhici doonin
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
Like a man who doesn't love you anymore.	Sida nin aan dib kuu jeclayn.
I might even get a new car	Xitaa waxaa laga yaabaa inaan helo baabuur cusub
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
But he really felt something else.	Laakiin waxa uu runtii dareemay wax kale.
And I found nothing.	Oo waxba ma helin.
I was really impressed	Runtii aad baan ula dhacay
And so did everyone else in the room.	Oo sidaas oo kale dhammaan dadka kale ee qolka.
I never really saw him again	Runtii mar dambe maan arag isaga
Maybe I even have something for you	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa wax kuu haysto
I know you would like to be there	Waan ogahay inaad jeclaan lahayd inaad halkaas joogi lahayd
I will no longer be smart	Anigu caqli dambe ma ahaan doono
It is one.	Waa mid.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
This is done.	Tani waa la sameeyay.
Do nothing.	Waxba ha ku samayn.
I should not be able to really say that	Waa inaanan awoodin inaan si dhab ah u sheego taas
But a lot harder.	Laakiin wax badan oo adag.
I want to be there to help	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas joogo si aan u caawiyo
Nothing was seen.	Wax la arkay ma jirin.
I really wanted to do that	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan taas sameeyo
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
I hear something almost every day	Waxaan maqlay wax ku dhow maalin kasta
And there is plenty of time.	Oo waxaa jira waqti badan.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
Always.	Had iyo jeer.
But you are right.	Laakiin run baad tahay.
I need to go now.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda tago.
I didn't think it would happen anytime soon	Uma malaynayn inay si degdeg ah u dhici doonto
There is nothing else to say.	Wax kale oo la sheego ma jiraan.
I really do not.	Runtii ma sameeyo.
I don't even think so.	Xitaa uma maleynayo.
I really don't know how to do it.	Runtii ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo.
I told you and I told you.	Waan kuu sheegay oo kuu sheegay.
There is not enough time for her to do it.	Ma jiro wakhti ku filan oo ay ku samayn karto.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii way qurux badan tahay.
I'm surprised you like me	Waxaan la yaabay inaad i jeceshahay
I told him it was nothing	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay waxba ahayn
He makes sure nothing comes out of the door.	Wuu hubaa in aanay albaabka waxba ka soo bixin.
would like.	jeclaan lahaa.
Maybe.	Malaha .
I still can't stop.	Wali ma joojin karo.
I looked for a long time	Waxaan eegay muddo dheer
I just want something done.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in wax la sameeyo.
And so on.	Iyo sidaas.
Maybe not me, but you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan aniga ahaan, laakiin adiga.
I have never seen him like that	Maan arag isaga oo kale
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
I love you in the same way	Waxaan ku jeclahay si la mid ah
But something.	Laakiin wax .
I could not do that at home	Taas guriga kuma aanan samayn karin
I can help you with everything, but not everything	Wax walba waan kaa caawin karaa, laakiin wax walba maaha
I couldn’t even think of doing that.	Xitaa ma u malayn karin inaan taas sameeyo.
There is no one like me.	Qof ila mid ah ma jiro.
I will not do it again	Mar kale ma yeeli doono
I would not believe it.	Ma rumaysan lahaa.
He will do so today.	Maanta ayuu sidaas yeeli doonaa.
For more than a few years.	Muddo dhowr sano ka badan.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
Everyone heard.	Qof kastaa wuu maqlay.
I didn't even understand anything	Xitaa waxba maan fahmin
I just want the best	Waxaan rabaa kaliya kan ugu fiican
I wanted friends	Waxaan rabay saaxiibo
Hold on a little.	Qabo wax yar.
I knew it was a good idea	Waan ogaa inay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan
I did not even know it existed	Xitaa maan ogayn inay jirto
You can see it right there	Waxaad arki kartaa isla halkaas
They are in trouble.	Dhib bay ku jiraan.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
I can just be all happy	Kaliya waxaan noqon karaa mid faraxsan oo dhan
Everyone is good to others.	Qof kastaa wuu u fiican yahay dadka kale.
I am afraid of what will happen	Waxaan ka baqayaa waxa dhici doona
This is probably the best.	Tani waxay u badan tahay tan ugu wanaagsan.
He is there.	Meesha ayuu joogaa.
I can't do it now	Ma awoodo hadda
Everyone should have it !.	Qof walba waa inuu leeyahay!.
I knew that was what he wanted	Waan ogaa in taasi ay tahay waxa uu doonayo
Designed to work.	Loo sameeyay in lagu shaqeeyo.
They do not have to do this yet.	Ma aha inay sidaas sameeyaan weli.
I am not one.	Mid ma ihi.
No one could say.	Qofna ma odhan karin.
I would like to say.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sheego.
I do not have time to do that again	Waqti uma hayo inaan taas mar kale sameeyo
That was so.	Taasi waxay ahayd sidaas.
I have to do less	Waa inaan wax ka yar sameeyaa
I could not find anything better.	Wax ka fiican maan helin.
I know why he does it for me	Waan ogahay sababta uu ii samaynayo
And he had no idea where to find it.	Oo ma uu haysan wax fikrad ah meel uu ka helo.
I can clearly see.	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa.
I think she is with me	Waxa aan filayaa in ay aniga ila tahay
I can spend a lot of money on this.	Waxaan ku bixin karaa lacag badan tan.
Even if it is good.	Xitaa haddii ay wanaagsan tahay.
He would leave home.	Wuxuu ka tagi lahaa guriga.
I think that is a lot	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi badan yihiin
She was an adult.	Waxay ahayd qof weyn.
This is you.	Tani waa adiga.
I didn't think it would come out	Uma malaynayn inay soo bixi doonto
I wondered what had happened	Waxaan la yaabay waxa dhacay
I'm just at home	Kaliya guriga ayaan la joogaa
I wonder how everyone will be	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida qof walba u noqon doono
I had to tell someone	Waxay ahayd inaan qof u sheego
That will never happen again.	Taasi mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
Maybe I thought so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u maleeyay.
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
You will tell me everything bad.	Waxaad ii sheegi doontaa wax kasta oo xun.
Now it wasn't the same, he knew.	Hadda isku mid ma ahayn, wuu ogaa.
That was a problem for us.	Taas oo dhib nagu ahayd.
I need to work with you on that	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan taas kula shaqeeyo
I didn't want anything to do with me.	Maan rabin in wax la iga rabo.
Maybe if you have like three cars.	Malaha haddii aad leedahay sida saddex baabuur.
It is what they do.	Waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
I really wanted to leave	Aad ayaan u rabay inaan baxo
But she could not.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday.
That is a lie.	Taasi waa been.
Stop everything you are doing.	Jooji wax kasta oo aad samaynayso.
He seemed real.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid dhab ah.
I think she loves you.	Waxaan filayaa inay ku jeceshahay.
I can do more if you want	Wax badan ayaan samayn karaa haddii aad rabto
I just want to know who she was	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda ay ahayd
Perhaps this is the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay tahay tan ugu fiican.
No one would stop.	Qofna ma joojin lahaa.
I would not have otherwise.	Si kale uma haysan lahaa.
That is not just here.	Taasi halkan kaliya maaha.
A few of them were launched.	Wax yar oo ka mid ah ayaa la bilaabay.
She told me.	Waxay igu tidhi.
You said no.	Waxaad tidhi ma aha.
I knew you, but	Waan ogaa adiga, laakiin
Much better.	Wax badan ayaa ka fiican.
I really don't know anyone.	Runtii qofna ma garanayo.
Probably the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd tan ugu fiican.
I have to know where she is	Waa inaan ogaado halka ay joogto
I will do this again.	Mar kale ayaan tan samayn doonaa.
But she could not.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday.
You can still stay.	Weli waad joogi kartaa.
But we cannot stay here.	Laakiin halkan kuma sii joogi karno.
I have never seen him.	Weligay ma arag isaga.
No wonder people who know me.	La yaab ma leh dadka i yaqaan.
I will not come here again	Mar dambe halkan ma iman doono
I say they are bad for me	Waxaan leeyahay way ii xun yihiin
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
Surprisingly, he thought.	Yaab in, wuxuu u maleeyay.
I do this at home for nothing	Waxaan taas ku sameeyaa guriga waxba
I'm glad you like it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad jeceshahay.
I did not think it would be so.	Uma malaynayn inay sidaas noqon doonto.
I thought it was so beautiful	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u qurux badan tahay
No one was there.	Ma jirin qof halkaas joogay.
I did not want to know	Maan rabin inaan ogaado
He wanted to know if he could help.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado inuu caawin karo iyo in kale.
He is not ready	Diyaar ma ahan
I wanted to learn better.	Waxaan rabay inaan si fiican u barto.
I hope for the best.	Waxaan rajeynayaa wax wanaagsan.
I hope this is good for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay kugu fiican tahay.
I just wanted to see what he did	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan arko wuxuu sameeyay
I still haven't found it.	Wali maan helin.
Everyone must have been at work.	Qof kastaa waa inuu ku jiray shaqada.
There is no way to find out.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado.
Not you, please.	Adiga ma aha, fadlan.
For me.	Aniga ahaan.
That will be done again.	Taas ayaa mar kale la samayn doonaa.
I know you all the time.	Waa ku garanayaa mar walba.
But it is difficult.	Laakiin way adag tahay.
He pretended to be back in prison.	Waxa uu iska dhigay in uu xabsiga ku soo noqday.
A little came back.	In yar baa soo noqday.
It was not right.	Wax sax ah ma ahayn.
He tried three times.	Saddex jeer ayuu isku dayay.
Only day and time.	Kaliya maalin iyo waqti.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
I was still in prison	Weli xabsiga ayaan ku jiray
I thought we could talk a little.	Waxaan mooday inaan wax yar wada hadli karno.
I should have told you before	Waxay ahayd inaan hadda ka hor kuu sheego
I did not want to be there at first	Ma aanan rabin in aan halkaas joogo markii hore
He was a great man.	Nin weyn buu ahaa.
I really am not.	Dhab ahaantii ma ihi.
Tell them.	U sheeg.
If you love someone you love, you can't help it.	Haddii aad jeceshahay qof aad jeceshahay, ma caawin kartid.
I still haven't found it	Wali dib uma helin
I knew it was coming soon	Waan ogaa inay maalin dhow noqon doonto
Who is it.	Waa kuma.
But it will.	Laakiin way yeeli doontaa.
It really isn’t as hard as it sounds.	Runtii ma aha mid adag sida ay u egtahay.
But that is no longer the case.	Laakiin taasi mar dambe maaha.
Tell her how she likes it.	U sheeg sida ay u jeceshahay.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha.
He was not.	Ma uusan ahayn.
Not sure what is going on here.	Ma hubo waxa halkan ka socda.
I want a car	waxaan rabaa baabuur
She had to do what she was told.	Waxay ahayd inay samayso wixii lagu yidhi.
I haven't seen a car come in, either.	Ma aanan arag baabuur meesha soo galay, sidoo kale.
Pick it up.	Soo qaado.
I know you are like that	Waan ogahay inaad sidaas oo kale tahay
And more than three times.	Iyo in ka badan saddex jeer.
But it is him.	Laakiin waa isaga.
I want to be happy	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku faraxsanahay
I told her it was urgent	Waxaan u sheegay inay degdeg tahay
We cannot win.	Ma guulaysan karno.
This, he said.	Tani, ayuu yidhi.
I thought I would have more time	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan waqti badan heli doono
You will need to do something else.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad sameyso wax kale.
I should have seen it	Waxay ahayd inaan arko
Very little time	Waqti aad u yar
It may be nothing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan waxba ahayn.
I thought that was just that	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi tahay oo kaliya
I can't, really.	Ma awoodo, runtii.
I have to go	waa inaan tago
It has been known for some time.	Waa la yaqaan in muddo ah.
I do that all the time	Taas ayaan sameeyaa mar kasta
Nor do they.	Sidoo kale ma sameeyaan.
Yours is here.	Adiga ayaa iska leh halkan.
There is no other way.	Si kale oo loo sheego ma jirto.
I will do it here	Waxaan ku samayn doonaa halkan
I can see it now	Anigu hadda waan arki karaa
He wanted what he wanted.	Waxa uu rabay ayuu rabay.
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax weyn.
Maybe I want to	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan rabo
I wanted to stay home	Waxaan rabay inaan guriga joogo
I could not see anything	Waxba maan arki karin
I'm sure I will be good friends	Waxaan hubaa inaan noqon doono saaxiibo wanaagsan
Something terrible that could not be said.	Wax aad u xun oo aan la sheegi karin.
This is clearly true.	Tani waa run si cad.
There was something else, something very strange.	Waxaa jiray wax kale, wax aad u yaab leh.
I really took this seriously	Runtii tan waxaan u qaatay si dhab ah
I can not tell you what	Ma kuu sheegi karo waxa
That is a huge problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato aad u weyn.
But nothing helped.	Laakiin waxba ma caawin.
I did not do much	Wax badan maan qaban
Great job, again.	Shaqo weyn, mar kale.
You can't like him.	Ma jeclaan kartid isaga.
He then disappeared.	Ka dib waa la waayay.
That may not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon karto.
I should have known better that I would do that	Waxay ahayd inaan si ka sii wanaagsan u ogaado inaan taas samayn lahaa
I only had one, and I really wanted another	Mid kaliya ayaan lahaa, oo runtii mid kale ayaan rabay
He took it.	Wuu ka qaaday.
It is difficult to say what is needed and what is not.	Way adag tahay in la sheego waxa loo baahan yahay iyo waxa aan ahayn.
It had nothing to do with that	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn taas
He thought he was surprised.	Yaab buu mooday.
This was a good thing for me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd wax wanaagsan.
It is clear that.	Waxaa cad in.
I tried to leave.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan baxo.
I never thought so	Weligay uma malaynayn sidaas
Not very good	Aad uma fiican
They are not together.	Ma wada jiraan.
I really know what you are saying	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa waxaad leedahay
That is.	Taasi waa.
What will you do? 	Maxaad samayn doontaa?
He knew it would happen.	Wuu ogaa inay dhici doonto.
It may still exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli jirto.
I really did not want to	Runtii ma rabin
This is not what should be done.	Tani ma aha waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo.
To do.	In la sameeyo.
I really didn't want to talk to people	Runtii ma rabin inaan dadka la hadlo
I know he is near school today	Waan ogahay in uu maanta meel u dhow dugsiga
It was obvious indeed.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad runtii.
But today it is even better.	Laakiin maanta waa ka sii fiican.
I would love that.	Waan jeclaan lahaa taas.
You should still be there.	Waxay ahayd inaad weli joogto.
But they will not be able to do it.	Laakiin ma awoodi doonaan inay sameeyaan.
He will tell you it will take time.	Wuxuu kuu sheegi doonaa inay qaadan doonto waqti.
I wonder who left there	Waxaan la yaabanahay yaa halkaas uga tagay
Not everyone knew.	Qof kastaa ma ogayn.
Everyone knew.	Qof walba wuu ogaa.
I do not want to talk about it again	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo mar dambe
She would do it.	Way samayn lahayd.
It was always found and he came back quickly	Mar walba waa la helay oo si degdeg ah ayuu u soo noqday
He knew she would be there.	Wuu ogaa inay halkaas joogi doonto.
I have not done it yet	Wali ma samayn
I did	waan sameeyay
I don't see how this can be done.	Ma arko sida tan loo sameeyo.
I can help with that	Waan ku caawin karaa taas
I don't want to see him again	Mar dambe ma rabo inaan arko
One day you will need the same.	Maalin waxaad u baahan doontaa sidaas oo kale.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ma garanayo waxa ku dhici jiray.
There was no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jirin.
She will talk.	Way hadli doontaa.
There was nothing she could do about it.	Ma jirin wax ay ka qaban karto.
He gave me a chance tonight.	Caawa fursad ayuu i siiyay.
Here, too, he did not know what was to come.	Halkan, sidoo kale, ma uu garanayn waxa soo socda.
He found it very interesting.	Waxa uu u arkay mid aad u xiiso badan.
I still do not understand that	Weli taas ma fahmin
I do not understand exactly why	Si sax ah uma fahmin sababta
I know what will happen	Waan ogahay waxa dhici doona
I left it all	Waxaan ka tagay dhammaan
I will not come home today	Maanta guriga iman maayo
That would be bad.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd mid xun.
I am also happy to work there	Waxaan sidoo kale ku faraxsanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo halkaas
I do not eat.	Ma cuno.
I can't give her everything she wants	Wax walba oo ay rabto ma siin karo
You can go back to work.	Waxaad dib ugu noqon kartaa shaqada.
I don’t know what to do with him really.	Ma garanayo waxa uu ka sameeyo isaga runtii.
I was supposed to be.	Waxaa la ii rabay in aan noqdo.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan.
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
As you will not believe.	Sida aadan rumaysan doonin.
I think you will like it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto
She would do anything.	Wax walba way samayn lahayd.
I will not lie	Been sheegi maayo
It was up to me to find out	Waxay ila ahayd inaan ogaado
I just did not give	Kaliya maan siin
I'm surprised you	yaab baan kuu hayaa
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
He knew.	Wuu ogaa.
I knew that was for me	Waan ogaa inay taasi aniga ii ahayd
Immediately he disappeared.	Isla markii uu waayay.
This is not a bad thing.	Tani wax xun maaha.
I should not have done that	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas ku sameeyo
Certainly there is.	Hubaal inuu jiro.
I need to know where you are at all times	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado meesha aad joogto mar walba
I am ready	diyaar ayaan ahay
Not discussed.	Lama wada hadlin.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
What is it.	Waa maxay.
I can just go and do it.	Kaliya waan tagi karaa oo waan samayn karaa.
I like to be told	Waxaan jeclahay in la ii sheego
Obviously he could never do that	Sida iska cad inuu taas waligiis samayn karin
Everyone else was somewhere else.	Qof kasta oo kale wuxuu ahaa meel kale.
I could not do anything else	Wax kale maan qaban karin
Very difficult most of the time.	Aad u adag inta badan.
I can't find that.	Taas ma heli karo.
He could not see much.	Wax badan ma uu arki karin.
That is a fact.	Waa dhab taas.
I will do it.	waan yeeli doonaa.
He liked the job.	Shaqada wuu ka helay.
I tried to see	Waxaan isku dayay in la arko
That was given.	Taasi waa la siiyay.
It must be helped.	Waa in la caawiyo.
I wanted to get back here.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkan ku soo noqdo.
It had nothing to do with that.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn taas.
I have to say every meal, really	Waa inaan sheego cunto kasta, run ahaantii
I think that's right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay
Something is still coming.	Wax wali soo socda.
No one was there.	Qofna halkaas ma joogin.
I didn't want any money.	Maan rabin lacag.
But it is not over yet.	Laakiin weli ma dhammaan.
No one has seen anything like it.	Qofna ma arag wax la mid ah.
Maybe he didn't like it.	Malaha wuu jeclaan waayay.
I always know a lot about you	Had iyo jeer wax badan ayaan kaa ogahay
I can't just go out and buy something	Ma bixi karo oo kaliya inaan wax ka iibsado
I had a boyfriend who was a man	Waxaan lahaa saaxiib nin ahaa
It was lucky.	Waxay ahayd nasiib.
I didn't have time.	Waqti ma haysan.
I just do	Kaliya waan sameeyaa
I think it's a good thing.	Aniga waxay ila tahay wax wanaagsan.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
She missed him, this.	Way isku wayday isaga, tan.
He said he was busy and could not get out.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu mashquul yahay oo uusan soo bixi karin.
Please give me a chance to work.	Fadlan i sii fursad aan ku shaqeeyo.
It was as he said.	Waxay ahayd sidii uu yidhi.
I think that will happen	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhici doonto
He asked for help.	Waxa uu codsaday in la caawiyo.
He seemed to want to help.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu doonayo inuu caawiyo.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I will not lie to anyone	Qofna been u sheegi maayo
He wanted nothing.	Waxba wuu rabay.
I know he loves me very much	Waan ogahay inuu aad ii jecel yahay
I will say this again	Mar kale ayaan tan odhan doonaa
Still not sure what to do.	Wali ma hubo waxaan sameeyo.
I will pay back	dib ayaan bixin doonaa
I was not given a chance	Fursad ma siin
I’ve been here a lot.	In badan ayaan halkan soo galay.
I know that's bad.	Waan ogahay in taasi ay xun tahay.
It's something else.	Waa wax kale.
I did not like it.	Maan jeclayn.
I would like to know more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ogaado.
Not a day.	Ma aha maalin.
I wanted to tell him everything, but I didn't	Waxaan rabay inaan u sheego wax walba, laakiin ma aanan sheegin
I know you can help me	Waan ogahay inaad i caawin karto
I was not like that.	Anigu sidaas ma ahayn.
It was not long ago.	Waqti ka hor ma ahayn.
I thought you might be.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad noqon karto.
Not much to do, really.	Wax badan ma aha in la sameeyo, runtii.
I had to get out of there.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas ka baxo.
He wants something else.	Wax kale ayuu rabaa.
See you tomorrow	Berri ayaan ku arki doonaa
We need to keep working.	Waxaan u baahanahay in la sii shaqeeyo.
I would really like to know you.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku ogaado.
But he said nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma uu odhan.
He knew very well.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
I have not seen it yet	Wali ma arag
I looked and I really saw	Waan eegay oo runtii waan arkay
I can't do this	Ma samayn karo tan
I know where he is	Waan ogahay meesha uu joogo
I just didn’t see it	Kaliya ma arag
This is really nothing new.	Tani runtii wax cusub maaha.
said nothing.	waxba ma odhan.
You can leave now	Hadda waad bixi kartaa
They did not have it.	Ma ay haysan.
I did not see anything	Waxba maan arag
I liked everyone	Dadka oo dhan waan ka helay
I did it several times	Waxaan sameeyay dhowr jeer
Something here was still in trouble.	Wax halkan weli dhibaato u diyaar ahaa.
I thought how would you like to know.	Waxaan u maleeyay sida aad jeclaan lahayd inaad ogaato.
He just didn’t get it.	Kaliya kuma uu helin.
He was a very tough guy	Nin aad u adag buu ahaa
You can take it.	Waad qaadan kartaa.
I want to know how she did it and why	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sida ay u samaysay iyo sababta
I know how he feels	Waan ogahay sida uu dareemayo
Everyone seemed to know something about it.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqday inuu wax ka ogaa.
I don't know if you can do that or not.	Ma garanayo inaad taas samayn karto iyo in kale.
I hope to work for you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan kuu shaqeeyo
I know that is not for you	Waan ogahay in taasi aysan adiga kugu ahayn
He said I want to talk to you.	Wuxuu yidhi waxaan rabaa inuu kula hadlo.
And now you would not be here.	Oo hadda ma aad joogi lahayd halkan.
He never did.	Waligiis ma uu samayn.
I have not done anything wrong yet.	Weli wax xun ma samayn.
I want to talk about something else	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax kale ka hadlo
I just hope he doesn't know where we live	Kaliya waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan garanayn meesha aan ku nool nahay
I want to see how they will be, now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko sida ay ahaan doonaan, hadda.
I will get more	Wax badan ayaan heli doonaa
What's next, who knows.	Maxaa soo socda, yaa yaqaan.
It was close.	Waxay ahayd dhow.
I did not stay long	Ma aanan joogin wakhti dheer
I did that.	taas ayaan sameeyay.
I know very well who she was	Aad ayaan u garanayaa cidda ay ahayd
It really is you.	Runtii waa adiga.
It does not work.	Ma shaqeeyo.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I want to do it	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo
Something beautiful.	Wax qurux badan.
Maybe this was the reason.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay ahayd sababta.
I want to be there when you do.	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas joogo marka aad sameyso.
I had to talk to her	Waxay ahayd inaan la hadlo
He took something else.	Wax kale ayuu qaatay.
I need to work here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo halkan
There was, of course, nowhere else to go.	Ma jirin, runtii, meel kale oo la aado.
I need help	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan caawiyo
I need to learn to see it that way	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan barto inaan sidaas ku arko
He is a man with many friends.	Waa nin saaxiibo badan leh.
Maybe I should.	Malaha waa in aan.
With a friend.	La saaxiib.
I will do it soon.	Waan samayn doonaa dhawaan.
It just can’t be.	Kaliya ma noqon karto.
I think that is not the case	Waxaan filayaa in taasi aanay ahayn sidaas
He must do so.	Waa inuu sidaas sameeyaa.
I knew something bad was going to happen	Waan ogaa inay wax xun dhici doonaan
It will be done.	Waa la samayn doonaa.
I think he knew that	Waxaan filayaa inuu taas ogaa
I will never do that.	Weligay taas ma yeeli doono.
Do not give it to him.	Ha siin isaga.
He knew he didn't have to.	Wuu ogaa inuusan lahayn.
I need to know more about people	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan ka ogaado dadka
I had to see you again	Waxay ahayd inaan mar kale ku arko
I wanted you to know.	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
It was really, really good.	Waxay ahayd runtii, runtii aad u fiican.
Just me.	Aniga kaliya.
But then he left.	Laakiin ka dib wuu baxay.
I would do the same	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax la mid ah
I hope they do not see one coming	Waxa aan filayaa in aanay arag mid soo socda
After all, nothing is certain.	Ka dib oo dhan, waxba lama hubo.
.	.
I'm not sure if this is true.	Ma hubo inay tani sax tahay.
I think he should know	Waxay ila tahay inuu ogaado
I had the opportunity to get to know him	Waxaan fursad u helay inaan barto isaga
I thought it was very good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u fiican tahay
There is a lot of work.	Waxaa jira shaqo badan.
He does what he says he will do.	Wuu sameeyaa wuxuu yidhi waan samayn doonaa.
Don't spend more time than is necessary.	Ha ku bixin wakhti ka badan inta laga rabo.
I wanted to see him, today	Waxaan rabay inaan arko isaga, maanta
I had things to do	Waxaan lahaa waxyaabo aan sameeyo
I was over all	Waxaan ahaa in ka badan oo dhan
He is fine.	Wuu fiican yahay.
Now I walk out the door	Hadda waan ka baxay albaabka
No one can do that.	Qofna taas ma samayn karo.
I am very happy to be here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo
I tried to find out more about it yesterday	Waxaan isku dayay inaan wax badan ka ogaado shalay
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
They love me.	Way i jecel yihiin.
I won't believe it for a while	Ma rumaysan doono in muddo ah
He thought it was not true.	Waxa uu mooday in aanay run ahayn.
There is nothing else very good.	Wax kale oo aad u wanaagsan ma jiro.
He did not lie.	Been uma uu sheegin.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
We really can't stay long tonight.	Runtii ma joogi karno wakhti dheer caawa.
But it is beautiful.	Laakiin way qurux badan tahay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I can't say anything	Waxba kama hadli karo
I just couldn't believe it	Kaliya waan rumaysan waayay
Once again I was really busy.	Mar kale ayaan runtii mashquul ku noqday.
People must first be held accountable.	Marka hore waa in dadka la isku hayo.
I was very surprised by that.	Aad baan ula yaabay taas.
I started doing it again	Waxaan bilaabay inaan mar kale sameeyo
I am ready when you are	diyaar ayaan ahay marka aad tahay
That's what he told me.	Sidaas ayuu igu yidhi.
I just can't do it.	Kaliya ma samayn karo.
He was there.	Halkaas ayuu joogay.
Something will soon be done about what happened to me.	Dhawaan wax ayaa laga qaban doonaa waxa igu dhacay.
And how excited he is to be here.	Iyo sida uu ugu faraxsan yahay inuu halkan joogo.
Maybe you are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tahay.
I really didn't know what to do	Runtii taas maan garanayn inaan sameeyo
I can tell when someone is real	Waxaan sheegi karaa marka qof uu dhab yahay
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
I felt I did not know	Waxa aan dareemay aniga oo aan garanayn
An amazing place, really	Meel aad u yaab leh, runtii
Today is not right for him.	Maanta sax maaha isaga.
I bought it another day	Waxaan iibsaday maalin kale
I have no idea what it might be	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay noqon karto
I hope we will be friends	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqon doono saaxiibo
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
He looked good there.	Si fiican ayuu halkaas uga eegay.
Everyone started talking about it.	Qof kastaa wuxuu bilaabay inuu ka hadlo.
I do it right.	Waxaan u sameeyaa si sax ah.
I was so.	Aad ayaan sidaas u ahaa.
I decided not to say anything	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan waxba odhan
I will take that	Taas waan qaadan doonaa
I really hope he likes it	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inuu jecel yahay
In fact, it is different.	Dhab ahaantii, waa si kale.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
I will not get anything	waxba ma heli doono
Maybe I should	Malaha waa inaan
Give what you can see.	Bixi waxa aad arki karto.
He walked out the front door.	Wuxuu ka soo baxay albaabka hore.
It's really good.	Runtii way fiican tahay.
In fact, that is.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa.
I just need to know how	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida
Often this is what you want to do.	Inta badan tani waa waxa aad rabto inaad sameyso.
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan doonto
I just don’t seem to find the right one	Kaliya uma eka inaan helo mid sax ah
Maybe, maybe he knew.	Malaha, malaha wuu ogaa.
I wish him long work	Waxaan u rajeynayaa shaqo dheer
If you don't, it will definitely happen.	Haddii aadan samayn, hubaal way dhici doontaa.
And let me tell you, it was not much.	Oo aan kuu sheego, ma badna.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I think we can help each other	Waxaan filayaa inaan is caawin karno
Maybe you can even do it.	Malaha xitaa waad samayn kartaa.
I knew something was going to happen	Waan ogaa inay wax dhici doonaan
I did this for about a year	Waxaan taas sameeyay ilaa hal sano
This was not.	Tani ma ahayn.
I would let him know	Waxaan u ogolaan lahaa inuu ogaado
I do not understand why	Maan fahmin sababta
I was just surprised	Waxaan la yaabay oo kaliya
I always wanted to leave	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan baxo
I got everything you need	Waxaan helay wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay
I saw it nearby	Meel dhow ayaan ku arkay
I liked it as he said	Waxaan ka helay sida uu u yidhi
A little better, but not great	Wax yar ka fiican, laakiin wax weyn maaha
You are not alone.	Adiga kaliya maaha.
It will come back, he thought.	Way soo noqon doontaa, ayuu is yidhi.
I took a lot of time from you	Waqti badan ayaan kaa qaatay
Don't go home yet.	Weli guriga ha tagin.
I was not in the room	Maan joogin qolka
I think maybe this should be done now	Waxaan u maleynayaa in laga yaabo in tani ay tahay in la sameeyo hadda
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
Not another.	Mid kale maaha.
She didn't want me to leave.	Ma ay jeclayn inaan baxo.
I need you to do that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad taas sameyso.
I will take that.	Waan qaadan doonaa taas.
I thought it was good	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay u wanaagsan tahay
I have no problem getting to know you better	Wax dhib ah kama qabo inaan si fiican ku barto
You can do it.	Waad samayn kartaa.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
This is later.	Tani waa dambe.
Really, I really started with nothing	Runtii, runtii waxaan ka bilaabay waxba
He had nothing to do with it.	Waxba kuma uu lahayn.
I think that should come as no surprise	Waxaan filayaa inaysan taasi la yaab ku noqon
But it was a great thing.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax aad u fiican.
You will find it interesting.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa mid xiiso leh.
Maybe it was too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidoo kale ahayd.
I did not want to be present	Ma aanan rabin in aan hadda joogo
It's just.	Waa kaliya .
I knew it wasn't true	Waan ogaa inaysan run ahayn
I had him.	waan lahaa isaga.
I did not know she would do so	Maan ogayn inay sidaas samayn doonto
I asked him what he did	Waxa aan waydiiyay waxa uu sameeyay
He had to leave quickly.	Waxay ahayd inuu degdeg u baxo.
I love how it looks !.	Waxaan jeclahay sida ay u egtahay!.
I knew something was not right now	Waxaan ogaa in wax aysan hadda ahayn
It's too long.	Aad bay u dheer tahay.
I told him great work all the time	Waxaan u sheegay shaqo weyn mar walba
That is not what it is.	Taasi maaha waxa ay tahay.
I have not said it yet	Wali uma sheegin
He wanted me at home.	Wuxuu i rabay guriga.
He did not want to.	Ma uu rabin.
As they are tonight.	Sida ay caawa yihiin.
It is enough for me	Waa igu filan tahay
Cannot be seen here	Halkan lama arki karo
I had to find out what happened now	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa hadda dhacay
But no problem.	Laakiin dhib ma lahayn.
I was amazed at what it looked like	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay u egtahay
I was there with you	halkaas ayaan kula joogay
I still haven't found it	Wali maan helin
As much as he can.	Inta uu awoodo.
And he was here.	Oo halkan ayuu ahaa.
Maybe it will help too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidoo kale ku caawin doonto.
Maybe they will come to me on a clear day.	Malaha waxay ii iman doonaan maalin cad.
And it is not interesting.	Oo xiiso ma leh.
No one can help.	Qofna ma caawin karaa.
But you did it before.	Laakiin hore ayaad u samaysay.
I looked	waan eegay
I did not want to leave	Maan rabin inaan ka tago
I had the opportunity to study closely	Waxaan fursad u helay inaan si dhow u barto
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I did not know you had one	Maan ogayn inaad leedahay mid
You have to be seen doing it.	Waa in lagu arko inaad samaynayso.
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
I can't help it with anything	Ma caawin karo wax kasta oo ay tahay
Another, and another.	Mid kale, iyo mid kale.
Free, even.	Lacag la'aan, xitaa.
No one came here.	Ma jiro qof halkan yimid.
I hope everything is fine for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in wax walba ay kugu fiican yihiin.
I really didn't have a place to speak.	Runtii ma haysan meel aan ku hadlo.
Spend time, and eat.	Waqti ku qaado, iyo cunto.
Like, now.	Sida, hadda.
I know how it can be	Waan ogahay sida ay noqon karto
I had to.	Waxay ahayd inaan.
I will not say anything about it.	Waxba ka odhan maayo.
I want him to be in this one.	Waxaan rabaa isaga inuu kan ku jiro.
He had many friends.	Wuxuu lahaa saaxiibo badan.
He is very happy to be here.	Aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay inay halkan joogto.
She refused.	Waxba way diiday.
I would definitely do it.	Hubaal waan yeeli lahaa.
It will be a very long time.	Waxay noqon doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
When they are not with you.	Marka aysan la joogin.
I'm glad I did	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan sidaas sameeyay
It will not hurt you	Wax ku yeeli maayo
I will not get it again.	Mar dambe ma heli doono.
I can't do it now	Ma awoodo hadda
I am a very good person.	Waxaan ahay qof aad u wanaagsan.
But it really didn't matter.	Laakiin runtii dhib ma lahayn.
I never left there	Weligay ma bixin halkaas
It has now been rejected.	Hadda waa loo diiday.
I do it here again.	Waxaan halkan ku sameeyaa mar kale.
It was a place where everything was empty.	Waxay ahayd meel wax kasta oo aan waxba ahayn.
I just picked it up and tried it	Kaliya waan soo qaaday oo isku dayay
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
I have not done anything good for him	Wax wanaagsan kuma aan samayn isaga
Much more.	Wax badan oo kale.
It's not really that difficult.	Runtii sidaas uma dhib badan.
I think it is.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay.
I have never met him	Weligay ma aan helin isaga
He should not be here.	Waa inuusan halkan joogin.
I was very excited	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan
I need to tell you something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax kuu sheego
He was at the door.	Albaabka ayuu ahaa.
If only.	Haddii kaliya.
Not sure how to do this.	Ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
I heard something about it	Wax baan ka maqlay
And let me go back.	Oo aan dib ugu noqdo.
I hope you know that	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas ogtahay
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
Nin adag.	Nin adag.
I broke up.	waan kala tagay.
I would not say.	Maan odhan lahayn.
he is good.	wuu fiican yahay.
I thought you were happy for me	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ii faraxsan tahay
Not much.	Ma badna.
It is always what you want.	Had iyo jeer waa waxa aad rabto.
The former does not.	Kan hore ma doono.
Everything is new.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin.
Sorry about that, all.	Waan ka xumahay taas, dhammaan.
No wonder, really.	La yaab ma leh, runtii.
How interesting it is to find you here.	Sidee xiiso leh inaan halkan kugu helo.
No one else will like it.	Mid kale ma jeclaan doonto.
She had people.	Waxay lahayd dadka.
Do not do anything again.	Wax dib ha u qaban.
You were alone.	Waxaad ahayd keligaa.
It has been so far.	Waxay ahayd sidaas ilaa hadda.
it was me	aniga ayaa ahaa
I thought you were doing that, too	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad sidaas samaynayso, sidoo kale
I was surprised again	Mar kale ayaan la yaabay
Maybe I have too	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale haysto
I do not feel I need to leave	Ma dareemayo inaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
I am very happy about this	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan
I looked around the room	Qolka ayaan ka eegay
I'm sure they will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa inay fiicnaan doonaan.
And had several times.	Oo lahaa dhowr jeer.
I know what they will say to me.	Waan garanayaa waxay iga odhan doonaan.
Can someone please help me with that.	Qof fadlan ma iga caawin karaa taas.
I can do something	Wax waan samayn karaa
I can't stay home today	Maanta guriga ma joogi karo
I have to go	waa inaan tago
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
I would not have otherwise	Si kale uma haysan lahaa
I thought he was.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ahaa.
I think you are like him	Waxaan filayaa in aad isaga la mid tahay
This may actually be true.	Tani waxay dhab ahaan noqon kartaa run.
I knew what had happened	Waan ogaa waxa dhacay
He wanted to help.	Wuxuu rabay inuu caawiyo.
He said he did not like that.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu taas jeclayn.
I bought it today.	Maanta waan iibsaday.
I thought it was a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
That is what it is.	Taasi waa waxa taasi.
And that they do not need it.	Iyo in aanay u baahnayn.
I hope you will be fine.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto.
Maybe he found a friend.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu helay saaxiib.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
No one will leave.	Qofna ma bixi doono.
Give it a chance.	Fursad sii.
I think they still exist	Waxaan filayaa inay weli jiraan
I knew he was happy	Waan ogaa inuu ku faraxsan yahay
If not, no problem.	Haddii aadan, dhib ma leh.
I will do everything for you.	Wax walba waan kuu samayn doonaa.
I could not see well	Si fiican ayaan u arki waayay
I hope you find it interesting	Waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto mid xiiso leh
She did not like this.	Ma ay jeclayn tan.
I was really surprised by that	Runtii taas waan la yaabay
I found it very interesting.	Waxaan u arkay inay tahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
I can get to you at any time	Waqti kasta waan ku heli karaa
Maybe someone was there.	Malaha qof baa meesha joogay.
There was no way out.	Ma jirin meel laga baxo.
I'm sorry but that's the way it is	Waan ka xumahay laakiin waa sida ay tahay
I did not take much	Wax badan maan qaadan
I came up with an idea.	Waxaan la yimid fikrad.
Clever.	Caqli leh.
I think that is enough today	Waxaan filayaa in taasi maanta ku filan tahay
Nothing bigger.	Wax ka sii weyn ma aha.
Nothing will stop	Waxba ma joojin doono
I just want to see it done	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko in la sameeyay
You did not do the same.	Wax la mid ah ma aadan samayn.
I also had it at school	Waxaan sidoo kale ku lahaa dugsiga
I will be at work tomorrow.	Berrito shaqada ayaan joogi doonaa.
Obviously I didn’t like the place.	Si cad ma jeclayn meesha.
I was there	waan joogay
It was really a bad time	Runtii waxay ahayd wakhti aad u xun
I thought he was a good man for you	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu nin wanaagsan kuu yahay
Just too much.	Kaliya aad u badan.
He didn't want to talk about it, either.	Ma uusan rabin inuu ka hadlo, sidoo kale.
Maybe I should go	Malaha waa inaan tago
I could not tell him.	Waan u sheegi waayay.
Great and fast	Mid weyn oo degdeg ah
It really is here.	Runtii waa halkan.
I was really close friends	Runtii waxaan ahaa saaxiib dhow
Available	Waa la heli karaa
What is not available may remain.	Waxa aan la heli karin ayaa laga yaabaa inay sii jiraan.
She did not speak again.	Dib uma aysan hadlin.
You think so, but it's not.	Waad u malaynaysaa sidaas, laakiin maaha.
And everyone loves it here, too.	Oo qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay halkan, sidoo kale.
I just wanted to know what to do	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan ogaado inaad sameyso
He was who he was.	Wuxuu ahaa kii uu ahaa.
Not everyone likes that.	Qof walba ma jecla taas.
I hope this will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
I'm happy to be here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
I need to work on it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo
It would go away for sure.	Waxay ka bixi lahayd hubaal.
I really haven't got that yet	Runtii taas maan helin ilaa hadda
I know you know that.	Waan ogahay inaad taas ogtahay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
He was empty now.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aan waxba haysan hadda.
I will not be like that	Anigu sidaas oo kale ahaan maayo
What's up? 	Maxaa jira?
She had no money.	Wax lacag ah ma ay haysan.
he was ready.	diyaar buu ahaa.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
I should never have gone	Ma ahayn inaan weligay tagin
It is the same day.	Waa isku maalin.
It was a very exciting but quick time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti aad u xiiso badan laakiin degdeg ah.
He has as much as I was told.	Waxa uu leeyahay inta la ii sheegay.
It's like three times.	Waa sida saddex mar.
I do not understand, but that is correct	Maan fahmin, laakiin taasi waa sax
I do not have much time	Waqti badan ma hayo
I just have to do it.	Kaliya waa inaan sameeyo.
Certainly long.	Hubaal muddo dheer.
Something for everyone.	Qof walba wax u leh.
This is very good.	Tani aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
will do it.	ku samayn doonaa.
I want you, in whatever way you can	Waan ku rabaa, si kasta oo aad u malayn karto
I have nothing good to say	Ma hayo wax fiican oo aan sheego
I don't care	Waxba igama hayo
I haven't had anyone for a long time.	Qofna maan haysan muddo dheer.
I just can't do this	Kaliya tan ma sameyn karo
And they really do.	Oo runtii way sameeyaan.
Not really sure how to do this.	Runtii ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
Everyone who has been to him knows that this is true.	Qof kasta oo isaga u ahaa wuu garanayaa inay taasi run tahay.
They really didn't know.	Runtii ma ay garanayn.
But you know it was.	Laakiin waad ogtahay inay ahayd.
Do not leave anything to chance.	Waxba ha uga tagin fursad.
Please would not stop	Fadlan ma joojin lahayd
I know he does.	Waan ogahay inuu sameeyo.
No one is able to find him.	Qofna ma awoodo inuu helo isaga.
You can do this !!.	Waxaad samayn kartaa tan!!.
I think they are a bit beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inay xoogaa qurux badan yihiin
A little bit of what’s going on.	In yar oo ka mid ah waxa socda.
Let me find something good.	Aan wax wanaagsan helo.
Maybe this will help someone else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay caawin doonto qof kale.
Let me know what he says.	Aan ogaado waxa uu leeyahay.
It was not a bad thing.	Wax xun ma ahayn.
In fact, it can be very true.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon kartaa run badan.
I did nothing tonight	Caawa waxba maan qaban
I took it seriously	Waxaan u qaatay si dhab ah
But they make money.	Laakiin waxay sameeyaan lacag.
I did everything	Wax walba waan sameeyay
You did not do anything similar.	Ma aadan samayn wax la mid ah.
It looks like a lot of work.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo aad u badan.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
Not so much.	Aad uma eka.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
I do not want to do that now	Anigu hadda ma rabo inaan sidaas sameeyo
And why.	Iyo sababta.
I think this is not a good idea	Waxaan filayaa in tani aysan ahayn fikrad wanaagsan
Maybe I should	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan sameeyo
It can be very difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
I could not stretch	Waan kala bixi waayay
But a little bit.	Laakiin mid yar oo yar.
I want to be like you, friend.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo adiga oo kale, saaxiib.
I knew what would happen	Waan ogaa waxa dhici doona
He probably saw something good to say.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu u arkay wax fiican inuu sheego.
I've heard it before, long ago	Mar hore ayaan maqlay, waa hore ka hor
Not sure what it was, either.  	Ma hubo waxay ahayd, sidoo kale.  
I hurried in.	Si degdeg ah ayaan u soo galay.
Much is needed.	Wax badan ayaa loo baahan yahay.
A few years later something similar	Dhowr sano ka dib wax la mid ah
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I still owe you food	Weli cunto baan kugu leeyahay
Everything is fine.	Wax walba wuu ku fiican yahay.
I think it is in me	Waxa aan filayaa in ay aniga igu jirto
He does not like to talk about it.	Ma jecla inuu ka hadlo.
The rest I love.	Inta kale ee aan jeclahay.
No problem.	Dhibaato ma jirto.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba uma aha.
I wondered how she did that	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay taas u samaysay
But it can happen.	Laakiin way dhici kartaa.
But they are enough.	Laakiin waa ku filan yihiin.
I didn’t stop working on it, either	Maan joojin in aan ka shaqeeyo, sidoo kale
A man is still a man.	Nin weli waa nin.
Not sure how and why.	Ma hubo sida iyo sababta.
We will see what we can do.	Waan arki doonaa waxaan sameyn karno.
But that is now.	Laakiin taasi waa hadda.
I want to see what he can do.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko waxa uu sameyn karo.
I do that all the time.	Taas ayaan sameeyaa mar walba.
I can handle everything.	Wax walba waan ka bixi karaa.
Let it come.	Ha yimaado.
I am very sure of that	Aad ayaan u hubaa taas
I think it was the best thing for him	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan isaga
I really found a good place	Runtii meel fiican ayaan helay
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
It has just started.	Waa la bilaabay hadda.
I was really surprised	Runtii waan la yaabay
he will say.	wuxuu odhan doonaa.
I knew it would happen.	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto.
A long time to do this.	Waqti dheer oo tan la sameeyo.
But there may be more to it than that.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax ka badan taas.
It sounds like something everyone wants.	Waxay u egtahay wax qof walba doonayo.
I thought she was lucky.	Waxaan u malayn jiray inay nasiib tahay.
A little too much.	Xoogaa aad u badan.
Just everyone.	Kaliya qof walba.
They probably won't see it again.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan mar dambe arki doonin.
I wondered if it would come out or not	Waxaan la yaabay inuu soo bixi doono iyo in kale
I wanted to talk	Waxaan rabay inaan hadlo
I found him.	waan helay isaga.
I thought it was a good idea	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan
I can not leave, there must be more	Kama tagi karo, waa in ay jiraan wax badan
I think it is	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
But it was true.	Laakiin run bay ahayd.
I think he can help	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku caawin karo
Everyone else is about to leave.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa ku dhow inuu la baxo.
This is going to be great.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
No one went.	Qofna ma tagin.
That is, it is not yet.	Taasi waa, weli ma aha.
He really wanted to.	Run buu rabay.
It cannot be that it does not exist.	Ma noqon karto in aysan jirin.
But I did not get it.	Laakiin ma helin.
I could not do anything	Waxba maan qaban karin
I need to talk to you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
I might as well tell you now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale kuu sheego hadda.
I think we can talk to him	Waxaan filayaa inaan kala hadli karno isaga
Much in one	Wax badan oo ku jira hal
What do you think will happen?	Maxaad u malaynaysaa inuu dhici doono?.
But certainly not now.	Laakiin hubaal hadda maaha.
It is a beautiful thing to do and see.	Waa wax qurux badan in la sameeyo oo la arko.
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
Everyone had a place to stay.	Qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa meel uu joogo.
I went once.	Hal mar ayaan aaday.
She told me something.	Wax bay ii sheegtay.
It really is the same.	Runtii waa isku mid.
I would love you, I would do everything for you	Waan ku jeclaan lahaa, wax walba waan kuu samayn lahaa
I really can't say.	Runtii ma sheegi karin.
For the most part, this is true.	Inta badan, tani waa run.
He can do whatever he wants.	Waxa uu rabo wuu samayn karaa.
This is not correct	Tani sax maaha
I just want you to be here	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan joogto
A place to talk.	Meel lagu hadlo.
That can happen to anyone.	Taasi waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta.
I am very sorry for him.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga.
I think everything is correct	Waxaan filayaa in wax walba ay sax yihiin
I will not say.	Ma odhan doono.
What will happen?	Maxaa dhici doona?.
I knew it would be for me	Waan ogaa inay aniga ii ahaan lahayd
I did not know what was going on	Ma garanayn waxa socda
He always was.	Mar walba wuu ahaa.
I always wanted to	Mar walba waan rabay
Not as before, but.	Ma aha sidii hore, laakiin.
Long, long.	Waqti dheer, dheer.
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
I think that is not true	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aysan run ahayn
I tried but I came back.	Waan isku dayay laakiin waan soo noqday.
I can't hurt anyone like that	Ma yeeli karo qof sidaas oo kale ah
I have nothing else to say.	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan sheego.
More than anything and everyone.	In ka badan wax walba iyo qof walba.
I can't believe what you just told me	Ma rumaysan karo waxaad hadda ii sheegtay
I saw something else	Wax kale ayaan arkay
But here is the problem.	Laakiin halkan waa dhibaato.
I knew they were close.	Waan ogaa inay isku dhow yihiin.
I did not know what to say	Wax aan u sheego maan garanayn
I should not have been here	Ma ahayn inaan halkan joogo
Really beautiful.	Runtii wax qurux badan.
It's so good.	Waa sidaas u fiican.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
You can not believe it.	Ma rumaysan kartid.
I was not ready for that	Diyaar uma ahayn taas
I look forward to working with you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
I do not want to leave.	Ma rabo inaan baxo.
It is unbelievable.	Maaha wax la rumaysan karo.
Several went home	Dhowr ayaa aaday guriga
I do not know what he is doing.	Waxa uu samaynayo ma garanayo.
I have not seen him yet	Wali ma arag isaga
Not this.	Ma aha tan.
I can give that to you	Taas waan ku siin karaa
It really isn't.	Runtii uma eka.
I will not be fired	La igama joojin doono shaqada
What is it to me.	Aniga waa maxay.
I still want to see what happens	Wali waxaan rabaa inaan arko waxa dhici doona
I do not know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
You look small.	Waxaad u egtahay mid yar.
I can't believe anyone can hurt me	Ma rumaysan karo in qofna uu wax yeeli karo
You can do everything beautifully.	Si qurux badan ayaad wax walba u samayn kartaa.
I'm a bit out	xoogaa waan baxay
You didn’t have to do it, whatever you did.	Ma ahayn inaad samayso, wax kasta oo aad samaysay.
I got him time	Waxaan ku helay isaga waqti
She was unable to do so.	Way awoodi wayday inay samayso.
No, either.	Ma jiro, sidoo kale.
I did not know what happened	Ma garanayn waxa dhacay
I really hope that is true	Waxaan aad u rajeynayaa in taasi run tahay
This could be.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa.
I know what it is.	Waan ogahay waxa ay tahay.
I do not know what happened now	Ma garanayo waxa hadda dhacay
Definitely more today.	Hubaal in ka badan maanta.
Now he will give it to you.	Hadda wuu ku siin doonaa.
I hope so	Waxaan rajeynayaa sidaas
I hope you will be fine and all	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto iyo dhammaan
But it was something else as well.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax kale sidoo kale.
I should not be here.	Waa inaan halkaan joogin.
You can find it interesting.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa si xiiso leh.
I want you to do what you want	Waxaan kaa rabaa inaad ku sameyso waxaad rabto
He tried well.	Si wanaagsan ayuu isku dayay.
He is not a bad man.	Nin xun maaha.
I should have been there for you	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas kuu joogo
He is always there.	Mar walba wuu joogaa.
I wanted to see the place again	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale arko meesha
I knew it was him	Waan ogaa inuu isaga ahaa
Some time ago.	Muddo ka hor.
I can hardly believe it	Si dhib ah ayaan u rumaysan karaa
I had to stay home	Waxay ahayd inaan guriga sii joogo
Slightly bigger but still beautiful	In yar ka weyn laakiin weli qurux badan
Let me tell you.	Aan kuu sheego.
I made you what you are	Waxaan kaa dhigay waxaad tahay
Probably very happy	Malaha aad u faraxsan
I pretended I did not know why	Waxaan iska dhigay inaanan garanayn sababta
I have to go there tomorrow	Waa inaan berrito halkaas tago
This is the same thing.	Tani waxay la mid tahay wax la mid ah.
Maybe you do something worse.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sameyso wax ka sii xun.
Most of the time we don't do that.	Inta badan taas ma samayno.
I can get it now	Hadda waan ku heli karaa
I can't see who she is	Ma arki karo qofka ay tahay
I looked at him intently	Aad ayaan u eegay isaga
Tell her how it is.	U sheeg sida ay tahay.
I knew very little about him	Wax yar ayaan ka ogaa isaga
I have to do it	Waa inaan sameeyaa
Great day.	Maalin weyn.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
A lot of money will be needed for that.	Lacag badan ayaa loo baahan doonaa taas.
I can't see anything bad here	Halkan wax xun kuma arki karo
I know, everything	Waan ogahay, wax walba
And not only that.	Oo kaliya ma aha.
I really like you very much	Runtii waan ku jeclahay si fiican
I did not leave and a man saw me	Maan ka tagin oo nin baa i arkay
I knew how much she loved me	Waan ogaa sida ay ii jeceshahay
Making.	Samaynta.
I can talk without difficulty	Waan la hadli karaa dhib la'aan
I could not have imagined that.	Maan u malayn karin sidaas.
He is much better now.	Hadda aad ayuu uga fiican yahay.
They need to do so.	Waxay u baahan yihiin inay sidaas sameeyaan.
I did nothing wrong	Wax xun maan samayn
I have no idea what it is	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa uu yahay
Everything is fine.	Wax walba waa wanaagsan yihiin.
I was surprised he even picked it up	Waxaan la yaabay inuu xitaa soo qaaday
He looked at me a little surprised.	In yar ayuu si yaab leh ii eegay.
I am just like you.	Waxaan la mid ahay adiga oo kale.
I wish you were here longer	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan in badan joogto
Certainly not.	Runtii sidaas maaha .
You can't do this to people.	Tan dadka kuma samayn kartid.
It must exist	Waa inuu jiraa
He still does the same.	Weli sidaas oo kale ayuu sameeyaa.
I did the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan ku sameeyay.
Still not sure.	Weli ma hubo.
I will do it for you	Adiga ayaan kaa yeeli doonaa
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
I heard a little, I saw nothing	Wax yar baan maqlay, waxba ma arag
I did not know it would be a problem	Maan ogayn inay dhibaato noqon doonto
I really didn't speak	Runtii lama aan hadlin
It didn't matter who he was.	Dhib ma lahayn cidda uu yahay.
I'm happy to be here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaan joogo
I don't think she does.	Uma maleynayo inay sameyso.
he is good.	wuu fiican yahay.
I really did not want to	Dhab ahaantii ma aanan rabin
I love coming back again and again	Waxaan jeclahay inaan soo noqdo mar kale iyo mar kale
You were right, it was the right thing to do.	Waxaad ahayd sax, waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
Even tonight, if you will.	Xitaa caawa, haddii aad rabto.
I would like him to get a permanent job.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu helo shaqo joogto ah.
That was smart.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid caqli badan.
It was a good time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti fiican.
I'm really happy about that.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa mid adag.
I do not see, as a man sees	Anigu ma arko, sida nin u arko
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor.
I am always very busy, whatever	Had iyo jeer aad ayaan mashquul u ahay, wax kasta
There is, for sure.	Waxaa jira, hubaal.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
I don't know where he is.	Ma garanayo meel uu joogo.
I want to do something	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax sameeyo
What would any of us do.	Maxaa qof naga mid ah lahaa.
This is also good.	Tani sidoo kale waa fiican tahay.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
I want to learn more	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan barto
Only one got it.	Mid kaliya ayaa helay.
I did not understand why she would need it	Maan fahmin sababta ay ugu baahan doonto
It looks like something he has already done.	Waxay u egtahay wax uu hore u sameeyay.
This can be a bad idea.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa fikrad xun.
I told him he probably didn't like it	Waxaan u sheegay inay u badan tahay inuusan jeclayn
I think that is not a good idea right now	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aysan ahayn fikrad wanaagsan hadda
It is somewhere else.	Waa meel kale.
I know what you did	Waan ogahay waxaad samaysay
Until he comes is another.	Ilaa inta uu iman doono waa mid kale.
I will do one.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa mid.
He had a lot.	Wax badan buu lahaa.
I asked to see the room	Waxaan codsaday inaan arko qolka
I knew you were there	Waan ogaa inaad halkaas joogto
I hope you have a great day.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad leedahay maalin weyn.
He wondered what it could be.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa ay noqon karto.
I only got one chance	Hal fursad oo kaliya ayaan helay
I can't do anything right now	Hadda waxba kama qaban karo
I would love to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
I just want to stay here for a while	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan sii joogo in muddo ah
What are they?	Maxay yihiin.
You can help people with this.	Taas waxaad ka caawin kartaa dadka.
I had a job.	Waxaan lahaa shaqo.
She was not here tonight.	Ma ay joogin halkan caawa.
I did not come to cause trouble	Uma iman inaan dhibaato sameeyo
I wish you could see	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad arki lahayd
This is the only way to do it.	Tani waa sida kaliya ee loo sameeyo.
I knew they would not do it	Waan ogaa inaysan yeeli doonin
But that is not really a problem.	Laakiin taasi runtii dhibaato maaha.
I'm not sure why	Ma hubo sababta ay sidaas u tahay
I just wanted to see how you are	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan arko sida aad tahay
I had to say that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas u sheego
I will be at the door	albaabka ayaan joogi doonaa
As it was with me.	Sidii ay aniga ila ahayd.
I never really thought about that before	Weligay runtii taas ka hor uma malaynayo
But you were real.	Laakiin dhab baad ahayd.
Obviously we can't say anything she said.	Sida iska cad waxba kama sheegi karno waxay tidhi.
That will take a very long time.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
A little.	Wax yar.
I knew it was too much, too fast	Waan ogaa in ay aad u badan tahay, aad u degdeg badan tahay
I thought the same thing some time ago	Waxaan u maleeyay wax la mid ah waqti hore
Not me.	Aniga igama aha.
But still alive.	Laakiin weli nool.
Obviously you can't be friends	Sida iska cad saaxiib lama noqon karo
I know what they are.	Waan ogahay waxay yihiin.
I get nothing.	Waxba ma helo.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii badan.
And near the house.	Oo guriga u dhow.
He was great to work with.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u fiican in la shaqeeyo.
It could not be done.	Waa la qaban waayay.
That is not all.	Taas oo kaliya maaha.
It was his favorite.	Waxay ahayd uu jecel yahay.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha taasi waa sax.
I used to cook	Waan karin jiray
I did not get this.	Anigu ma helin tan.
I have no idea what he is saying.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa uu leeyahay.
I can't find it now	Hadda ma heli karo
They looked at each other.	Waa la is eegay.
I think he really loves me	Waxaan filayaa inuu runtii i jecel yahay
I know someone.	Waan ogahay qof.
I have one for myself	Waxaan leeyahay mid ka mid ah aniga
I really did not know where you were	Run ahaantii maan garanayn meel aad joogto
We need it.	Waanu u baahanahay.
I tried, but there was no time	Waan isku dayay, laakiin waqti ma jirin
I did not like it, but it was what it was	Maan jeclayn, laakiin waxay ahayd waxay ahayd
He wanted to talk.	Wuxuu rabay inuu hadlo.
I have not received it yet	Ilaa hadda maan helin
He can do whatever he wants.	Waxa uu rabo ayuu ku samayn karaa.
He is just a man.	Waa nin kaliya.
I did not want anyone to know	Maan rabin in qofna ogaado
I still do not understand.	Wali ma fahmin.
There was not much.	Wax badan ma jirin.
It's only a matter of time.	Waa muddo kaliya.
I did not do anything right	Wax sax ah maan samayn
I will talk to you.	waan la hadli doonaa.
Someone was in the room with you.	Qof baa halkan qolka kula jiray.
But right now I'm not really sure.	Laakiin hadda aad uma hubo.
This is well done.	Tani si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I hope you can help me with a problem	Waxaan filayaa inaad iga caawin karto dhibaato
And so you were most of the time.	Oo sidaas ayaad ahayd inta badan.
Like everything else.	Sida wax kasta oo kale.
He looked again, but it was someone else.	Mar kale ayuu eegay, laakiin waxay ahayd qof kale.
I haven't seen him in a while	In muddo ah ma aan arag isaga
I want to be with you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo
Maybe she already has.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hore u leedahay.
But, it can be done.	Laakiin, waa la samayn karaa.
That is really interesting.	Taasi runtii waa mid xiiso leh.
I told you what would happen	Waxaan kuu sheegay waxa dhici doona
I think he did something else today	Waxaan filayaa inuu wax kale sameeyay maanta
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
I wonder if any of this is true	Waxaan la yaabay in mid ka mid ah tani run tahay
Let's do this.	Aan samayno tan.
It seems obvious to me.	Aniga waxay ila tahay wax cad.
I love you for this	Waxaan adiga kugu jeclahay tan
I have one for myself.	Waxaan leeyahay mid ka mid ah aniga.
I can't take much	Wax badan kama qaadan karo
I did not know where to go	Meel aan tago maan garanayn
Please do not take anything from here.	Fadlan halkan waxba ha ka qaadan.
I hope you will find it here	Waxaan filayaa inaad halkan ka heli doonto
This is the best way to get it	Tani waa sida ugu fiican ee loo helo
The only thing we can do about it.	Kaliya waxa aan ka qaban karno.
I don't feel anything for him	Anigu waxba isaga uma dareemayo
And much later.	Iyo wax badan ka dib.
I saw little of it.	Wax yar baan ka arkay.
We will talk tomorrow.	Berri ayaan wada hadli doonaa.
Nin.	Nin.
A car arrived.	Baabuur baa yimid.
I know it's not true for everyone.	Waan ogahay inaysan run u ahayn qof walba.
I decided not to talk about it.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan ka hadlin.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
Now I can do a good job	Hadda waxaan u samayn karaa shaqada wanaagsan
But this is uncertain.	Laakiin tani lama hubo.
He seemed happy to talk about it.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu ka hadlo.
I even went ahead	Xitaa waan ka soo hor baxay
I entered the back room	Qolka dambe ayaan galay
It's hard there.	Way adag tahay halkaas.
People younger than me.	Dadka iga yar.
I knew it would happen.	Waan ogaa inay dhici doonto.
Here to help.	Halkan si aad u caawiso.
He can be anywhere.	Meel kasta wuu joogi karaa.
But you will be better off.	Laakiin si fiican ayaad u fiicnaan doontaa.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
A lot closer to me.	Wax badan iga dhow.
He is likely to do the same.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu sameeyo sidoo kale.
That is fast.	Taasi waa si degdeg ah.
She did not return.	Ma ay soo noqon.
I shouldn't have done that, he thought	Ma ahayn in aan taas sameeyo, ayuu is yidhi
It was something.	Wax buu ahaa.
They really love each other.	Runtii way is jecel yihiin.
I tried everything.	Wax walba waan isku dayay.
I thought he would do this regularly	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu tan si joogto ah u sameeyo
I won't be here much longer.	In badan ma joogi doono halkan.
I was lucky for him	Nasiib baan lahaa isaga
He wants to know if it's real.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ogaado inay dhab tahay.
I put him in jail	Waxaan dhigay xabsiga
No trouble tonight	Caawa uma iman dhib
I hope it comes out.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu soo baxo.
Still very good.	Weli aad u fiican.
That was a bit lucky indeed.	Taasi waxay ahayd xoogaa nasiib ah runtii.
Maybe he would do anything if I was sorry for him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax walba sameeyo haddii aan ka xumahay isaga.
He did something bad.	Waxa uu sameeyay wax xun.
Would it be better.	Ma ka fiicnaan lahayd.
Three and three.	Saddex iyo saddex.
I am very happy	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay
They did not do well.	Si fiican uma ay qaban.
She said badly.	Waxay tidhi si xun.
He seemed to have a good time.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid wakhti fiican qaatay.
The reason for this is still unknown	Sababta arrintan ayaan weli la garanayn
I had no appointment	Ballan maan lahayn
I think it was the right thing to do	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo
So all.	Sidaas oo dhan.
You can also get a job.	Waxaad sidoo kale heli kartaa shaqo.
I did not know where you were	Meel aad joogto maan garanayn
None of us.	Mid naga mid ah ma jiro.
I can't do this anymore	Tan kuma samayn karo mar dambe
I took it back	Dib ayaan u qaaday
You can’t get too much.	Ma heli kartid wax aad u badan.
All the better.	Dhammaan ka wanaagsan.
I could not stretch	Waan kala bixi waayay
Today, it was hard work.	Maanta, waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
I can do that for him	Taas waan u samayn karaa isaga
That will do now.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa hadda.
Probably not.	Malaha maaha.
I saw everyone	Waxaan arkay dadka oo dhan
Not every day.	Ma aha maalin kasta.
At work, less.	Shaqada, wax ka yar.
It was not very good	Ma ahayn mid aad u wanaagsan
But it has been tried, you know.	Laakiin waa la isku dayay, waad ogtahay.
I'm sorry about that	Waan ka xumahay taas
I just got that idea	Kaliya waxaan ka helay taas fikrad ahaan
I always knew you were great	Mar walba waan ogaa inaad weyn tahay
I know that is hard for you	Waan ogahay inay taasi kugu adag tahay
I knew there was something wrong with you	Waan ogaa inay wax kaa jiraan
I'm afraid you won't love me anymore	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaadan mar dambe i jeclayn
How good it is for him.	Sidee u fiican isaga.
Now it will be over.	Hadda waan dhammaan doonaa.
It can only do so much.	Waxa kaliya oo ay samayn kartaa wax badan.
It was no surprise.	Ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
You will see why.	Waad arki doontaa sababta.
I did not understand much	Wax badan maan fahmin
Really well done.	Runtii si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
The best is there.	Waxa ugu fiican ayaa jira.
Whatever that is.	Wax kasta oo taasi tahay.
There is so much available.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la heli karo.
I just knew he was.	Kaliya waan ogaa inuu yahay.
In fact, they do.	Dhab ahaantii, way sameeyaan.
I will stay there	Waan joogi doonaa halkaas
He has the place.	Meesha ayuu leeyahay.
So little new.	Sidaas cusub oo yar.
That is to be expected.	Taasi waa la filayaa.
I have never really seen it before.	Run ahaantii hore uma arag.
I know you can do the job	Waan ogahay inaad qaban karto shaqada
I am a bad friend.	Waxaan ahay saaxiib xun.
What a wonderful day.	Waa maxay maalin yaab leh.
I think it was	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ahayd
I just need to get it alone	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan keligiis helo
I need time to work on this	Waxaan u baahanahay wakhti si aan tan uga shaqeeyo
I need to know more	Waa inaan wax badan ka ogaado
I will discuss this later.	Dib ayaan uga hadli doonaa arrintan.
Maybe she couldn't, yet.	Malaha way awoodi wayday, wali.
I thought you were in trouble	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad dhibaato ku jirto
I just didn't see it.	Kaliya maan arag.
I want you to know something	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax ogaato
I wanted to know.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado.
I don't have much there.	Wax badan uma hayo halkaas.
I know what it does to people	Waan ogahay waxa ay dadka ku sameyso
I don't think she can keep it.	Uma malaynayo inay sii haysan karto.
It has other things going on.	Waxay leedahay waxyaabo kale oo socda.
I hope so.	Aan rajaynayo.
I no longer work there	Hadda kama sii shaqeeyo halkaas
You cannot be everything to everyone.	Qof walba wax walba uma noqon kartid.
I couldn’t stop, even a little bit	Ma joojin karin, xitaa in yar
What a great new idea.	Waa maxay fikrad cusub oo aad u fiican.
I have to do something else	Waa inaan wax kale sameeyaa
you were not present	ma aadan joogin
Obviously I can't even do this right	Sida iska cad xitaa tan sax uma samayn karo
I think that's a good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan
Rabay.	Rabay.
I can't get over this	Ma ka bixi karo tan
I left nothing	Waxba kama tagin
Whatever you have to do.	Wax kasta oo ay tahay inaad sameyso.
is it.	ma waxay tahay.
He lives at home.	Guriga ayuu ku nool yahay.
But he never came out.	Laakiin waligiis ma uusan soo bixin.
It looks fresh and good.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid cusub oo wanaagsan.
Maybe you can tell me.	Malaha waxaad ii sheegi kartaa.
Don't do that to him.	Taas ha ku samayn isaga.
No, you know they don't exist.	Maaha oo waad ogtahay in aanay jirin.
Maybe even better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xitaa ka sii fiican.
They did not do well.	Si fiican uma ay qaban.
I have something here to say.	Waxa aan halkan ku hayaa wax uu yidhi.
He is taller than me, almost too.	Aniga ayaa iga dheer, oo ku dhow sidoo kale.
She should not believe him.	Ma aha inay rumaysan lahayd isaga.
Good thing, too.	Wax fiican, sidoo kale.
Maybe it should be done for me	Waxaa laga yaabaa in la ii sameeyo
I just knew I wasn’t at my best	Waxaan ogaa oo kaliya inaanan ku jirin sida ugu fiican
I am not like you.	ma ihi adiga oo kale.
It will not happen	U dhici maayo
It looks so bad	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xun
There is no bigger one here.	Ma jiro mid ka weyn halkan.
I looked at it more strangely than before	Si ka sii yaab badan sidii hore ayaan u eegay
It will be a long and difficult job.	Waxay noqon doontaa shaqo dheer oo adag.
He did not want to.	Ma uusan rabin.
I wish it was not so	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan sidaas ahayn
It is definitely great.	Hubaal way weyn tahay.
Something you like	Wax aad jeceshahay
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u qurux badan.
You will get everything you need.	Waxaad heli doontaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
It is always known.	Had iyo jeer waa la yaqaan.
No one can help me.	Qofna ma i caawin karaa.
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
And there is nothing better, either.	Oo wax kale oo wanaagsan ma jiro, sidoo kale.
Tell them when it is too much.	U sheeg marka ay aad u badan tahay.
Who took that.	Yaa qaatay taas.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
Very difficult for me.	Aniga ahaan aad ii dhib badan.
But he did not know.	Laakiin taas ma uu ogayn.
I was told how to go.	Waxa la ii sheegay sidii aan ku tagi lahaa.
You can't do this.	Ma samayn kartid tan.
Now it is non-existent.	Hadda waa wax aan jirin.
I think you need to be here	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad u baahan tahay inaad halkaan joogto
I was everything	Waxaan ahaa wax walba
Someone was there.	Qof baa meesha joogay.
It was not true.	Run ma ahayn.
I thought you were better than that	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad taas ka fiican tahay
It is something I know very well.	Waa wax aan aad u garanayo.
I need food now	Waxaan u baahanahay cunto hadda
i love you friend	waan ku jeclahay saaxiib
No major problems were reported.	Wax dhibaato weyn ah lama soo sheegin.
I decided to stay.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan joogo.
No one said anything	Qofna waxba uma odhan
I still do this regularly	Weli waxaan u sameeyaa tan si joogto ah
I would definitely be here again.	Waxaan hubaal ahaan lahaa halkan mar kale.
he wondered.	ayuu is waydiiyay.
I always cooked	Mar walba waan karin jiray
He will surely come to you.	Sida cad wuu kuu iman doonaa.
I will not say anything about it	Waxba ka odhan maayo
I saw what you did	Waxaan arkay waxaad ku samaysay
There is something you should also know.	Waxaa jira wax ay tahay inaad sidoo kale ogaato.
It was, as it were.	Waxay ahayd, sida.
I wondered why he was here	Waxaan la yaabay sababta uu halkan u joogo
I could not leave him	Waan ka tagi waayay isaga
That is correct	Taasi waa sax
No one will give me a chance.	Qofna fursad i siin maayo.
I know this can be a difficult time	Waan ogahay in tani ay noqon karto waqti adag
I would leave	Waan ka bixi lahaa

She didn't have much time.	Ma aysan haysan waqti badan.
We will provide you with everything you need	Waxaan ku siin doonaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay
At first, he could see nothing.	Markii hore, waxba ma uu arki karin.

Now it is enough for us.	Hadda ayaa nagu filan.
I have heard that it has been done to several people before	Waxaan maqlay in dhowr qof lagu sameeyay hadda ka hor
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
I would like to know if he is there	Waxaan jeclahay inaan ogaado inuu halkaas joogo
Everyone is a friend.	Qof walba waa saaxiib.
It is only this.	Waa tan kaliya.
I could not believe he could do this to me	Ma aan rumaysan karin inuu tan igu samayn karo
I think she may be able to help you	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay awoodi karto inay ku caawiso

That is good to know.	Taasi way wanaagsan tahay in la ogaado.
As it was.	Sida uu ahaa.
I also wanted to talk to you	Waxaan sidoo kale rabay inaan kula hadlo
He was ready for that.	Taas ayuu diyaar u ahaa.
I was made to stay here	Waxaa la i dhigay inaan halkaan joogo
Everyone has something in it.	Qof walba wax baa ku jira.
Not very interesting.	Ma aha mid aad u xiiso badan.
And one and the other.	Iyo mid kale iyo mid kale.
But for sure.	Laakiin waa hubaal.
But it really is not.	Laakiin run ahaantii maaha.
This will not end well.	Tani si wanaagsan kuma dhammaan doonto.
You know that as well as everyone.	Waad ogtahay taas iyo sidoo kale qof kasta.
Please tell me he is fine.	Fadlan ii sheeg inuu fiican yahay.
No one can do it any other way.	Qofna ma samayn karo si kale.
Some time ago.	Waqti ka hor.
I looked around the room to find out why	Waxaan eegay qolka si aan u ogaado sababta
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
I found something new	Waxaan helay wax cusub
I have many friends	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo badan
I need some time now.	Waxaan hadda u baahanahay xoogaa waqti ah.
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
Like, after all, he knows how.	Sida, ka dib oo dhan, wuu ogyahay sida.
So far, nothing very good.	Ilaa hadda, ma jiraan wax aad u wanaagsan.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa.
I know what you are doing	Waan ogahay waxaad samaynayso
He is there. 	Halkaas ayuu joogaa.

I can't stay with you	Kuma joogi karo adiga
He cannot be here alone	Keligiis halkan kuma joogi karo

I can't stop now.	Hadda ma joojin karo.
That’s really what we do.	Runtii taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
I think we can do this	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan sameyn karno tan
He went somewhere else.	Meel kale ayuu aaday.
I can't even take it too late	Xitaa ma qaadan karo goor dambe

I wanted to go home now	Waxaan rabay inaan hadda aado guriga
It will be needed	Waa loo baahan doonaa
I do not want to leave anyone	Ma rabo inaan cidna ka tago
Not just who I am.	Kaliya maaha qofka aan ahay.

I love it so much !.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay!.
I do not have a place to speak at all	Ma haysto meel aan ku hadlo oo dhan
It is also very complex.	Sidoo kale waa mid aad u adag.
It will be.	Wuu ahaan doonaa.
I have never been there in a long time	Weligay ma joogin muddo dheer

I need someone to talk to	Waxaan u baahanahay qof aan la hadlo
I was always there	Mar walba waan joogay
I just want to see him.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko isaga.

Everyone knows we are good friends.	Qof walba waa ogyahay inaan nahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Maybe he likes it that way.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidaas jecel yahay.
But not often.	Laakiin maaha inta badan.
I doubt we will see again	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inaan mar kale arki doono
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
I did nothing	Waxba maan samayn
I would help, you know.	Waan caawin lahaa, waad ogtahay.
But it was a good surprise.	Laakiin waxa ay ahayd yaab wanaagsan.
I know that no one can give me enough money	Waan ogahay in qofna uusan i siin karin lacag igu filan
I hope she can take it	Waxaan rajeynayaa in ay ka qaadan karto
I think it is enough	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku filan yahay
He was another great man.	Nin kale oo weyn buu ahaa.
I will not do that	Anigu sidaas uma yeeli doono
I just wish we could do more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa kaliya inaan sameyn karno wax badan

I haven't done much else, in a long time	Wax badan oo kale maan qaban, muddo dheer
I can talk about him	Waan ka hadli karaa isaga
If he had known more, he would not have said.	Haddii uu wax badan ka ogaa, ma uu sheegay.
That is not what we do.	Taasi maaha waxa aan samayno.
There are several.	Waxaa jira dhowr.
It's too early.	Waa hore.

I know, you look like one.	Waan ogahay, waxaad u egtahay mid.
I did not give it, it may be correct	Ma aanan siin, waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sax yahay
Someone to get something.	Qof inuu wax helo.
Nothing has been there for a long time.	Ma jiraan wax halkaas muddo dheer.
It will even be better for you.	Xitaa way kuu fiicnaan doontaa.
I think that is enough today	Waxaan filayaa in taas maanta ku filan tahay
I have to go	Waa inaan aado
More time to make real money.	Waqti badan si aad lacag dhab ah u sameyso.
I will not talk to you again	Mar dambe kula hadli maayo
I tried to get him a job.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo isaga oo shaqo ah.
I was not able to do it.	Ma awoodin inaan sameeyo.
You are so.	Waxaad tahay sidaas.
The reason for this	Sababta loo joogo
It would be nice to learn.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in la barto.
No matter what he said.	Dhib malaha waxa uu yidhi.
I really felt bad for him saying that	Runtii aad ayaan uga dareemay isaga oo sidaas u sheegay
And still.	Oo weli.
That may not be the case now	Taas ma ahaan karo hadda
I wanted it there, I wanted it to stay	Waxaan ka rabay halkaas, waxaan rabay inay joogto
I didn’t get anything out of time	Ma helin wax aan waqti ahayn
I could not leave it that way	Waan uga tagi waayay sidaas
I need you to be here	waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaan joogto
Good when available.	Wanaagsan marka la helo.
I just have things to do	Kaliya waxaan hayaa waxyaabo aan sameeyo
I know it's not what you want to do	Waan ogahay inaysan ahayn waxaad rabto inaad sameyso
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samayn doono.

I am not one of them	Anigu ka mid ma ihi
She did not know.	Ma ay garanayn.
I want to go now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadda tago.
I really got it	Runtii waan helay
I am very happy now.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay hadda.
He will come.	Wuu iman doonaa.
People here.	Dadka halkan .
But you need to.	Laakiin waxaad u baahan tahay.
That may not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon karto.
They love me and they love each other.	Way i jecel yihiin oo way is jecel yihiin.
I decided to find and talk to her	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan helo oo aan la hadlo
It includes.	Waxaa ka mid ah.
I gave everything	Wax walba waan siiyay
I promise you	Waxaan ku ballan qaaday inaad
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel aad u qurux badan.
Here's how to do it	Waa kan sida loo sameeyo
I started again	Mar kale ayaan bilaabay

You can make a lot of money there.	Waxaad halkaas ka samayn kartaa lacag badan.
It doesn't go away much.	Wax badan kama baxo.

But he could not do anything.	Laakiin waxba ma uu samayn karin.
It should be kept at home.	Waa in lagu hayaa guriga.
I love it so much	Aad ayaan u jeclahay
That may be true.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa run.
It doesn't really look like it.	Wax dhab ah uma eka.
It will not stop.	Ma joojin doono.
I tried it at home	Guriga ayaan isku dayay
I felt at home.	Waxaan dareemay guriga.
Certainly not.	Run ahaantii maaha.
This was close.	Tani waxay ahayd mid dhow.

I hope to be like him one day	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqdo isaga oo kale maalin
I would really like to come back	Waxaan runtii jeclaan lahaa inaan soo noqdo
There was no other job.	Shaqo kale ma jirin.
But he was here.	Laakiin halkan ayuu joogay.
I can't see anything	Waxba ma arki karo
I looked at the door	Albaabka ayaan eegay
But that is what we do.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
You can do it here, now.	Waxaad ku samayn kartaa halkan, hadda.
I can't even speak.	Xitaa ma hadli karo.
It was like that.	Waxay ahayd sidaas oo kale.
I wish I could stay there longer	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas sii joogo waqti dheer
I wish I thought they would happen.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan u malaynayo inay dhici doonaan.
That will not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon doonto.
When he returned.	Markii uu ku soo noqday.
Just so beautiful.	Kaliya aad u qurux badan.
I want to get another one	Waxaan rabaa inaan helo mid kale
I know you are really	Waan ogahay waxaad tahay runtii
Would anyone tell me what to do?	Ma qof baa ii sheegi lahaa waxaan sameeyo.

I wanted to be like him	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo isaga oo kale
Made an amazing friend.	Sameeyay saaxiib yaab leh.
She said it was true and not false.	Waxay sheegtay waa run oo been maaha.
This is for sure.	Tani waa hubaal.
I told her she didn't have to do anything	Waxa aan u sheegay in aanay ahayn in ay wax samayso
Other things as well.	Waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
Something strange happened.	Wax yaab leh ayaa ku dhacay.
I don't care	Aniga waxba igama hayo
I did not know what he was doing	Ma garanayn waxa uu samaynayo
That is what you are here for.	Taasi waa waxa aad halkan u joogto.
I think they still exist	Waxaan filayaa inay wali jiraan
There is so much.	Waxaa jira aad u badan.
Same as.	Mid la mid ah.
I want to leave	Waxaan rabaa in laga tago
I will definitely take the room	Runtii qolka waan qaadan doonaa
I didn't think it would happen.	Uma malaynayn inay dhici doonto.

This could be me.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa aniga.
It can’t be hard.	Ma noqon karto mid adag.
And he still has enough.	Oo uu weli ku filan yahay.

I had to even go there	Waxay ahayd in aan xitaa halkaas tago
I do not see another.	Mid kale ma arko.
It may not be needed.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan loo baahnayn.
I will not do so tonight	Anigu sidaas yeeli maayo caawa
That didn't work.	Taas ma yeeli jirin.
I was amazed at how tall he was	Waxaan la yaabay sida uu u dheer yahay
This is why you are here today.	Tani waa sababta aad maanta halkan u joogto.
he will come.	wuu iman doonaa.
I am always the same	Had iyo jeer isku mid ayaan ahay
He did not understand very well.	Aad uma uu fahmin.
It is very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
I like to be surprised.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan la yaabay.
I think it may not have existed yet	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo in aanay weli jirin
We can't talk about what he did.	Ma ka hadli karno waxa uu sameeyay.
I did not think they would do this.	Uma malaynayn inay tan samayn doonaan.
That is the only reason.	Taasi waa sababta kaliya.
The latter returned in the same manner.	Kii dambe sidii oo kale ayuu ugu soo noqday.
I wanted to be part of it	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo
Maybe if not.	Malaha haddii aanu.
This may have been reported to me later.	Tan waxaa laga yaabaa in mar dambe la ii soo sheegay.
She lost everything.	Wax walba way wayday.
I can get out the front door	Waxaan ka bixi karaa albaabka hore
No one arrested me.	Qofna ima qaban.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I will just do more	Kaliya wax badan ayaan qaban doonaa
I expect that.	taas ayaan filayaa.
I can't do anything right	Wax sax ah ma samayn karo
That's what they do.	Taasi waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
I heard you, you know	Waan ku maqlay, waad ogtahay
Not sure	Ma hubo taas
I have no time for this	Waqti uma hayo arrintan
Hore.	Hore.
I should have told him earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego wakhti hore
But they are good.	Laakiin way fiican yihiin.
Soon enough again.	Mar dhow ku filan mar kale.
Most likely, they will never see him again.	Waxay u badan tahay, inay dib u arki doonin isaga.
And again and again.	Oo mar kale iyo mar kale.
I do it very much.	Aad ayaan u sameeyaa si aad u badan.
Nothing else works.	Wax kale ma shaqeeyo.
I did not do that.	Taas maan samayn.
It would pay more than enough before.	Waxay bixin lahayd inta badan ku filan ka hor.
This is even more so.	Tani way ka sii badan tahay.
He is definitely a man.	Dhab ahaantii waa nin.
But you know, who knows.	Laakiin waad ogtahay, yaa yaqaan.
I think we can see great things in him	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan isaga wax weyn ka arki karno
I do, but this is very difficult	Waan sameeyaa, laakiin tani aad bay u adag tahay
He came back.	Dib ayuu ugu soo noqday.
I think I will do it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan sameyn doono
It was a difficult time for everyone.	Waxay ahayd wakhti adag qof walba.
I did it without telling anyone	Aniga oo aan cidna u sheegin ayaan sameeyay
I wanted you to know everything	Waxaan rabay inaad wax walba ogaato
I wanted to be friends again	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale saaxiibo la noqdo
I wonder how it really feels to me	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida uu runtii aniga ii dareemayo
But here I was surprised.	Laakiin halkan waxaan la yaabay.
I wanted to know what and why and how	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa iyo sababta iyo sida
I can tell you this.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa tan.
I didn't have to go in person.	Ma ahayn inaan qof ahaan u tago.
I hope he is not in trouble	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan wax dhibaato ah ku jirin
,	,
I did not have a job to go to	Maan haysan shaqo aan aado
I liked it when it came out	Waan ka helay markii uu soo baxay
Everything is fine so far.	Wax walba waa ku fiican yihiin ilaa halkan.
I thought it might be interesting	Waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon karto mid xiiso leh
You know that.	Aniga taas waad ogtahay.
It should not have.	Ma ahayn inay.
I could not find it anywhere	Meel u dhow ma aan heli karin
That is true to me.	Taasi run bay ila tahay.
He thought it was very good.	Wuxuu mooday inay aad u wanaagsan tahay.
I did not know anyone	Cidna maan garanayn
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
That will help.	Taasi waxay ku caawin doontaa.
It was not too difficult.	Ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
It really may not come back until tomorrow.	Run ahaantii waxa laga yaabaa in aanay ku soo noqon ilaa berri.
I should have told you	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu sheego
I have looked before.	Hore ayaan u eegay.
He says, he really does.	Wuu leeyahay, runtii wuu leeyahay.
But close enough.	Laakiin ku filan dhow.
I will not do that again, you know that	Mar dambe ma yeeli doono taas, waad ogtahay taas
He really does not know me.	Runtii ima garanayo.
I love working from home as well	Waxaan jeclahay inaan ka shaqeeyo guriga sidoo kale
In fact, it will certainly speak for itself.	Runtii, hubaal way iska hadli doontaa.
I wanted to see.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko.
I had no money.	Lacag ma haysan.
A little better.	Wax yar ka wanaagsan.
I have other things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo kale oo aad sameyso.
I hope this does not take long	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani aysan qaadan doonin waqti dheer
In fact, this is not true.	Dhab ahaantii, tani run maaha.
He knew he would get one more chance.	Wuxuu ogaa inuu hal fursad oo kale heli doono.
I had nowhere to go	Meel aan aado maan haysan
But it is not the only thing.	Laakiin ma aha oo kaliya wax.
It is always the same.	Had iyo jeer waa isku mid.
I knew what it was	Waan ogaa waxa ay tahay
It can't happen now.	Ma dhici karto hadda.
I could not leave	Waan ka tagi waayay
But that's fine.	Laakiin taasi way fiican tahay.
I think there is more.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax badan jiraan.
I do not have.	Ma haysto.
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
After a while.	Muddo ka dib.
so I got it.	sidaas ayaan ku helay.
Now I got it.	Hadda waan helay.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
I have not yet been able to eat	Wali ma awoodin inaan wax cuno
I just did not know what it was	Kaliya maan garanayn waxa ay tahay
Everything should be new there.	Wax walba waa inay ku cusub yihiin halkaas hadda.
Do not stop until they do.	Ha joojin ilaa ay sameeyaan.
I wondered what he would do	Waxa aan is waydiiyay waxa uu samayn doono
I can see	waan arki karaa
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
I can clearly see that	Waxaan si fiican u arki karaa taas
That was great for me	Aniga taasi aad bay ii ahayd
That's right	Waa sax
He would not say so.	Ma uu odhan lahaa sidaas.
That would take time, but it didn’t feel any immediate.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti, laakiin ma uu dareemay wax degdeg ah.
I had an amazing day.	Waxaan lahaa maalin yaab leh.
I went back and said so	Dib baan ugu noqday oo sidaas u sheegay
He will be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
I'm back now.	Dib ayaan u aaday hadda.
She is still fine.	Weli way wanaagsan tahay.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
I can do that already	Mar hore ayaan taas samayn karaa
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
I just can't do this anymore	Kaliya tan ma sameyn karo mar dambe
I want to know if he will be fine	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado inuu fiicnaan doono
I could be home late	Waxaan noqon karaa guriga goor dambe
I need your help	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad wax iga caawiso
That could be him alone.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa isaga oo kaliya.
I couldn’t imagine what he would do.	Ma malayn karin waxa uu samayn doono.
I know it's hard	Waan ogahay inay adag tahay
She would do it.	Way samayn lahayd.
But that was what she said.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxay tidhi.
It was constant.	Waxay ahayd mid joogto ah.
I'm so sorry to keep you.	Aad baan uga xumahay inaan ku sii hayo.
I really can't help it	Runtii ma caawin karo
It's the same for me.	Waa isku mid aniga.
I was not there much	In badan ma aan joogin halkaas
I think she said she did not know him	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay tidhi ma aysan garanayn isaga
This is what we need.	Tani waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan ayaa dhacay.
It will tell you everything you need to know.	Wuxuu kuu sheegi doonaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
She does not have to do that.	Ma aha inay sidaas samayso.
Maybe I should buy it in advance	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ka hor iibsado
It is a lie.	Waa been.
I wondered where everyone was	Waxaan la yaabay meesha qof walba joogo
The location is unknown.	Lama garanayo meesha.
I still don't know.	Wali ma garanayo.
It was not there again.	Mar kale ma jirin.
I need you to be there for me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaas ii joogto
I know it was.	Waan ogahay inay ahayd.
Maybe I should do it somewhere else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan meel kale ku sameeyo.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin maaha mid kan.
I can't be smart	Ma noqon karo caqli badan
I can give you more	Wax badan baan ku siin karaa
Go somewhere else.	Meel kale aado.
That is not true.	Runtii taasi run maaha.
No more problems.	Dhib dambe ma leh.
I would go again.	Mar kale tagi lahaa.
I am at home with a friend.	Waxaan joogaa guriga saaxiib.
It will come.	Way iman doontaa.
I have been away for a very long time	Waxaan tagay wakhti aad u dheer
There are so many of us.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo naga mid ah.
I would like	waan jeclaan lahaa
He got it.	Wuu helay.
I can not imagine.	Ma malayn karo.
No one wants to talk about it.	Qofna ma rabo inuu ka hadlo.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doono.
He left me.	Wuu ii baxay.
You	Adiga
I really don’t like it.	Dhab ahaantii ma jecla.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
I dont understand	Maan fahmin
I just couldn't tell.	Kaliya waan sheegi waayay.
I know there is nothing better	Waan ogahay in aysan jirin wax ka fiican
It is the same.	Waa isku mid.
He always said something.	Mar walba wax buu odhan jiray.
He looked at it quickly.	Degdeg buu u eegay.
I had never thought of this before	Mar hore uma malaynayn tan
I really do, you know.	Runtii waan sameeyaa, waad ogtahay.
You will see.	Waad arki doontaa.
I know this is hard for you.	Waan ogahay in tani ay kugu adag tahay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta ay.
I think she had.	Waxaan filayaa inay lahayd.
I think she likes you	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ku jeceshahay
There is something new.	Wax cusub ayaa jira.
I knew there was something	Waan ogaa in ay wax jiraan
But they will not succeed.	Laakiin ma guulaysan doonaan.
I wanted to say something about it.	Waxa aan rabay in aan wax ka sheego.
You are for me.	Adiga ayaa ii ah.
Every moment will come now.	Wakhti kasta hadda way iman doontaa.
I see no problem in that	Wax dhib ah uma arko taas
I did not see one coming	Maan arag mid soo socda
It includes.	Waxaa ka mid ah.
I'm sure you would like.	Waan hubaa inaad jeclaan lahayd.
told me that.	ii sheegay taas.
I think it will take some time	Waxaan filayaa inay qaadan doonto wakhti
I love everyone.	Waan jeclahay qof walba.
First, how they are.	Marka hore, sida waxa ay yihiin.
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
Maybe that's enough.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku filan tahay.
I just can't take this	Kaliya ma qaadan karo kan
I thought you would stay	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad sii joogi doonto
A lot of money came in.	Waxaa meesha soo galay lacag badan.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
That will really help.	Taasi runtii way caawin doontaa.
I have not seen it yet	Wali ma arag
I would like to know where it is now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado halka ay hadda tahay
I think this.	Waxaan qabaa tan.
I decided not to do it.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan ku qaban.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa.
You can get what you need.	Waxaad heli kartaa waxaad u baahan tahay.
I can always find someone more ready	Had iyo jeer waxaan heli karaa qof ka sii diyaar ah
You will be fine, he said.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa, ayuu yidhi.
We should not need anyone	Waa inaan cidna u baahnayn
Maybe someone was there.	Malaha qof baa meesha joogay.
I would love to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo
That did not understand him.	Taasi ma fahmin isaga.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
Like, a lot more.	Sida, wax badan oo badan.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
And maybe that was true.	Oo malaha taasi run bay ahayd.
I can't stop.	Ma joojin karo.
I do not know how she did it	Ma garanayo sida ay u samaysay
I really want to be this one	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo kan
He had things to do.	Wuxuu lahaa waxyaabo uu sameeyo.
Clever is not beautiful, it is not beautiful.	Caqli leh ma qurux badna, ma qurux badna.
I started to learn everything	Waxaan bilaabay inaan wax walba barto
Much the same.	In badan oo isku mid ah.
It was too fast and too fast	Waxay ahayd mid aad u degdeg badan oo degdeg ah
To find out this.	Si loo ogaado tan.
I had a busy day	Waxaan lahaa maalin mashquul ah
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
They did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
I got that.	Waan helay taas.
Probably a long time ago.	Malaha wakhti dheer.
He left the previous day.	Maalin hore ayuu ka tagay.
A big man could not find it	Nin weyn ayaa heli waayay
This is all he needs.	Tani waa waxa kaliya ee uu u baahan yahay.
I really wanted to leave.	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
I would just like to see what it looks like.	Waxaan kaliya jeclaan lahaa inaan arko sida ay u egtahay.
It could not happen to a friend like you	Ma dhici karin saaxiib adiga oo kale ah
I hope we can stay, ”he said	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan sii joogi karno ayuu yiri
I can not do the latter	Tan dambe ma samayn karo
I have no idea what it might be	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxay noqon karto
He could not see much.	Wax badan ma uu arki karin.
You are having a great time.	Waxaad tahay waqti weyn.
Not over.	Aan dhammaan.
I did not want to make money	Maan doonayn in aan lacag helo
More than you.	In ka badan adiga.
I can't help it, it's too bad.	Ma caawin karo, aad buu u xun yahay.
I am always with you	Mar walba waan kula joogaa
In fact, it is a lie.	Runtii, waa been.
I am ready for it.	diyaar ayaan u ahay .
I can't believe you don't have it	Ma rumaysan karo inaadan haysan
I never believed that.	Weligay taas ma rumaysan.
You and I, we are who we are.	Aniga iyo adiga, waxaan nahay waxaan nahay.
I will do nothing less.	Wax ka yar ma qaban doono.
I really didn't think you were serious before	Runtii uma malaynayn inaad dhab ka tahay hadda ka hor
I turned away from him	Waan ka noqday isaga
It has a problem.	Dhib buu leeyahay.
After a while	Wax yar ka dib
I think we can get you everything you need	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan ku heli karno wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay
You can do this, you know.	Waad samayn kartaa tan, waad ogtahay.
But he thought it might help.	Laakiin wuxuu u maleeyay inay ku caawin karto.
I can do whatever is needed	Waxaan samayn karaa wax kasta oo loo baahan yahay
I knew they were not coming for me	Waan ogaa inaysan ii iman
I knew we could see it now	Waan ogaa inaan hadda arki karno
I did not give him time.	Waqti ma siin isaga.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I was the same	Si la mid ah ayaan ahaa
He did not do well.	Si fiican uma uu qaban.
I could not say anything	Waxba waan u sheegi waayay
I know, you would be fine	Waan ogahay, waad fiicnaan lahayd
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
Three one, he is good at this.	Saddex hal, wuu ku fiican yahay kan.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
No one can say this.	Qofna ma sheegi karo tan.
I have to do the same	Waa inaan sidoo kale sameeyo
It is definitely an old problem.	Hubaal waa dhibaato hore.
It will not be any better here.	Ma noqon doonto wax ka wanaagsan halkan.
He can do whatever he wants.	Waxa uu rabo wuu samayn karaa.
I am a bad person	waxaan ahay qof xun
I had to put it in place	Waxa ay ahayd in aan meel ku dhigay
It should also.	Sidoo kale waa inay.
I know there are a lot of them	Waan ogahay inay wax badan ka jiraan
He was a very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u wanaagsan.
You really can't win.	Runtii ma guulaysan kartid.
That was not surprising.	Taasi ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I don't know what it will be, but there must be something.	Ma garanayo waxay noqon doonto, laakiin waa inay wax jiraan.
I heard you are at home	Waxaan maqlay inaad guriga joogto
Maybe that was true.	Malaha taasi run bay ahayd.
It belongs to a man.	Nin baa leh.
It's a bit like that.	Waa xoogaa sidaas oo kale ah.
I have no idea how I work	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sida aan u shaqeeyo
I hope you still love me	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad weli i jeceshahay
I know what she wants to do	Waan ogahay waxay rabto inay sameyso
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
I got a lot from this	Wax badan ayaan ka helay tan
Which is really nice.	Taas oo runtii fiican.
I did not find anyone	Qofna maan helin
I really hope it was the latter	Waxaan si dhab ah u rajeynayaa inay ahayd tan dambe
you are amazing.	yaab baad tahay.
I saw that this would be as it was	Waxaan arkay in tani ay noqon doonto sida ay ahayd
He looked at another.	Mid kale ayuu eegay.
I will not see him again.	Mar dambe ma arko.
I have to be happy.	Waa inaan faraxsanahay.
I am a new person	Waxaan ahay qof cusub
he would do it.	wuu samayn lahaa.
I still know.	Wali waan ogahay.
I have not found a job for more than a year	Wax shaqo ah maan helin in ka badan hal sano
Are there any jobs?	Wax shaqo ah ma jiraan?.
I know you do not believe me.	Waan ogahay inaadan i rumaysan.
This is so beautiful.	Tani waa mid aad u qurux badan.
I just got it	Kaliya waan helay
I would do anything to get it back.	Wax walba waan sameyn lahaa si aan dib ugu helo.
No other problem.	Dhib kale ma jiro.
I just fell for it	Kaliya waan ku dhacay
I would say the same	Mid la mid ah ayaan ku odhan lahaa
Too much work too little money.	Shaqo aad u badan lacag aad u yar.
Really a lot.	Runtii wax badan.
I was amazed at how much he knew	Waxa aan la yaabay inta uu garanayo
It's something to me.	Wax bay aniga ila tahay.
It is said that someone is still in the house.	Waxaa la sheegay in qof weli ku jiro guriga.
I told him what had happened	Waxaan u sheegay waxa dhacay
I did not want to lie	Ma rabin inaan been sheego
It can't be anything else.	Wax kale ma noqon karto.
I saw but he did not see me	Waan arkay laakiin ima uu arag
How beautiful she is.	Sidee u qurux badan tahay.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
I am now myself.	Aniga hadda aniga ayaan ahay.
It can be seen.	Waa la arki karaa.
But there is nothing to do	Laakiin ma jiraan wax la sameeyo
I really wanted to	Aad ayaan u rabay
Say you are in it	Sheeg inaad ku jirto
I'll tell you how it is.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa sida ay tahay.
I will never see him again	Mar dambe ma arki doono isaga
It came out.	Waa la soo baxay.
I can see things differently	Si kale ayaan wax u arki karaa
I got nothing	Waxba waan helay
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
I was the one who did not understand	Waxaan ahaa kii aan fahmin
I had to talk to her	Waxay ahayd inaan la hadlo
You know, very difficult.	Waad ogtahay, aad u adag.
He is still a friend.	Wali waa saaxiib.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan ayaa dhacay.
I just wanted to see how it is	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan arko sida ay tahay
I think you said so	Waxaan filayaa inaad sidaas tidhi
I was even surprised he wanted me	Waxaan xitaa la yaabay inuu i rabo
I can help you with that	Taas waan kaa caawin karaa
I am not there yet.	Wali maan joogin.
We are now.	Waxaan hadda nahay.
I said nothing else	Wax kale ma odhan
There must be more than that.	Waa in ay jiraan wax ka badan taas.
What he heard he could not believe.	Waxa uu maqlay waa uu rumaysan waayay.
I can see everything here.	Wax walba halkan ayaan ka arki karaa.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
He could not do anything better.	Wax fiican ma uu qaban karin.
You know that as well as everyone.	Waad ogtahay taas iyo sidoo kale qof kasta.
No one said anything	Cidna waxba uma sheegin
I never wanted to do that.	Weligay ma rabin inaan taas sameeyo.
I told her it could happen anywhere	Waxaan u sheegay in ay dhici karto meel kasta
I don't understand how it is.	Waxba ma fahmin sida ay tahay.
I did not know.	Maan garanayn.
Good, another said.	Fiican, mid kale ayaa yidhi.
I think she is a good friend of yours	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay saaxiib wanaagsan adiga
And, it was.	Oo, waxay ahayd.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
You will leave in a few years.	Waxaad bixi doontaa dhowr sano.
I know you would like it to be different.	Waan ogahay inaad jeclaan lahayd inay si kale noqon karto.
But it was so beautiful.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
Not here.	Ma aha halkan.
There was no other place for food.	Ma jirin meel kale oo cunto ah.
But nothing can be done.	Laakiin waxba lama qaban karo.
So far, it can't be done.	Ilaa hadda, lama samayn karo.
Maybe I should go home	Malaha waa inaan aado guriga
I have no idea who she was	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo cidda ay ahayd
This will take.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa.
I thought he knew	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ogaado
Now we are friends.	Hadda waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
He had to help me.	Waxay ahayd inuu i caawiyo.
A lot	Wax badan
I just need to do something for you	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan adiga wax ku sameeyo
He should not have spoken.	Ma ahayn inuu hadlo.
I have been holding it for a long time.	Waxaan hayaa muddo dheer.
I can go anywhere there	Meel kasta waan ka tagi karaa halkaas
I have never been to one before	Weligay mid hore uma joogin
I'll get one soon.	Waxaan ku heli doonaa mid mar dhow.
But now you are something else.	Laakiin hadda waxaad tahay wax kale.
Do not believe the past.	Ha rumaysan wixii tagay.
I would come again	Mar kale ayaan iman lahaa
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
Not just one day.	Hal maalin kaliya maaha.
That's right for me.	Waa iga sax.
We will have.	Waanu haysan doonaa.
You were very tough.	Waxaad ahayd mid aad u adag.
As you already have.	Sida aad hore u lahayd.
I wanted to know what he was doing	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa uu samaynayo
This is one of them.	Tani waa mid ka mid ah.
I doubt they are true	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay run yihiin
I wanted to know what happened to her	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa ku dhacay
I probably would have done the same	Waxaan u badan tahay inaan samayn lahaa wax la mid ah
I'm just happy.	Kaliya waan faraxsanahay.
I can't believe you are	Ma rumaysan karo inaad tahay
Maybe I did.	Malaha waan sameeyay.
This is really good.	Runtii tani waa wanaagsan tahay.
It may still be.	Wali waa laga yaabaa.
Today someone is me.	Maanta qof waa aniga.
I know it will be fine	Waan ogahay inay fiicnaan doonto
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
I couldn't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karin.
Maybe I should go	Malaha waa inaan tago
Maybe not.	Ma laga yaabaa.
I have never told anyone that	Weligay qof sidaas uma sheegin
I still love you so much	Wali aad ayaan kuu jeclahay
This was something else.	Tani waxay ahayd wax kale.
He had no idea he was like that	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inuu sidaas yahay
I want to know the rest, too.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado inta kale, sidoo kale.
There were several others.	Waxaa jiray dhowr kale.
I pretended she did	Waxaan iska dhigay in ay samaysay
I knew that would happen	Waan ogaa in taasi dhici doonto
And even better.	Oo ka sii fiican.
I wish there was something we could do	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay jiraan wax aan sameyn karno
I love you for everything	Wax walba waan ku jeclahay
They must be helped	Waa in la caawiyo
He really didn't say much.	Runtii aad uma uu odhan.
Probably, maybe.	Waxay u badan tahay, malaha.
We can't find anything else.	Wax kale ma heli karno.
But I can't do it.	Laakiin ma samayn karo.
Another would have ended.	Mid kale way dhammaan lahayd.
I told him you were not ready	Waxaan u sheegay in aadan diyaar u ahayn
We can't leave him there.	Ma uga tagi karno isaga halkaas.
Very large.	Aad u weyn.
I always wanted to stay with him	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan isaga la sii joogo
I should have done this a long time ago	Waxay ahayd inaan tan sameeyo waa hore
But no one says you can't do this.	Laakiin qofna ma odhan ma samayn kartid tan.
I just have to go somewhere else	Kaliya waa inaan aado meel kale
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
What a man.	Waa maxay nin.
I would like to know	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado
I can't let you do that	Ma ogolaan karo inaad taas samayso
Everything is correct.	Wax walba waa sax.
That's bad enough.	Taasi waa wax xun oo ku filan.
It may not be something that everyone has.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn wax qof walba leeyahay.
It needs if.	Waxay u baahan tahay haddii.
I have to get to know him better	Waa inaan si fiican u barto isaga
You said you would.	Waxaad sheegtay in aad sameyn doonto.
That is if he is alive.	Taasi waa haddii uu nool yahay.
This was a lie of what was done.	Tani waxay ahayd been wixii la sameeyay.
I even came back with one.	Xitaa mid ayaan soo noqday.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan hadda tago.
He could not believe it.	Wuu rumaysan waayay.
I tried to talk about it	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ka hadlo
I will be whatever you want me to be	Waxaan noqon doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto inaan noqdo
I heard someone say.	Waxaan maqlay qof leh.
I know you really like him	Waan ogahay inaad runtii isaga jeceshahay
I know you do not know.	Waan ogahay inaadan garanayn.
I have no idea how much	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto ilaa inta
That is not the case.	Taasi sidaas maaha.
I made a promise to you	Ballan baan kuu qaaday
I love that they love me	Waxaan jeclahay inay i jecel yihiin
I think it was right	Waxaan filayaa inay sax ahayd
I am very happy about that	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas
I just want to be with you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo
After a while everyone did.	Wax yar ka dib qof kastaa wuu sameeyay.
Don't talk to me again.	Mar dambe ha ila hadlin.
Much of this is being kept	Wax badan oo taas ka mid ah waa la hayaa
I like to tell people	Waxaan jeclahay in aan dadka u sheego
I did not come here to find a man	Halkan uma iman inaan nin helo
I could not believe what he was saying now	Waan rumaysan waayay waxa uu hadda yidhi
I have heard a lot, let me tell you	Wax badan ayaan maqlay, aan kuu sheego
See you soon	Waan ku arki doonaa maalin dhow
I want to stay with you for a long time	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula sii joogo waqti dheer
We were the only people here.	Waxaan ahayn dadka kaliya ee halkan.
I would do it.	Waan samayn lahaa.
I would stop him.	waan joojin lahaa isaga.
I made it to work today.	Waxaan sameeyay inaan shaqeeyo maanta.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
It just has to.	Kaliya waa inay.
Nothing at first.	Waxba marka hore.
Probably three times.	Malaha saddex jeer.
I wanted everything he could give me.	Waxaan rabay wax kasta oo uu i siin karo.
Much really, just no one really	Wax badan run ahaantii, kaliya ma jiro qof dhab ah
I can really say that	Runtii taas waan ka sheegi karaa
It was a beautiful little place.	Waxay ahayd meel yar oo qurux badan.
I wonder when someone loves me.	Waxaan la yaabanahay marka qof i jecel yahay.
But there is still time.	Laakiin weli waqti ayaa jira.
Now I am not sure why	Hadda ma hubo sababta
I hope you will be fine	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
Just that I am not ready yet	Kaliya taas weli diyaar uma ihi
Good people there.	Dadka si fiican halkaas.
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
New things will come out.	Waxyaabo cusub ayaa soo bixi doona.
That's how they do it.	Waa sida ay sameeyaan.
I'm sure they won't be surprised.	Waxaan hubaa inaysan la yaab ku noqon doonin.
I'm really sorry for what happened to you	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay waxa kugu dhacay
Maybe you too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale.
I knew she would get there.	Waan ogaa inay halkaas ka heli doonto.
I don't want anyone else	Ma doonayo qof kale
I just want to be left alone	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in la iga tago
This is a great place.	Tani waa meel aad u fiican.
I have nowhere to go	Meel aan ka tago ma hayo
Maybe that was it.	Malaha taasi waxay ahayd.
I may not be ready, but he was	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan diyaar u ahayn, laakiin wuu ahaa
It's time to pay.	Waa markii aan bixin lahaa.
I just want to talk to you.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo.
I saw everything.	Wax walba waan arkay.
He said he did not know.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu garanayn.
It felt long	Waxa la dareemay dheer
I know you know that.	Waan ogahay in aad taas ogtahay.
That will be.	Taasi waxay ahaan doontaa.
I wanted to be there.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas joogo.
They do not exist today.	Maanta ma jiraan.
This is not how it is.	Tani maaha sida ay tahay.
It should have been.	Waxay ahayd inay ahayd.
There is so much here.	Wax badan ayaa jira halkan.
I think that would be great.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd.
He is a very good person.	Runtii waa qof aad u fiican.
Not me.	Aniga ma aha.
Just don't let anyone see you.	Kaliya ha u ogolaan qof inuu ku arko.
I didn't have to work	Ma ahayn inaan shaqeeyo
I just didn't want to talk about it	Kaliya ma rabin inaan ka hadlo
You said.	Waad tidhi.
That should be enough for now.	Taasi waa inay ku filan tahay hadda.
I did not find a place to go	Maan arag meel aan tago
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
A tall adult	Qof weyn oo dheer
You will see much more of us.	Wax badan oo kale ayaad naga arki doontaa.
You get an idea of ​​what happened.	Waxaad ka heli fikrad ah waxa dhacay.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
I know what you are.	Waan ogahay waxaad tahay.
I have not seen.	Maan arag.
It requires a lot of work.	Waxay u baahan tahay shaqo badan.

And everything else.	Iyo wax kasta oo kale.
I can clearly see	Si cad ayaan u arki karaa
I'm so sorry to say	Aad baan uga xumahay inaan sheego
He will stay home tomorrow.	Berri ayuu guriga joogi doonaa.
I have no problem today	Wax dhib ah igama haysto maanta
Not just me, but you.	Aniga kaliya maaha, laakiin adiga.
Not sure, indeed	Ma hubo, runtii
You will see why, soon.	Waad arki doontaa sababta, goor dhow.
I need to know that	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan taas ogaado
I did not give much	In badan maan siin
I have to do this from time to time	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa mar mar
It may not end there, but it will be fine.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay u dhammaan, laakiin way fiicnaan doontaa.
I know you all want me	Waan ogahay inaad dhammaan i rabto
But they will come.	Laakiin way iman doonaan.
I have always been very	Had iyo jeer aad baan u ahaa
I tried to do the right thing	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sameeyo wax sax ah
That is true.	Taas ayaa run lagu sheegay.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
I think it's a good thing and a bad thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay wax wanaagsan oo xun.
I love you so much, so much	waan ku jeclahay si, aad iyo aad
I know you were a good friend	Waan ogahay inaad ahayd saaxiib wanaagsan
He is like a man.	Waa sida nin oo kale.
I love everything about it	Waan jeclahay wax kasta oo ka mid ah
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
You would like to know.	Waxaad jeclaan lahayd inaad ogaato.
I do it every day.	Waxaan sameeyaa maalin kasta.
Most of the house as well.	Inta badan guriga sidoo kale.
I can only talk to him but nothing else.	Kaliya waan la hadli karaa isaga laakiin wax kale ma jiro.
I just need to know why he doesn’t like me.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta uusan ii jeclayn.
I did not take anything seriously	Wax dhab ah uma qaadan
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
I am very sorry about that.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas.
I just didn’t want to know anything about it.	Kaliya ma rabin inaan wax ka ogaado.
Lots of money to spend	Lacag badan oo lagu qaado
One will be for you.	Mid ayaa adiga kuu ahaan doona.
I knew you wanted me	Waan ogaa inaad i rabto
He told her.	Ayuu u sheegay.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa.
Really amazing.	Runtii aad u yaab badan.
And a hard place.	Iyo meel adag.
Maybe too long.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u dheer.
That is what I will do here.	Taasi waa waxa aan ku sameyn doono halkan.
It is very likely that.	Aad bay ugu badan tahay inay.
But one has.	Laakiin mid ayaa leh.
I found a good man	Waxaan helay nin wanaagsan
I had to buy it all	Waxay ahayd inaan wada iibsado
I did not know what would happen to him.	Ma garanayn waxa ku dhici doona.
Maybe just like you	Malaha adiga oo kale
I couldn’t believe how bad it was	Ma rumaysan karin sida ay u xun tahay
I would definitely not stay there again.	Dhab ahaan ma sii joogi lahaa halkaas mar kale.
I will tell you soon	Dhawaan ayaan u sheegi doonaa
I think it is the same for me and him.	Waxaan filayaa inay aniga iyo isaga la mid tahay.
Don't tell me what to do.	Ha ii sheegin waxaan sameeyo.
It was work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo.
But he said.	Laakiin wuu yidhi.
He was a very big man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u badan.
I never knew who they were	Weligay maan garanayn cidda ay yihiin
I got out of it quickly	Degdeg ayaan uga soo baxay
I really don't like who you are.	Runtii ma jecli qofka aad tahay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I am very happy	Waxaan aad ugu faraxsanahay
I can't say what it was.	Ma sheegi karo waxay ahayd.
But today he had.	Laakiin maanta wuu lahaa.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
I told him how he could do better.	Waxaan u sheegay sida uu si ka wanaagsan u samayn karo.
Tell her how it was.	U sheeg sidii ay ahayd.
It will be great	Waxay noqon doontaa weyn
It was here.	Waxay ahayd halkan.
He is really good.	Runtii wuu fiican yahay.
It will be the same for everyone, I think.	Waxay la mid noqon doontaa qof kasta, waxaan qabaa.
And there is some truth to that.	Oo waxaa jira xoogaa run ah taas.
But he was obviously surprised.	Laakiin waxa iska cad in uu la yaabay.
I think it would be better to stay on a regular basis	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan lahayd in si joogto ah loo sii joogo
Not me.	Ma aha aniga.
It’s all she knows.	Waa wax kasta oo ay ogtahay.
I went here three years ago	Waxaan halkan tagay saddex sano ka hor
I thought it might help	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ku caawin karto
You need to know what you are doing and why.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxaad samaynayso iyo sababta.
Otherwise, it is not.	Haddii kale, ma aha.
I think everyone feels the same way	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu dareemayo sidaas oo kale
That would be great.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax weyn.
I know she is there	Waan ogahay inay halkaas ku jirto
There is nothing else to say.	Wax kale oo la sheego ma jiraan.
I do not know where to go from here.	Ma garanayo meel aan ka tago halkan.
But he knew enough.	Laakiin wuu ogaa in ku filan.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
I want to know who she is	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado qofka ay tahay
I can't help it if you won't let me	Kuma caawin karo haddii aadan i ogolaan doonin
So known.	Sidaas la yaqaan.
I need you to be here now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkan joogto hadda
I have told him many more as well	Wax badan oo kale ayaan u sheegay sidoo kale
No problem yet.	Weli dhib kama ay soo bixin.
You know they will be there.	Waad ogtahay inay halkaas joogi doonaan.
It will not be worse than that.	Ma noqon doonto wax ka xun taas.
I don't want to see this, ever	Ma rabo inaan tan arko, weligay
are you	ma tahay
I told them they had no chance	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay fursad u helin
It is so beautifully made	Si aad u qurux badan ayaa loo sameeyay
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
I looked and said nothing	Aniga oo aan waxba odhan ayaan eegay
I have never seen one before	Weligay mid hore uma arag
You can say that.	Waad sheegi kartaa taas.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
For the most part, that is enough.	Inta badan, taasi waa ku filan tahay.
Everyone is very visible.	Qof walba aad buu u muuqdaa.
I asked her if she liked it	Waxaan waydiiyay inay jeceshahay iyo in kale
I can do it most of the time	Waan samayn karaa inta badan
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
One day, no problem	Maalin, dhib la'aan
I think he is a good man	Waxaan filayaa inuu yahay nin wanaagsan
This will end soon.	Tani mar dhow way dhammaan doontaa.
I am like him.	Waxaan ahay isaga oo kale.
He can do anything.	Wax walba wuu samayn karaa.
I love being friends	Waxaan jeclahay inaan saaxiibo
I tried to help	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo
He had another reason.	Sababta kale ayuu u lahaa.
I knew it would happen when he could	Waan ogaa inuu dhici doono marka uu awoodo
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
I am really happy for him.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga.
I can do a lot	Wax badan ayaan qaban karaa
But he knows nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma yaqaan.
No one wanted to know	Qofna ma rabin inuu ogaado
I have nothing to do	Wax aan sameeyo ma hayo
There was little to do here.	Waxaa jiray wax yar oo halkan lagu sameeyo.
I have a lot to say	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan sheego
I look like someone else now.	Waxaan la mid ahay qof kale hadda.
I know this is the best thing for me	Waan ogahay inay tani ii tahay waxa ugu fiican
I am not as small as they are	Ma ihi mid aad u yar sida ay yihiin
I found it there	Halkaas ayaan uga helay
It can't be done	Lama samayn karo
He turned his back on me.	Dib ayuu igu noqday.
Which is nice, obviously.	Taas oo fiican, iska cad.
ah	ah
I suspect they exist.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay jiraan.
And he left there.	Oo halkaas uga tagay.
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
Both are me.	Labaduba waa aniga.
After all, he wasn’t.	Ka dib, ma uusan ahayn.
I have never seen it that way	Weligay sidaas uma arag
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid iska cad.
I can't do anything else	Wax kale ma samayn karo
I know very well that he did	Waxaan si fiican u garanayaa inuu sameeyay
He is not a good man.	Ma aha nin wanaagsan.
I bought it	waan iibsaday
I think you did the right thing.	Waxaan filayaa inaad samaysay wax sax ah.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
It really is nothing new.	Runtii maaha wax cusub.
They live here.	Waxay ku nool yihiin halkan.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
He knew very well.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
We would have had everything right.	Wax walba si sax ah ayaan u haysan lahayn.
And, how much.	Iyo, inta.
Much better.	Si aad u badan ayaa ka wanaagsan.
I look forward to seeing you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko
Just take it.	Kaliya qaado.
There is not much I can do about that.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo aan taas ka qaban karo.
He did not say where he went.	Ma uusan sheegin meesha uu u baxay.
It's me again.	Waa aniga mar kale.
They are happy.	Way ku faraxsan yihiin.
I really don't care.	Runtii waxba igama qabo.
I have a lot	Wax badan baan hayaa
I tried to find it.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo.
It will take a long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti dheer.
Also now.	Sidoo kale hadda.
He says it is done.	Waxa uu yidhi waa la sameeyaa.
I can hardly even see it at home	Si dhib ah xitaa guriga uma arki karo
Very long.	Aad u dheer.
That's why you didn't see it.	Waa sababta aad u arki weyday.
Everything was in place.	Wax walba meel bay ahayd.
It is not beautiful.	Qurux maaha.
She was smart.	Waxay lahayd caqli fiican.
Nothing to do with it	Wax aan waxba ka samayn
I am not someone you want to know.	Ma ihi qof aad rabto inaad ogaato.
I went a lot	Aad baan u baxay
In addition to now.	Marka laga soo tago hadda.
I'm glad she's here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay halkan joogto
We will tell you what we do.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa aan samayno.
No one could believe it.	Qofna ma rumaysan karin.
No one is in the room.	Qofna ma joogo qolka.
Like if you don't get enough.	Sida haddii aadan helin wax kugu filan.
It should not take long, but who knows.	Waa inaysan qaadan waqti dheer, laakiin yaa yaqaan.
He never liked it.	Waligiis ma jeclayn.
One day, gone.	Maalin, tagay.
I do this all the time	Waxaan tan sameeyaa mar kasta
Certainly it was one.	Waxa hubaal ah in ay ahayd mid.
I didn’t want to be any more	Ma aanan rabin inaan noqdo mid kale oo badan
I really wanted to do it	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo
I did not know who she was	Maan garanayn cidda ay tahay
He could not believe what had happened.	Waxa dhacay wuu rumaysan waayay.
Nothing came without a hitch.	Waxba ma iman dhib la'aan.
I will not talk to anyone	Cidna la hadli maayo
I had to do that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas sameeyo
I have seen this before.	Tan hore ayaan u arkay.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
There was nothing that no one wanted.	Ma jirin wax qof uusan rabin.
I am happy for you here	Waan ku faraxsanahay halkan adiga
I have never been one	Weligay mid ma joogin
See yourself at work now.	Hadda isku arag shaqada.
I have not been here before	Hadda ka hor ma aan joogin halkan
I could not have imagined anything better	Wax ka fiican maan malayn karin
I left nothing.	Waxba kama tagin.
This was.	Tani waxay ahayd.
We can not help.	Ma caawin karno.
I can see him a little better	Waan arki karaa isaga oo ka yara fiican
As such.	Sida oo kale.
He said she was a good friend.	Wuxuu sheegay inay ahayd saaxiib wanaagsan.
I think she really does	Waxaan u maleynayaa sida ay dhab ahaantii sidaas samaynayso
I have other friends who have done the same.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo kale oo sidaas oo kale sameeyay.
I know what you are doing	Waan ogahay waxaad samaynayso
I wondered, really, why he wanted to see me	Waxaan la yaabay, runtii, sababta uu u rabo inuu i arko
Maybe I should do it again	Waxa laga yaabaa in aan mar kale sameeyo
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii badan.
I will take that.	Taas waan qaadan doonaa.
There was no problem	Ma jirin wax dhibaato ah
I think no one will be seen again	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan qofna dib dambe loo arki doonin
Like, really, it is.	Sida, runtii, waa.
And what he did.	Iyo waxa uu sameeyay.
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
I think he will get better now	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu hadda fiicnaan doono
Maybe I can get an idea of ​​it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan fikrad ka helo
I have no intention of doing so	Wax niyad ah uma hayo arrintan
That may be true.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa run.
You can't do anything.	Waxba kama qaban kartid.
I went to work.	Waxaan aaday shaqada.
It was a lot.	Wax badan bay ahayd.
I knew nothing.	Waxba maan garanayn.
I should have known the same way	Waxay ahayd in sidaas oo kale la ii ogaado
It is very difficult for someone to do that.	Aad bay u adag tahay in qof sidaas sameeyo.
I did not understand at first	Maan fahmin markii hore
No one is here, he told her.	Halkan qofna ma joogo, ayuu u sheegay.
This is a big deal and really needed.	Tani waa wax weyn oo runtii loo baahan yahay.
I think that is true	Waxaan filayaa in taasi run tahay
I did nothing wrong	Wax xun maan samayn
I just stayed there.	Halkaas ayaan iska joogay.
I did not understand that.	Maan fahmin taas.
First, you can do it ahead of time.	Marka hore, waxaad samayn kartaa waqti ka hor.
He told me where I could find it, really.	Wuxuu ii sheegay meesha aan ka heli karo, dhab ahaantii.
Not much.	Ma badna.
I think someone knows	Waxaan filayaa in qof garanayo
I thought that was less intelligent.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ka yar tahay caqli.
He had a very good car.	Wuxuu lahaa baabuur aad u fiican.
Everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
I thought you could not	Waxaan u maleeyay inaadan awoodin
But he thought he was out.	Laakiin wuxuu u maleeyay inuu ka soo baxay.
But it is very difficult here.	Laakiin aad bay u adag tahay halkan.
You will soon be with him.	Dhawaan waad la joogi doontaa isaga.
Maybe he saw it differently.	Malaha si kale ayuu u arkay.
As a friend.	Sida saaxiib.
Even that.	Xitaa taas.
I don't have one	mid ma haysto
More on this please.	Wax badan oo tan ah fadlan.
It would be great.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid weyn.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma hayo.
I knew it was different	Waan ogaa inay si kale ahayd
But he never came.	Laakiin waligiis ma iman.
But hard luck.	Laakiin nasiib adag.
I hope we can still be friends.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan wali saaxiibo noqon karno.
It was very clear and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u cad oo qurux badan.
I wanted to know why	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sababta
Maybe he knew.	Malaha wuu ogaa.
I was told that.	Loo sheegay in aan.
Take what it is.	U qaado waxa ay tahay.
Maybe so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas tahay.
They need us.	Way noo baahan yihiin.
I guess he doesn't like me	Waxaan filayaa inuusan i jeclayn
It has always been true.	Had iyo jeer run bay ahayd.
I wonder if it is good	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay fiican tahay
Everyone is well done.	Qof walba si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan filayaa inaad i caawin karto.
I have never done this before	Weligay tan hore uma samayn
I can't see very well	Aad uma arki karo
I knew he would not do it	Waxaan ogaa in uusan yeeli doonin
But everyone knows.	Laakiin qof kastaa wuu ogyahay.
A lot could be done.	Wax badan ayaa la qaban lahaa.
I owe you one time.	Hal waqti ayaan kugu leeyahay.
I tried to leave as well	Waxaan isku dayay inaan sidoo kale ka baxo
I have an urgent job for you	Waxaan kuu hayaa shaqo degdeg ah
But they did not do the same.	Laakiin ma aysan samayn wax la mid ah.
I would love to know where she is	Aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado halka ay joogto
I didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inaan sameeyo.
I will not return there	Halkaas kuma noqon doono
All he knew was that he felt strange.	Waxa kaliya ee uu ogyahay waxay ahayd inuu dareemay wax yaab leh.
I know it belongs to me	Waan ogahay inay aniga leedahay
I need to know you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku ogaado
It was time.	Waxay ahayd waqti.
That doesn't matter to me.	Taasi aniga waxba igama aha.
I need more.	In ka badan ayaan u baahanahay.
But now, maybe, you can come out again.	Laakiin hadda, malaha, waad soo bixi kartaa mar kale.
I am nothing and everything	Anigu waxba iyo wax walba ma ihi
It was like.	Waxay ahayd sida.
He could no longer see.	Wax dambe ma uu arki karin.
I do it often.	Inta badan waan sameeyaa.
I do not understand why this is so.	Ma fahmin sababta ay tani sidaas u tahay.
That is what we are doing now.	Taasi waa waxa aan hadda samayno.
What can you give?	Maxaad siin kartaa?.
It really was a coincidence.	Runtii waxay ahayd wax iska yimid.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I could not see anything.	Waxba maan arki karin.
I am very happy to do it.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay samaynta.
I was surprised there were so many	Waxaan la yaabay inay aad u badan yihiin
If they do, it's not a big deal.	Haddii ay sameeyaan, wax weyn maaha.
I would expect better.	Waxaan filan lahaa si ka wanaagsan.
But anything other than that was great.	Laakiin wax kale oo aan taas ahayn waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I think you have no problem telling me	Waxaan u malaynayaa in aanay dhib kugu jirin in aan kuu sheego
But that was for several years.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd dhowr sano.
It's like home.	Waa sida guriga oo kale.
I can't help it.	Ma caawin karo.
I didn't do much.	Wax badan maan qaban.
I will go back and find it tomorrow.	Waan ku noqon doonaa oo berri ayaan heli doonaa.
I think he tried to tell me something	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu isku dayay inuu wax ii sheego
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I had to tell someone.	Waxay ahayd inaan qof u sheego.
I wonder where that might be	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka ay taasi noqon karto
big and small.	weyn iyo wax yar.
Probably.	Waxay u badan tahay.
I found something you need to do for me	Waxaan helay wax aad u baahan tahay inaad ii samayso
Let it do.	Ha sameyso.
I am not like that.	Anigu sidaas ma ihi.
He was old, he was old, maybe he was even a good man.	Waa hore, waa hore, waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xitaa ahaa nin wanaagsan.
what is that 	waa maxay taasi?'
I would like you to stay with me	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad ila joogto
I'll talk to you later	Dib ayaan ula hadli doonaa
You really didn't tell me anything.	Runtii waxba ima aadan sheegin.
Nice to see you again.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan mar kale arko.
I wish I had him here	Waxaan jeclahay in isaga halkan ku haysto
Maybe they will give you better food.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku siin doonaan cunto ka wanaagsan.
It was an amazing day.	Waxay ahayd maalin yaab leh.
It was again now.	Waxay ahayd mar kale hadda.
Maybe more than one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan hal.
Him and me.	Isaga iyo aniga.
I had to do what was best for me	Waxay ahayd inaan sameeyo wixii aniga ii wanaagsan
I think he tried to tell us something	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu isku dayay inuu wax noo sheego
I could not find a place	Meel baan arki waayay
It would be so.	Waxay noqon lahayd sidaas.
I'm sorry friend.	waan ka xumahay saaxiib.
You can go	Waad tagi kartaa
And there are good things and bad things.	Oo waxaa jira waxyaabo wanaagsan iyo waxyaabo xun.
Very little, really.	Aad u yar, dhab ahaantii.
Now I saw it and picked it up	Hadda ayaan arkay oo soo qaaday
Which he could not.	Taas oo uu awoodi waayay.
That's how he lives.	Waa sida uu u nool yahay.
Only that and nothing else.	Kaliya taas iyo wax kale ma jiraan.
I just can't stay here	Kaliya halkan kuma joogi karo
There is nothing, no one to see anything.	Waxba ma jiro, qofna ma jiro si uu u arko wax jira.
I had to eat	Waxay ahayd inaan wax cuno
I don't feel right.	Wax sax ah ma dareemayo.
You can find a lot more like this here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa wax badan oo tan oo kale ah halkan.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag mid la mid ah
I hope you will love it !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto!.
I had to go every day	Waxay ahayd inaan maalin walba tago
He is just a man.	Waa nin kaliya.
It can be good, it can not be good.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan, ma fiicnaan kartaa.
True, but here too there is wonder.	Run, laakiin halkan sidoo kale waxaa jira yaab.
I love you the way you are	Waan ku jeclahay sida aad tahay
Keep me busy	Igu mashquul
Maybe I can do it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan sameeyo
And he wanted to know why.	Oo wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado sababta.
And he did a lot.	Oo wax badan sameeyay.
Maybe I get more out of him	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ka helo wax ka badan isaga
I could not speak to him	Waan waayay si aan ula hadlo
I pretended to be.	Taas ayaan iska dhigay.
It is several years.	Waa dhowr sano.
But I can't see where he is.	Laakiin meel uu joogo ma arki karo.
I can stay and do	Waan joogi karaa oo waan samayn karaa
I just can’t get enough interest in someone else.	Kaliya ma heli karo xiiso ku filan qof kale.
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
But everyone else loves it.	Laakiin qof kasta oo kale wuu jecel yahay.
I can't do this right now	Tan hadda ma samayn karo
After that it can be even more so.	Taas ka dib waxay noqon kartaa xitaa ka sii badan.
I was really impressed	Runtii aad baan ula dhacay
I wanted to get out of there.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas ka baxo.
Man, but there was none.	Nin, laakiin ma ay jirin.
I have no idea what he sees in me	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa uu igu arko
I don't think much of him.	Wax badan isaga uma malaynayo.
But he knew how it felt.	Laakiin wuu ogaa sida uu dareemayo.
As it has always been very long.	Sida ay had iyo jeer ahayd mid aad u dheer.
There was very little.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u yar.
I knew they would not do it	Waan ogaa in aysan yeeli doonin
I could not take it	Ma aan qaadan karin
I got that from him	Taas ayaan uga helay isaga
I know he can do the job for us	Waan ogahay inuu shaqada noo qaban karo
I can do a lot for you	Wax badan ayaan kuu qaban karaa
He didn't even want to see anyone.	Xitaa ma uusan rabin inuu qof arko.
It doesn't look pretty.	Qurux uma eka.
I really don't know who she is.	Runtii ma garanayo cidda ay tahay.
Very, very happy.	Aad iyo aad u faraxsan.
I hope they don't like it very much	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan aad u jeclayn
Maybe I will never see him again.	Malaha mar dambe ma arki doono isaga.
I thought he did great things.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu sameeyay waxyaabo aad u wanaagsan.
She is still fine.	Wali way wanaagsan tahay.
I would like to know why	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sababta
Better food, better everything.	Cunto ka wanaagsan, wax walba ka wanaagsan.
I just want to see him	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan arko isaga
No one knew where he was.	Meesha cidna kuma uu garanayn.
It is good for any man.	Waxay u fiican tahay nin kasta.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
I said nothing else.	Wax kale ma odhan.
I know you would like that.	Waan ogahay inaad taas jeclaan lahayd.
No one knows who she really is.	Qofna ma garanayo cidda ay dhab ahaantii tahay.
I don't think that can happen	U malayn maayo inay taasi dhici karto
Until tonight.	Ilaa caawa.
He did it for me.	Aniga ayaa ii sameeyay.
I do not know who he is.	Ma garanayo qofka uu yahay.
Of course this is not always the case.	Run ahaantii tani mar walba sidaas maaha.
you are right	sax baad tahay
I clearly saw that he had another	Waxaan si cad u arkay inuu mid kale leeyahay
Everything you want will be done.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto waa la samayn doonaa.
I saw.	waan arkay.
It may have been a lot, but that was not the case.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu waxyaabo badan ahaa, laakiin taasi ma ahayn.
Not what I need.	Ma aha waxa aan u baahanahay.
I think that's why he came here	Waxay ila tahay sababta uu halkan u yimid
I just wanted to help him.	Waxaan rabay oo kaliya inaan caawiyo isaga.
I just want to get to know you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku barto
I just can't give it to him	Kaliya ma siin karo isaga
Now it can end every day.	Hadda way dhammaan kartaa maalin kasta.
I may not do it again.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan mar dambe samayn.
I certainly can't.	Hubaal ma awoodo.
I can spend a lot of money on this	Waxaan ku bixin karaa lacag badan tan
This is who you really are.	Tani waa qofka aad dhab ahaantii tahay.
I should have expected that.	Waxay ahayd inaan taas filan lahaa.
I can't give you that	Taas kuma siin karo
I should not have told you	Ma ahayn inaan kuu sheego
Not found.	Lama helin.
Probably not.	Laga yaabaa in aanay u badan tahay.
It will definitely happen.	Waa hubaal inay dhici doonto.
Nin yar.	Nin yar.
It felt the same way.	Waxa la dareemay sidaas oo kale.
There were a few after that.	Waxaa jiray dhowr wax yar ka dib.
What a great man.	Waa maxay nin weyn.
I have no idea what is coming	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa soo socda
He wants to be there.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu halkaas joogo.
I know what will happen	Waan ogahay waxa dhici doona
I think it's good.	Wax fiican bay ila tahay.
I do not see.	Ma arko.
I got it, you know.	Waan helay, waad ogtahay.
It needs to be seen.	Waxay u baahan tahay in la arko.
It may be good for money.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ku fiican yahay lacag.
Maybe too bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u xun.
I paid you more than this	Waxa aan ku siiyay lacag ka badan tan
I could not say the same as someone else	Ma aan odhan karin mid la mid ah qof kale
I had to tell her	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego
You need a car.	Waxaad u baahan tahay baabuur.
I should have known	Waxay ahayd in aan ogaado
Just a little bit.	Kaliya xoogaa yar.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan ayaa ku jira.
He is not one of us.	Ma aha mid naga mid ah.
I was clear	Waxaan ahaa cad
I was lucky.	Waxaan ahaa nasiib.
He looked surprised to see me.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid la yaabay inuu i arko.
I am very serious about this	Aad ayaan uga dhab ahay arrintan
Hal.	Hal.
But time will tell.	Laakiin waqti ayaa sheegi doona.
I wondered what had happened	Waxaan la yaabay waxa ku dhacay
I went back.	Dib baan u noqday.
I did the same thing.	Waxaan sameeyay wax la mid ah.
That was a problem for someone else.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhib qof kale.
I have done this several times	Tan waxaan sameeyay dhowr jeer
I would love it.	Aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa.
It is always so.	Had iyo jeer waa sidaas.
But very little.	Laakiin aad u yar.
I really can't do much more	Runtii wax badan oo kale ma qaban karo
Often it is not a big problem.	Inta badan ma aha dhibaato weyn.
I love it here	Waan jeclahay halkan
Yesterday I did not get a chance to go	Shalay maan helin fursad aan ku tago
I don't really see.	Anigu ma arko runtii.
I think this can help	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto
Still, he was here.	Weli, halkan ayuu ahaa.
He is not a great man.	Ma aha nin weyn.
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
When everything is great, there is nothing.	Marka wax walba waa weyn yihiin, waxba ma jiraan.
Much better.	Si aad u badan ayaa ka wanaagsan.
And not again.	Oo mar kale maaha.
I need to know what to do here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxaan halkan ka sameeyo
Not only was it beautiful.	Ma ahayn oo kaliya inay qurux badan tahay.

I did not want to talk about this	Ma aanan rabin inaan arrintan ka hadlo
Leave nothing to chance.	Waxba uga tagin fursad.
I suspect someone said that	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in qof sidaas yidhi
So far so good, I haven't spent much time.	Ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan, waqti badan kuma bixin.
Only for a short time.	Kaliya wakhti yar.
A lot has happened quickly	Wax badan ayaa u dhacay si degdeg ah
I need him to do it again.	Waxaan u baahanahay inuu mar kale sameeyo.
Someone has to say what it is	Qof waa inuu sheego waxa ay tahay
I did not get it yesterday	Shalay maan helin
Maybe he won't get another chance	Malaha fursad kale ma heli doono
But they may not know it well.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan si fiican u garanayn.
I wondered how long that would take	Waxaan la yaabay inta ay taasi qaadan doonto
They will tell me.	Way ii sheegi doonaan.
He was in the other room.	Qolka kale ayuu ku jiray.
There he had a friend.	Halkaas ayuu saaxiib kula lahaa.
I have to do this alone	Waa inaan tan keligaa sameeyaa
I went into something bigger	Waxaan galay wax ka weyn
I just saw it by chance	Kaliya waxaan ku arkay nasiib
I have not seen him in more than three years	Saddex sano ka badan ma arag
It can go away.	Way bixi kartaa.
No problems were found	Wax dhib ah lama helin
Not much, now and again.	Wax badan maaha, hadda iyo mar kale.
Very happy, like yesterday.	Aad u faraxsan, sida shalay oo kale.
He is a good person.	Waa qof wanaagsan.
Someone else did.	Qof kale ayaa sameeyay.
He gave everything.	Wax walba wuu siin jiray.
I have never seen him like that	Weligay ma arag isaga oo kale
He wants something else for you.	Wax kale ayuu kuu rabaa.
I thought it looked a little weird	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu u muuqday wax yar oo yaab leh
Not so now.	Hadda sidaas maaha.
Harder	Ka adag
I can't give you that hard	Wax adag kuma siin karo taas
We just have to do what we do.	Kaliya in aan samayno waxa aan samayno.
Which can be considered a big problem.	Taas oo loo qaadan karo dhibaato weyn.
I will not see him.	Ma arki doono isaga.
I can do it	Waan samayn karaa
Maybe I should do the same	Malaha waa inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyaa
What else is there ?.	Maxaa kale oo jira?.
I just want you to like it too	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay
No one did great things.	Qofna wax weyn kama samayn.
He would leave.	Wuu bixi lahaa.
There are so many.	Halkaas ayaa aad ugu badan.
I don't know what's going on here.	Ma garanayo waxa halkan ka socda.
I want to tell him to leave me	Waxaan rabaa inaan u sheego inuu iga tago
I do not want to know	Ma rabo inaan ogaado
I was not able to do it	Ma awoodin in aan sameeyo
It really is a bad idea.	Runtii waa fikrad xun.
I saw you.	waan ku arkay.
He is there.	Wuu joogaa.
I know what you would do with it	Waan ogahay waxaad ku samayn lahayd
A long time ago	Muddo dheer ka hor
Similarly, she had.	Si la mid ah, waxay lahayd.
I was just not ready to say that.	Kaliya diyaar uma ahayn inaan taas u sheego.
He knows it very well.	Si fiican ayuu u garanayaa.
I have never been home	Weligay guriga ma iman
I know you need him now	Waan ogahay inaad u baahan tahay isaga hadda
I have never been	Weligay ma aanan noqon
I love working with you	Waxaan jeclahay inaan adiga kula shaqeeyo
I will not just leave.	Kaliya iska tagi maayo.
I was something else	Wax kale ayaan ahaa
This was the time.	Tani waxay ahayd markii.
I wanted more	Wax badan ayaan rabay
It can even help.	Xitaa way ku caawin kartaa .
As expected.	Inta la filan karo.
It seems harmless.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid aan dhib lahayn.
I took everything from you	Wax walba waan kaa qaatay
I have no idea how to do this.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto sida tan loo sameeyo.
I think someone came to him	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof u yimid isaga
I just want you home	Kaliya waxaan kaa rabaa guriga
I really know that	Runtii taas waan ogahay
It would be nice to do it again.	Way fiicnaan lahayd inaad mar kale samayso.

It is amazingly beautiful.	Waa qurux yaab leh.
I hope he will.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameyn doono.
As a person.	Sida qofka.
I have nothing to do	Ma hayo wax aan sameeyo
I need a big one	Waxaan u baahanahay mid weyn
A little hard to find	In yar oo adag in la helo
In fact, he was.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu ahaa.
I just didn’t want to	Ma aanan rabin oo kaliya
Stop that.	Jooji taas.
I could not see	Ma arki karin
I can see it is hard work.	Waxaan arki karaa inay tahay shaqo adag.
Is that so bad.	Ma sidaas baa u xun.
I did something wrong	Waxaan sameeyay wax xun
Please, stop this.	Fadlan, jooji tan.
You are much bigger than that.	Waxaad tahay wax aad uga weyn taas.
There was no chance of being seen.	Ma jirin wax fursad ah oo lagu arki lahaa.
Maybe I should be sorry about that.	Malaha waa inaan ka xumahay taas.
He knew he couldn't leave yet.	Waxa uu ogaa in aanu weli bixi karin.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Not sure where to leave here.	Ma hubo meesha aan ka tago halkan.
I just want to help	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
One.	Mid ka mid ah.
I did everything.	Wax walba waan sameeyay.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
I wish she was here with me again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay halkan ila joogto mar kale

I hope you are there	Waxaan filayaa inaad halkaas joogto
A little while ago.	Wax yar ka hor.
But this is really good.	Laakiin tani runtii way wanaagsan tahay.
She even said she had no friends.	Waxay xitaa sheegtay inaysan lahayn saaxiibo.
I just wonder if they are	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay haddii ay yihiin
I really did not want to go there	Runtii ma rabin inaan aado halkaas
It’s what he likes.	Waa waxa uu jecel yahay.
Before now and as you would like.	Hadda ka hor hadda oo aad jeclaan lahayd.
He saw you.	Wuu ku arkay.
I hope he finds out	Waxaan filayaa inuu ogaado
But it could not be.	Laakiin ma ay noqon karin.
It hasn't been long.	Muddo dheer ma ay ahayn.
That is what we can say for sure.	Taasi waa waxa aan si hubaal ah u sheegi karno.
She will find you.	Way ku heli doontaa.

This was when, years later.	Tani waxay ahayd markii, sano ka dib.
I know it won't hurt you	Waan ogahay inuusan waxba kuu yeeli doonin
He wanted me there.	Halkaas ayuu iga rabay.
I will not say anything about it	Anigu waxba naga odhan maayo
I had to see what he would do	Waxay ahayd inaan arko wuxuu samayn lahaa
I don't like it.	Ma jecla.
I just looked	Kaliya waan eegay
I will tell you again	Mar kale ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa
But now is the day.	Laakiin hadda waa maalin.
No one else was in the room.	Qof kale ma joogin qolka.
Maybe more than one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan hal.
I am very serious about this.	Aad ayaan uga dhab ahay arrintan.
Maybe she’s happy here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay halkan ku faraxsan tahay.
It was not	Ma ahaan jirin
And only there.	Oo halkaas kaliya.
I'm lucky	nasiib ayaan leeyahay
I just know she’s good at it	Kaliya waan ogahay inay ku fiican tahay
Do not talk to anyone about what has just happened.	Qofna ha kala hadlin waxa hadda dhacay.
I did a few of them.	Waxaan sameeyay dhowr ka mid ah.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
I wonder if he feels that way	Waxaan la yaabanahay in uu sidaas dareemayo
I would just go to him	Kaliya waan tagi lahaa isaga
I can't believe he didn't see me	Ma rumaysan karo inuusan i arag
He knew it was near.	Wuu ogaa inay meel u dhow tahay.
Very beautiful every day.	Aad u qurux badan maalin kasta.
Picked up later.	Soo qaaday ka dib.
That was lucky.	Taasi waxay ahayd nasiib.
I had nothing better to do	Ma haysan wax ka fiican oo aan sameeyo
I'm just happy.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay.
I could be someone else	Waxaan noqon karaa qof kale
I said nothing else	Wax kale ma odhan
He can go back to other things.	Waxyaabo kale ayuu dib ugu noqon karaa.
We were a lot of friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo badan.
I was a little bit beautiful	Waxaan ahaa wax yar oo qurux badan
It's you.	Waa adiga.
I thought maybe	Waxaan u maleeyay inay malaha lahayd
I didn't think so, but we had to do something	Uma malaynayn sidaas, laakiin waxay ahayd inaan wax samayno
I still love it	Wali waan jeclahay
I can't lie about that.	Taas been kama sheegi karo.
I had to be somewhere else and otherwise.	Waxay ahayd inaan joogo meel kale iyo si kale.
I am a real person.	Waxaan ahay qof dhab ah.
I want to know what they do.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxay sameeyaan.
It's all true, you know.	Dhammaan waa run, waad ogtahay.
It will not be tomorrow.	Berri dambe ma ahaan doono.
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
In the same way people.	Si la mid ah dadka.
He heard everything you said to this day.	Wuxuu maqlay wax walba oo aad sheegtay ilaa maanta.
I want to know something similar	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wax la mid ah
I do that all the time	Taas ayaan sameeyaa mar walba
He decided the latter.	Wuxuu go'aansaday kii dambe.
I would like you to tell me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad ii sheegto.
I did not want him	Maan rabin isaga
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
I should not have had it again	Ma aanan ahayn inaan mar kale haysto
I did not want him to leave	Maan rabin inuu ka baxo
That is what we need.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
Also.	Sidoo kale.
I thought nothing of it	Waxba uma malaynayn
No one really did.	Runtii qofna ma samayn.
I still need it, just like everyone else.	Weli waan u baahanahay, sida dadka kale.
And not just you.	Oo adiga kaliya maaha.
I saw it as a good time	Waxaan u arkay waqti fiican
Do not leave anything out.	Waxba ha ka tagin.
I was a bit like you	Waxaan ahaa xoogaa adiga oo kale ah
I wondered what had happened	Waxaan la yaabay waxa ku dhacay
There is nothing you want to do.	Ma jirto waxaad rabto inaad sameyso.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuu yeeli maayo.
I did not get it at first	Maan helin markii hore
He had a chance for everyone, and everything.	Waxa uu lahaa fursad uu qof kasta, iyo wax walba.
No one said anything about that	Qofna taas waxba kama odhan
I'm sure you can	Waan hubaa inaad samayn karto
I really wanted to help	Aad ayaan u rabay inaan caawiyo
What a day.	Maxaa maalin ah.
Why she said she didn't tell anyone.	Sababta ay u sheegtay in aanay cidna u sheegin.
I should have seen you	Waxay ahayd inaan ku arko
A little too small.	In yar ayaa sidoo kale ka yar.
I have to get everything right	Waa inaan wax walba si sax ah u helo
I have done this for you.	tan ayaan kugu sameeyay.
I never came home.	Weligay guriga ma iman.
They will stay here for less than a day.	Waxay halkan ku joogi doonaan in ka yar hal maalin.
She was who he was now.	Waxay ahayd qofka uu hadda ahaa.
You will probably see each other.	Waxay u badan tahay inaad is arki doonto.
There is something behind it.	Waxaa jira wax ka dib.
We will not do that again.	Taas mar dambe ma samayno.
Really worse than what happened to you.	Runtii aad uga xun waxa kugu dhacay.
That was not really what was going to happen.	Taasi ma ahayn waxa run ahaantii dhici doona.
I will be true to you	run baan kula noqon doonaa
I love being there wherever you are	Waxaan jeclahay inaan joogo meel kasta oo aad joogto
He knew he would never see her again.	Wuu ogaa inuusan mar dambe arki doonin.
I could not leave you	Waan kaa tagi waayay
I really didn't want to talk about it	Runtii ma rabin inaan ka hadlo
Don't leave me yet.	Wali ha iga tagin.
I don't want to do that.	Ma rabo inaan sidaas sameeyo.
Everything we can find.	Wax kasta oo aan heli karno.
That's what it looks like.	Taasi waa sida ay u egtahay.
Exactly how hard it is to say.	Dhab ahaan inta ay adag tahay in la sheego.
I love doing things	Waxaan jeclahay in wax la sameeyo
And maybe it is true.	Oo malaha waa run.
I want to go home while you do	Waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado inta aad sameyso
I'm sure they didn't catch me	Waxaan hubaa in aanay i qaban
They were told they did not.	Waxa loo sheegay in aanay lahayn.
I was the one she said	Waxaan ahaa mid ay sheegtay
It's a man thing.	Waa wax nin.
I can really afford it	Dhab ahaantii waan awoodi karaa
I had to tell him more	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan u sheego
I can help you, you know	Waan ku caawin karaa, waad ogtahay
I know how bad it is	Waan ogahay sida uu u xun yahay
It will not take long	Waqti badan ma qaadan doono
I can't see anything	Waxba ma arki karo
I know she will go to a better place	Waan ogahay inay aadi doonto meel ka wanaagsan
Everything he would have in the back room.	Wax kasta oo uu ku haysan lahaa qolka dambe.
All they have to do is.	Waxa kaliya ee ay tahay inay sameeyaan waa.
I knew it would not be	Waan ogaa inaysan ahaan doonin
I want to talk to him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo
He would tell her that.	Wuxuu u sheegi lahaa taas.
It's better to get out of there	Waxaa fiican inaan halkaas ka baxo
I wish he was here now	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu hadda halkan joogo
They are complicated.	Way dhib badan yihiin.
A job he took seriously	Shaqo uu si dhab ah u qaatay
I made him work but he got it.	Waan ka dhigay inuu u shaqeeyo laakiin wuu helay.
Something in him.	Wax isaga ku jira.
I know he did.	Waan ogahay inuu sameeyay.
I will do it quickly	si degdeg ah ayaan u samayn doonaa
I have to be here with you	Waa inaan halkaan kula joogo
You will believe.	Waad rumaysan doontaa.
He will give everything.	Wax walba wuu siin doonaa.
He certainly got it.	Waxaa hubaal ah inuu helay.
Stop after a while.	Wax yar ka dib jooji.
I may not be able to stay longer	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan waqti dheer sii joogi karin
One said.	Mid ka mid ah ayaa yidhi.
It has a clear promise	Waxay leedahay ballan cad
Like everyone else.	Sida qof kasta oo kale.
I really looked at that.	Runtii taas ayaan eegay.
I'm afraid there is more to come	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay jiraan wax badan oo soo socda
I had a good time with him	Waxaan la qaatay wakhti fiican isaga
It stays.	Way iska joogto.
Nothing, to speak of.	Waxba, si loo hadlo.
I am the only one.	Aniga kaliya ayaa jira.
Someone other than me.	Qof aan aniga ahayn.
It is a busy place.	Waa meel mashquul badan.
I was not yet ready to do it	Wali diyaar uma ahayn inaan sameeyo
Very good, maybe.	Aad u fiican, malaha.
One.	Mid ka mid ah.
It doesn't matter to me.	Waxba igama aha.
I'll catch him right here.	Waxaan ku qaban doonaa isaga isla halkan.
Maybe one day I will do it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hal maalin sameeyo.
I want to do it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo.
I wonder what is in him	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa isaga ku jira
It cannot be done.	Lama samayn karo.
That's what they do.	Taasi waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
He saw the past and the future.	Waxa uu arkay wixii hore iyo waxa soo socda.
No one understood what had happened	Qofna ma fahmin wax dhacay
I did everything	Wax walba waan sameeyay
I know this will not be a problem.	Waan ogahay in tani aysan dhibaato noqon doonin.
I really did not give a chance	Runtii fursad ma siin
Maybe he knew.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ogaa.
Here in the front room.	Halkan qolka hore.
I never said.	Weligay ma odhan.
I was surprised by what he said	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu yidhi
But now it is you.	Laakiin hadda waa adiga.
Probably too much.	Malaha aad u badan.
This is not here and there.	Tani ma aha halkan iyo halkaas.
No one can do anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn karo.
I wanted to get to know him better	Waxaan rabay inaan si fiican u ogaado isaga
I did not get a chance	Fursad maan helin
I will be home soon	Wax yar ka dib ayaan guriga joogi doonaa
More than enough.	In ka badan in ka badan oo ku filan.
One more time.	Hal mar oo kale.
I really know what he does.	Runtii waan garanayaa waxa uu sameeyo.
She had to lie.	Waxay ahayd inay been sheegto.
I don't feel that anymore.	Taas hadda ka dib ma dareemayo.
So close.	Sidaas u dhow.
I do everything for myself	Wax walba waan u sameeyaa aniga
That’s a good thing, really.	Taasi waa wax fiican, dhab ahaantii.
Really fast.	Dhab ahaantii aad u degdeg badan.
He is really sorry.	Runtii wuu ka xun yahay.
I looked again	Mar kale ayaan eegay
I did not like that	Taas maan jeclayn
I do not have time for that	Waqti uma hayo taas
I will do everything.	Wax walba waan sameyn doonaa.
You have not yet	Wali ma aadan
I took something else here	Wax kale ayaan halkan ka soo qaatay
But it is very difficult.	Laakiin aad bay u adag tahay.
I think that is the only thing we can do here tonight	Waxaan filayaa in taasi tahay waxa kaliya ee aan caawa halkan ku sameyn karno
I don't want to see anything.	Ma rabo inaan wax arko.
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
I think that will be the worst thing you will ever get.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi noqon doonto waxa ugu xun ee aad heli doonto.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
I hope to get it soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan helo
I know what he said	Waan garanayaa wuxuu ku yidhi
Do not leave anyone behind.	Qofna ha ka tagin.
It was still me, but it really wasn’t	Weli aniga ayaan ahaa, laakiin run ahaantii ma ahayn
I did not know how he felt	Maan garanayn sida uu dareemayo
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
I suspect no one does.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in qofna sameeyo.
You will be able to go home.	Waxaad awoodi doontaa inaad aado guriga.
I can't, I can't, I can't	Ma awoodo, ma awoodo, ma awoodo
I do not know why she is here	Ma garanayo sababta ay halkan u joogto
A good time was spent together	Waqti fiican ayaa la wada qaatay
There is nothing we can do now.	Wax aan hadda qaban karno ma jiraan.
It just wasn’t the best thing to do.	Kaliya ma ahayn waxa ugu wanaagsan in la sameeyo.
I have no idea about this	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo arrintan
No one.	Qofna ma jiro qofna.
Maybe something happened.	Malaha wax baa dhacay.
He will never do that.	Waligiis ma samayn doono taas.
It is not going to be done.	Ma aha in la qaban doono.
I really enjoyed that.	Aad ayaan uga helay taas.
Unable to help	Waa la caawin waayay
But well.	Laakiin si wanaagsan.
It should.	Waa in ay.
They will come	Way iman doonaan
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
I want to know more about it here	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado halkan
As you should know.	Sida ay tahay inaad ogaato.
Something needs to be done.	Wax loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
No problem.	Dhib maaha.
I think we can help	Waxaan filayaa inaan ku caawin karno
I know this.	Waan ogahay tan.
I can tell you something	Wax baan kaa sheegi karaa
Not much now.	Hadda wax badan maaha.
It probably still is.	Waxay u badan tahay inay weli sidaas tahay.
But it will always be the same	Laakiin had iyo jeer waxay ahaan doontaa wax la mid ah
I hope you will take it with us from time to time	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad nala qaadan doonto mar mar
Maybe I should go to school	Malaha waa inaan dugsiga tago
She can give as much money as she likes.	Waxay siin kartaa lacag badan inta ay jeceshahay.
He looked at him.	Isaga ayuu eegay.
Here I am.	Waa i kan.
I looked the same way	Isku si ayaan u eegay
Otherwise, everything.	Haddii kale, wax kasta.
But no one knew much.	Laakiin qofna wax badan ma ogayn.
I wanted to eat him	Waxaan rabay in aan isaga cuno
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
There is only one.	Waxaa jira hal kaliya.
I was there after school every day	Waxaan halkaas joogi jiray dugsiga ka dib maalin kasta
Now I will not say much	Hadda wax badan odhan maayo
That he does not want to.	In uusan rabin.
I have done the same before	Waxaan hore u sameeyay wax la mid ah
Always seen.	Had iyo jeer la arko.
I have a lot to do and very little time	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan sameeyo iyo waqti aad u yar
I hope they are good	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiican yihiin
There is.	Waxaa jira.
I haven't done that in a long time	Taas maan samayn muddo dheer
I wanted to talk to him	Waxaan rabay inaan wax kala hadlo isaga
A very good person.	Qof aad u wanaagsan.
Today was a lot of fun.	Maanta waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Everything is known here.	Wax walba halkan ayaa lagu yaqaan.
Just about everyone refused to work for me.	Kaliya qof kasta ayaa diiday inuu iga shaqeeyo.
After a few years they will not hurt	Dhowr sano ka dib waxba ma yeeli doonaan
She was definitely ready.	Hubaal diyaar bay ahayd.
time.	waqti.
I wouldn’t stop.	Ma aan joojin lahayn.
Still, it 's amazing.	Weli, waa yaab.
Almost everyone is fine.	Inta badan qof kastaa wuu fiican yahay.
I can do it with a man like you	Nin kula mid ah ayaan ku samayn karaa
I was amazed at how big they were together	Waxa aan la yaabay sida ay u wada weyn yihiin
Maybe I left someone.	Malaha qof baan ka tagay.
You really don't need that much.	Runtii uma baahnid wax sidaas u weyn.
I know why he would go	Waan ogahay sababta uu u tagi lahaa
I am not him.	Aniga ma aha isaga.
I like that from you.	Anigu sidaas ayaan kaa helay.
I left everything to chance	Wax walba fursad ayaan uga tagay
He felt hard.	Si dhib ah ayuu u dareemay.
I tried to help others	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo dadka kale
He felt the same way.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayuu dareemay.
He did not understand that.	Taas ma uu fahmin.
Really, it was really amazing.	Runtii, runtii yaab bay ahayd.
I should not have gone that way	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas ku baxo
It is not permanent.	Ma aha joogto ah.
And how often.	Iyo inta jeer.
Maybe it will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawin doonto.
She said nothing.	Waxay tidhi waxba maaha.
It's hard to be someone else.	Way adag tahay in qof kale yahay.
You are just.	Kaliya baad tahay.
Everything you need to know already exists.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato ayaa hore u jiray.
He didn’t even take the time to do that.	Xitaa waqti kuma qaadan inuu taas sameeyo.
I didn’t really take it	Si dhab ah uma qaadan
I wanted him to do something, to say something	Waxaan rabay inuu wax sameeyo, inuu wax sheego
I think a little.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in yar.
I will not just be your best friend	Kaliya saaxiib fiican kuu noqon maayo
He certainly did.	Waa hubaal inuu sameeyay.
He wondered if that was the case.	Wuxuu is waydiiyay inay sidaas tahay.
What does he know.	Muxuu garanayaa.
I think they are something else.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax kale yihiin.
I am only one person	Waxaan ahay hal qof kaliya
But there was something.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax.
I decided to make one	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan mid sameeyo
He left me.	Wuu iga tagay.
I hope it will be better	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiicnaan doonto
I know you have one.	Waan ogahay inaad mid leedahay.
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
And a good one.	Iyo mid wanaagsan.
Take one tablespoon before each meal	Qaado qaado ka hor cunto kasta
But he wanted to do more.	Laakiin wuxuu rabay inuu wax badan sameeyo.
And fun to be with.	Oo xiiso leh in la joogo.
I think he is very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu aad u fiican yahay.
I did not want to do this	Ma aanan rabin inaan tan sameeyo
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
I know this is not true	Waan ogahay in tani aysan sax ahayn
There is nothing to buy.	Ma jiraan wax la iibsado.
I got everything I needed here	Waxaan helay wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay halkan
I heard this a few years ago	Waxaan tan maqlay dhowr sano ka hor
It is what we do.	Waa waxa aan samayno.
Too much food, too little time.	Cunto aad u badan, waqti aad u yar.
No one did.	Qofna ma samayn.
I looked at something again	Wax baan dib u eegay mar kale
That would be the best.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd tan ugu fiican.
I have a long day tomorrow	Waxaan leeyahay maalin dheer berri
A big problem	Dhibaato weyn
I heard a little, I saw nothing.	Wax yar baan maqlay, waxba ma arag.
I can't say how much he came back before.	Ma sheegi karo inta uu soo noqday ka hor.
I don't like it much, but someone else might.	Ma jecli wax badan, laakiin qof kale ayaa laga yaabaa.
She must have made money.	Waa inay lacag samaysay.
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
He left.	Wuu ka tagay.
Many things are done in this way	Waxyaabo badan ayaa sidaas lagu sameeyaa
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
He should not do anything about it.	Waa inuusan waxba ka qaban.
I thought you did.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad samaysay.
But he did not want to stay there.	Laakiin ma uu doonayn inuu halkaas sii joogo.
I had an idea of ​​where he could be.	Waxaan lahaa fikrad meesha uu joogi karo.
I'm all happy.	Waan faraxsanahay oo dhan.
Find out.	La ogaado.
I really have no idea	Runtii wax fikrad ah ma hayo
I can do something they can't	Waxaan sameyn karaa wax aysan awoodin
But this.	Laakiin tani.
I haven't had this for a very long time	Tani maan helin muddo aad u dheer
I know better than anyone	Waan ogahay in ka fiican qof kasta
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I do not understand	Ma fahmin
And he seems to be very happy doing what he does.	Oo wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu aad ugu faraxsan yahay samaynta wuxuu sameeyo.
I don't know enough, he thought.	Ma garanayo in ku filan, ayuu u maleeyay.
But they did not know that.	Laakiin taas ma ay ogayn.
This was now.	Tani waxay ahayd hadda.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
I wanted to be him	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo isaga
I will not say much about it here.	Wax badan ka sheegi maayo halkan.
There is nothing we can do now.	Ma jiraan wax aan hadda ka qaban karno.
I have to help him	Waa inaan ku caawiyo isaga
I know you need a job	Waan ogahay inaad shaqo u baahan tahay
She did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
I have real and true friends now	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo dhab ah oo run ah hadda
I want to be friends again	Waxaan rabaa in aan mar kale saaxiibo
It doesn’t have to be done for him.	Ma aha in isaga la sameeyo.
I found it beautiful	Waxaan ka helay qurux
And more really.	Iyo in ka badan runtii.
Only often.	Kaliya inta badan.
And it is very good	Oo aad bay u fiican tahay
I felt a lot later	Waxaan dareemay wax badan ka dib
I said no more	Mar dambe ma odhan
I did not want to see anything	Ma rabin inaan wax arko
I started working on making one.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan ka shaqeeyo samaynta mid.
I should not be here	Waa inaan halkan joogin
It had nothing to do with the rest	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn inta kale
He loves me so much.	Aad buu ii jecel yahay.
I have to do that	Waa inaan taas sameeyaa
But this was more than a few.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd in ka badan dhowr.
That is, first.	Taasi waa, hore.
I want to, but not here	Waxaan rabaa, laakiin halkan maaha
I wanted to keep it there	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas ku sii hayo
That is really good.	Taasi runtii way fiican tahay.
He was.	Waxa uu ahaa.
I would really love to have you there	Runtii waan kugu jeclaan lahaa halkaas
I should not have done this	Ma ahayn inaan tan samaynayo
I could not believe you did that	Ma rumaysan karin inaad sidaas samaysay
That can't help.	Taas ma caawin karo.
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo
But he heard me.	Laakiin wuu i maqlay.
I don't think any of us can.	Uma maleynayo in mid naga mid ah uu awoodo.
I really don't know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
He didn't like talking to people now.	Ma jeclayn inuu hadda dadka la hadlo.
He refused.	Taas wuu diiday.
I could not find much	Wax badan ayaan ka heli waayay
It will also not be good.	Sidoo kale ma fiicnaan doonto.
I know all of you	Waan ogahay dhammaan adiga
That is everything.	Taasi waa wax walba.
I hope all is well with a friend	Waxaan rajeynayaa in dhammaan si fiican u wanaagsan yihiin saaxiib
But not here.	Laakiin halkan maaha.
I was in a non-existent place	Waxaan ku jiray meel aan jirin
It is not real.	Ma ahan mid dhab ah.
And it is right for me.	Oo waa ii sax aniga.
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad maan helin.
Let me pick it up.	Aan soo qaado.
That is what we do.	Taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
I should not have told him	Ma ahayn inaan u sheego
I think it is a place.	Waxay ila tahay inay tahay meel.
I did not know you were one of them.	Ma garanayn inaad ka mid tahay.
I think this is for me	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tani aniga ii tahay
I have never seen him so happy.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo aad u faraxsan.
I wanted to see what would happen	Waxaan rabay inaan arko waxa dhici doona
I want you to do this right	Waxaan rabaa inaad tan si sax ah u sameyso
Not sure where.	Ma hubo meesha.
I need to do more	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan sameeyo
I can't say much.	Wax badan ma odhan karo.
.	.
I know it was for me.	Waan ogahay inay aniga ii ahayd.
I know nothing about him	Waxba kama garanayo isaga
I was still in school.	Weli waxaan ku jiray dugsiga.
Not sure.	Lama hubo.
I thought that was great	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi weyn tahay
But another will come.	Laakiin mid kale ayaa iman doona.
I will tell you what to do.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxaad sameyso.
Not so much, really.	Ma aha sidaas u badan, runtii.
I would be that for you	Taas ayaan kuu ahaan lahaa
They exist now.	Hadda way jiraan.
I have never been to a man	Weligay nin lama joogin
I know you like it.	Waan ogahay inaad jeceshahay.
That was all for me.	Taasi waxay ahayd aniga oo dhan.
We need it more than ever.	Waxaan ugu baahanahay in ka badan sidii hore.
I think it is very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u fiican tahay.
It will be seen whether you did it or not.	Waa la arki doonaa inaad samaysay iyo in kale.
I am an everyday person	Waxaan ahay qof maalin walba jira
Seen	La arkay
I wanted to tell him everything really	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba u sheego dhab ahaantii
More time than we need, really.	Waqti ka badan inta aan u baahanahay, runtii.
No wonder.	Wax yaab leh ma jiraan.
I always looked up	Had iyo jeer waan eegay
She did.	Way samaysay.
I may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan noqon.
Maybe it can help me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay i caawin karto.
I can give you everything, everything	Waxaan ku siin karaa wax kasta, wax kasta oo dhan
I did not tell him why	Maan u sheegin sababta
You did not succeed.	Waxba ma aad guulaysan.
I put it here	Halkan ayaan dhigay
He was a very good friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib aad u wanaagsan.
I have a lot of friends there	Waxaan halkaas ku leeyahay saaxiibo badan
He still has not succeeded	Wali ma guulaysan
I can't go back to prison	Kuma noqon karo xabsiga
Not that it would help much.	Ma aha in ay wax badan caawin lahayd.
That is, and more.	Taasi waa, iyo wax ka badan.
I was surprised.	Waan la yaabay.
Who knew how great, but something.	Yaa ogaa sida weyn, laakiin wax.
You are too small.	Aad baad u yar tahay.
I had to leave the place from time to time	Waxay ahayd inaan ka baxo meesha mar mar
I can help you with this	Waan kaa caawin karaa tan
I had no idea what she was doing	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxay samaynayso
I don't mind that.	Dhib igama qabo taas.
I do not know how he can do this	Ma garanayo sida uu tan u samayn karo
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
A little, but not often.	Wax yar, laakiin maaha inta badan.
I am very scared of him	Aad ayaan uga baqayaa isaga
He became a good friend.	Waxa uu noqday saaxiib fiican.
I know what she does	Waan ogahay waxay samaynayso
And much less.	Oo aad uga yar.
I have no idea what is in it	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku jira
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
I really did not know what to expect	Runtii ma garanayn waxaan filan lahaa
There is not enough time.	Ma jiro waqti ku filan.
I really shouldn't have.	Runtii ma ahayn inaan.
I was surprised he could see me better	Waxaan la yaabay inuu si ka wanaagsan ii arki karo
That is what I will do here.	Taasi waa waxa aan ku sameyn doono halkan.
He picked it up.	Wuu soo qaaday.
I wouldn’t be much.	Anigu ma noqon lahaa wax badan.
I don’t think you will give it to us.	Uma maleynayo inaad na siin doonto.
That can be interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid xiiso leh.
He took what he wanted.	Waxa uu rabay ayuu qaatay.
That was awful, but there was even worse to come.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun, laakiin waxaa jiray xitaa ka sii xun inuu yimaado.
I thought he loved me	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu i jecel yahay
I will definitely do this again.	Dhab ahaantii waan samayn doonaa tan mar kale.
But it is very rare.	Laakiin aad bay u yar tahay.
I have never seen anything like it before	Hadda ka hor ma arag wax la mid ah
We can't find anyone like that.	Ma heli karno qof sidaas oo kale ah.
I don't want it anymore	Mar dambe ma rabo
I still want the job	Weli waxaan rabaa shaqada
I don't know exactly why this will be.	Ma garanayo dhab ahaan sababta ay tani u noqon doonto.
I think that is the only thing we can do	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay tahay waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno
It can help	Way ku caawin kartaa
I love you, you say.	Waan ku jeclahay, waxaad leedahay.
Just you.	Adiga oo kaliya.
I hope he is fine.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu fiican yahay.
It has a place.	Meel bay leedahay.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
I can leave here at any time	Waxaan ka bixi karaa halkan waqti kasta
It could not be.	Ma noqon karin.
He knows me.	Wuu iga yaqaan.
Enough, he thought.	Ku filan, ayuu u maleeyay.
Not everywhere.	Ma aha meel kasta.
That is the biggest thing for me.	Taasi waa waxa igu weyn aniga.
He decided.	Wuu go’aansaday.
I thought to tell.	Waxaan u maleeyay in la sheego.
This is great.	Tani waa mid weyn.
I need to know what is at stake	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxa la isku hayo
You can't win.	Ma guulaysan kartid.
I know where you can find it !.	Waan ogahay meesha aad ka heli karto!.
No one wants that !.	Qofna taas ma rabo!.
That was given.	Taasi waa la siiyay.
There is no way to tell.	Ma jirto si loo sheego.
Well, really.	Si fiican, dhab ahaantii.
Sorry you are happy at home	Waan ka xumahay inaad guriga ku faraxsan tahay
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
It was hard work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
It can be true for one person and false for another.	Waxay noqon kartaa run hal qof iyo been ka kale.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
I really got it	Runtii waan helay
I was not a big man	Maan ahayn nin weyn
There was no one else.	Qof kale ma jirin.
I am very happy to see you	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko
And it's not just an opportunity.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya fursad.
But he is there.	Laakiin wuu joogaa.
I can't stop anything	Waxba kama joojin karo
Here it is very nice.	Halkan waa mid aad u fiican.
Maybe you can tell me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ii sheegi karto.
Definitely, well.	Dhab ahaantii, si fiican.
You are one.	Mid baad tahay.
I was amazed at how friendly everyone was.	Waxaan la yaabay sida qof walba saaxiib u yahay.
Until recently that was the case.	Ilaa dhawaan waa taas.
And another.	Iyo mid kale.
There was not much.	Wax badan kuma jirin.
She does not have to be here.	Ma aha inay halkan joogto.
I had to go out and buy everything else	Waxay ahayd inaan baxo oo aan iibsado wax kasta oo kale
I may not have time for it	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan waqti u helin
I knew he wanted to leave	Waan ogaa inuu doonayo inuu baxo
I hope he is happy with this	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu ku faraxsan yahay kan
Maybe I want to see what comes next	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan rabo inaan arko waxa soo socda
I tried everything	Wax walba waan isku dayay
And so true.	Oo sidaas run.
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
I can't do it now.	Ma awoodo hadda.
I want to know everything, too	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ogaado, sidoo kale
Really, I really enjoyed it.	Runtii, runtii waan ka helay.
That was real.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
I will always love you, no matter	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa, dhib malaha
This was him.	Tani waxay ahayd isaga.
I would like to know how	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sida
I can see that.	Waan arki karaa taas.
All work.	Dhammaan shaqada.
It was set as it should be.	Waxa loo dhigay sidii uu ahaan lahaa.
Not as he thought.	Ma aha sidii uu u malayn lahaa.
I was very busy until late	Aad ayaan mashquul u ahaa ilaa goor dambe
Maybe I should do the same.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan sidoo kale sameeyo.
Certainly not.	Run ahaantii maaha.
Is it me? 	Ma aniga baa?
I really need to talk to someone	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof la hadlo
You have a place to live.	Leedahay meel guriga ah.
I did not want to tell you	Maan rabin inaan kuu sheego
But you will love it.	Laakiin waad jeclaan doontaa.
This was the main reason for everything.	Tani waxay ahayd sababta ugu weyn ee wax walba.
I knew you would do it again	Waan ogaa inaad mar kale samayn doonto
A lot of hard work and clear	Shaqo adag oo badan oo cad
He didn't like to talk to her, he didn't get much.	Ma uu jeclayn in uu la hadlo, wax badan kuma helin.
I wanted to leave work	Waxaan rabay inaan shaqada ka tago
Nothing like him	Wax isaga la mid ah uma eka
That was a hard truth.	Taasi waxay ahayd run adag.
I was not allowed to go	Waa la ii diiday inaan tago
No one knows what they are.	Qofna ma garanayo waxay yihiin.
I hope, he was already.	Waxaan rajeynayaa, inuu hore u ahaa.
I will get you something to do.	Waxaan kuu heli doonaa wax aad samayso.
He is not here now.	Hadda halkan ma joogo.
Can't help.	Lama caawin karo.
I will take you, if you want	waan ku qaadan doonaa, haddii aad rabto
I wanted to learn from you	Waxaan rabay inaan wax kaa barto
I'm sure you will see that.	Waan hubaa inaad taas arki doonto.
I would like to know if it would be good	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado haddii ay fiicnaan lahayd
I can't see anything	Waxba ma arki karo
I do not want to talk to you	Ma rabo inaan kula hadlo
He should have come back earlier.	Waxay ahayd inuu mar hore soo noqdo.
I know how to find you	waan garanayaa si aan kuu helo
But I really did not understand how to do it.	Laakiin runtii ma fahmin sida loo sameeyo.
I did not even know you would have me	Xitaa maan garanayn inaad i haysan lahayd
I love everything	Wax walba waan jeclahay
I think we can do this	Waxaan filayaa inaan samayn karno tan
I'm happy buddy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay saaxiib.
Only, really.	Kaliya, runtii.
I told her what that was.	Waxaan u sheegay waxa ay taasi ahayd.
They are very good at home.	Aad bay ugu fiican yihiin guriga.
I have to see you again	Waa inaan mar kale arko
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma uu sheegin.
I asked him to stay with me	Waxaan ka codsaday inuu la sii joogo
As for sure today.	Sida hubaal maanta.
I want to study	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax barto
I looked back at him	Waxaan dib u eegay isaga
I think you will enjoy it	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad ka heli doonto isaga
It was smaller.	Waxay ahayd mid ka yar.
The only thing to do.	Waxa kaliya ee la sameeyo.
I think he loves you	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu ku jecel yahay adiga
I know very little about you.	Wax yar ayaan kaa ogahay.
He will not be able to leave.	Ma awoodi doono inuu baxo.
I am not sure of this	Anigu ma hubo tan
He could not lie	Been ka sheegi waayay
I was lucky to have him	Nasiib baan helay isaga
I'm happy.	waan ku faraxsanahay.
With a friend.	La saaxiib.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
And, he really was a great guy.	Oo, runtii wuxuu ahaa nin aad u fiican.
I tried to pick it up.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan soo qaado.
It was the right thing to do.	Waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
He got into trouble.	Dhib buu ku dhacay.
That is	Taasi waa
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I will make an appointment for you	Ballan ayaan kuu samayn doonaa
Very lucky.	Aad u nasiib badan.
I had to see you one more time	Waxay ahayd inaan ku arko hal mar oo kale
That would be something.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax.
I need to talk to you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
A good time was spent together	Waqti fiican ayaa la wada qaatay
This can be a no-brainer.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax aan waxba ahayn.
Not either.	Ma aha sidoo kale.
I felt better at home	Waxaan dareemay inaan si fiican ula joogo guriga
But maybe that was a good thing.	Laakiin malaha taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
This is definitely true.	Tani waa hubaal run.
And for the most part, it is.	Iyo inta badan, waa.
Someone must have told them what had happened.	Waa in qof u sheegay wixii dhacay.
I would love that.	Waan jeclaan lahaa taas.
I am a man with nowhere to go	Waxaan ahay nin aan lahayn meel uu aado
And take it if you are !.	Oo qaado haddii aad tahay!.
I could not leave work.	Waan ka bixi waayay shaqada.
It doesn't matter now.	Hadda waxba maaha.
I hope we get better here	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkan ku fiicnaan doono
I do not know him	Ma garanayo isaga
It is not a lie.	Been maaha.
I found other things to do	Waxaan helay waxyaabo kale oo aad sameyso
I wonder how she does it	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay u sameyso
I have never seen this before.	Tan hore uma arag.
I will never say that.	Weligay taas ma odhan doono.
I am clearly happy	Si cad ayaan u faraxsanahay
They will no longer be able to do it to you.	Mar dambe ma awoodi doonaan inay kugu sameeyaan.
She would be here now.	Hadda way joogi lahayd halkan.
Just give me a little time.	Kaliya i sii waqti yar.
I wonder where he lives	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka uu ku nool yahay
You can't do much.	Wax badan kama qaban kartid.
Only you will tell	Adiga oo kaliya ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa
No problem, she said.	Dhib malaha, sida ay tidhi.
I had to be friends	Waxay ahayd in aan saaxiib noqdo
I did not think all that had happened before	Uma malaynayn in dhammaan wixii hore u dhacay
He even told us it would happen.	Xitaa wuxuu noo sheegay inay dhici doonto.
I would stay there again.	Mar kale ayaan sii joogi lahaa halkaas.
There was no help for him.	Ma jirin wax caawin ah isaga.
Required	Loo baahan yahay
I thought he was going to see you	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu u baxay inuu ku arko
I didn't want to know.	Maan rabin inaan ogaado.
I had a good day.	Waxaan lahaa maalin wanaagsan.
Not much.	Wax badan ma aha.
I really did not know what to do	Runtii maan garanayn waxaan sameeyo
I hope to know how	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ogaado sida
I want to tell them.	Waxaan rabaa inaan u sheego.
He did, without a hitch.	Wuu sameeyay, dhib la'aan.
I thought I would have time	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan waqti heli doono
But none of us could help him.	Laakiin mid naga mid ah ma caawin karin isaga.
No one would be.	Qofna wuu noqon lahaa.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
I wonder if you will come out today	Waxaan la yaabanahay maanta miyaad soo bixi doontaa
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
It was an exciting time	Waxay ahayd waqti xiiso badan
I want you today	Maanta waan ku rabaa adiga
I hope to see more	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan wax badan arko
It took me a while.	Waqti ayaa la iga qaaday.
I did not think he would see me any other way	Uma malaynayn inuu si kale ii arki doono
I'm sure he'll tell us soon	Waxaan hubaa inuu dhawaan noo sheego
Not quite right, yet.	Wax sax ah maaha, weli.
I am so happy to see you again	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko
Not everyone is able to do that.	Qof walba ma awoodo inuu sidaas sameeyo.
There is only one here.	Waxaa jira kan kaliya halkan.
I would love to have someone taller	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan helo qof aad u dheer
I can get that.	Waan heli karaa taas.
Something he saw.	Wax uu arkay.
I just can't do it	Kaliya ma samayn karo
I made it work for him.	Waxaan ka dhigay inuu u shaqeeyo.
It is accurate and correct.	Waa mid sax ah oo sax ah.
I am not doing this.	Anigu ma samaynayo tan.
There is no truth in him.	Run kuma jirto isaga.
The best.	Waxa ugu wanaagsan.
I think it was probably right	Waxaan filayaa in laga yaabo inay sax ahayd
It was a great place.	Waxay ahayd meel weyn.
found.	helay.
I wonder what it looks like.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay u egtahay.
I decided to tell her later	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan mar dambe u sheego
I can't do it now	Ma awoodin hadda
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
I just want to be myself	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo aniga
I really came back	Runtii waan soo noqday
It may not be right here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan halkan sax ahayn.
I knew it could be found	Waan ogaa in lagu heli karo
But it was much worse.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad uga xun.
I am new	waxaan ahay cusub
I felt abandoned, really	Waxaan dareemay in la iga tagay, run ahaantii
I really like it	Runtii waan jeclahay
It is difficult to tell.	In loo sheego waa adag tahay.
I could not speak or even say what happened	Ma aan hadli karin xitaa ma sheegi karin waxa dhacay
I hope it will be one.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu noqon doono mid.
He knows a lot.	Wax badan ayuu garanayaa.
I must not pay anything other than the best	Waa inaanan bixin wax aan ahayn kan ugu fiican
Now he has done that.	Hadda wuu sameeyay taas.
I wanted to be with you	Waxaan rabay inaan kula joogo
Do not lie to me.	Been ha ii sheegin.
She said she is.	Waxay sheegtay inay tahay.
It was not right.	Wax sax ah ma ahayn.
I was surprised she did so	Waxaan la yaabay inay sidaas samaysay
I wondered how it was done	Waxaan la yaabay sida loo sameeyo
She did more than that.	Waxay samaysay wax ka badan taas.
Everything was taken away from me	Wax walba waa la iga qaaday
You might think.	Waad u malayn kartaa.
I have never done a job	Weligay shaqo maan qaban
I knew he was holding me.	Waan ogaa inuu i haysto.
Please tell me how to do it, if you know.	Fadlan ii sheeg sida loo sameeyo, haddii aad ogtahay.
When it would be right to do so.	Marka ay sax noqon lahayd in sidaas la sameeyo.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
I can do nothing more	Wax dambe ma qaban karo
I will always do.	Had iyo jeer waan sameyn doonaa.
He should never have known that.	Ma aha in uu waligiis taas ogaa.
I did not find anything	Waxba maan helin
Like who you are.	Sida qofka aad tahay.
I want to be the best as always.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo kan ugu fiican sida had iyo jeer.
I think this is something for him only	Waxaan u maleynayaa in tani ay tahay wax isaga kaliya
He seemed to want to talk.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu doonayo inuu hadlo.
He can go as much as he wants.	Inta uu rabo ayuu tagi karaa.
But we cannot be anything other than that.	Laakiin ma noqon karno wax aan taas ahayn mar dambe.
It was a lie.	Been bay ahayd.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
He was very accurate.	Aad buu sax u ahaa.
I do not know what to do	Waxaan samayn lahayn ma garanayn
It’s a bit more.	Waa xoogaa ka sii badan .
She can really afford it.	Runtii way awoodi kartaa.
It is.	Waxa ay tahay.
She couldn't believe it, he said to himself.	Way rumaysan wayday, ayuu is yidhi.
He does the same thing.	Wuxuu sameeyaa isla wax la mid ah.
I found it a long time ago	Waxaan helay wakhti dheer oo dheer ka hor
I never thought of that	Weligay uma malaynayn taas
I really had nothing to say	Runtii maan haysan wax aan sheego
Maybe I don't like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan jeclayn.
Can anyone please help me?	Qofna fadlan ma i caawin karaa.
It is what I need.	Waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
Lots of time and money.	Waqti iyo lacag aad u badan.
He was a good friend once.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib fiican hal mar.
I wanted to talk to you alone	Waxaan rabay inaan keligaa kula hadlo
He was really a great man	Runtii nin weyn buu ahaa
I'm still sorry for him	Wali waan ka xumahay isaga
I told you how it will be	Waxaan kuu sheegay sida ay noqon doonto
I will not stay here for long	Ma sii joogi doono halkan waqti dheer
He would have been there earlier.	Hore ayuu u joogi lahaa.
I was not present for a while	Ma aanan joogin wax yar
But that is correct.	Laakiin taasi waa sax.
No one likes to talk about it.	Qofna ma jecla inuu ka hadlo.
I'm sure you will	Waan hubaa inaad jeclaan doonto
Certainly not today.	Dhab ahaantii maanta maaha.
He was in something.	Wax buu ku jiray.
There is no more.	Ma jiro in ka badan.
I still can't believe it, really.	Wali ma rumaysan karo, runtii.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
I thought it was amazing	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay ahayd yaab
It would be too early.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid hore.
That can happen.	Taasi way dhici kartaa.
I am everywhere at the same time	Waxaan joogaa meel walba isku mar
I really like that	Aad ayaan u jeclahay taas
It was so much more.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
I think it could really be	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dhab ahaantii noqon karo
I do not want to do that again	Ma doonayo inaan taas mar kale sameeyo
Not at all.	Dhammaan ma odhan doono.
Everyone knows others.	Qof kastaa wuu yaqaan dadka kale.
I would think so.	Waxaan u malayn lahaa sidaas.
There is so much we can do here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo aan ku sameyn karno halkan.
Even better take a few.	Xitaa ka sii fiican qaado dhowr.
Really, I really started with nothing.	Runtii, runtii waxaan ka bilaabay waxba.
I really don't see how that is true.	Runtii ma arko sida taasi run tahay.
That sounds like a good idea.	Taasi waxay u egtahay fikrad wanaagsan.
I want to talk to you later	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo ka dib
This is a great opportunity.	Tani waa fursad weyn.
I wish this was not so but it is true	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in tani aysan sidaas ahayn laakiin waa run
I want to be a part of it	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka mid noqdo
I had to do everything	Waxay ahayd inaan wax walba sameeyo
I have to do something	Waa inaan wax sameeyaa
Something is wrong.	Wax aan sax ahayn.
I said nothing.	Waxba kuma odhan.
It's great to have done something similar.	Aad bay u fiican tahay inaad samaysay wax la mid ah.
Something bad happened.	Wax xun baa dhacay.
I would stay there again.	Waxaan sii joogi lahaa halkaas mar kale.
All of him.	Isaga oo dhan.
I need to get something	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax helo
She found out here.	Way ogaatay halkan.
You do not need to know now.	Uma baahnid inaad hadda ogaato.
You told me that yesterday.	Shalay ayaad sidaas ii sheegtay.
I will not lie to you.	Been kuu sheegi maayo.
I just want to go home	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan guriga aado
It is yours.	Adiga ayaa leh.
I have never seen it.	Weligay ma arag.
He was about to get the job.	Waqti ku dhow waxay ahayd inuu shaqada helo.
I was everywhere	Meesha oo dhan ayaan joogay
I was not beautiful.	Ma aan ahayn qurux.
Probably.	Malaha waa.
I knew she would like it	Waan ogaa inay jeclaan lahayd
I thought it was the right thing to do	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax sax ah in la sameeyo
I want you to be here with me	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan ila joogto
He just didn’t want to come to you.	Kaliya ma rabin inuu kuu yimaado.
It wasn’t great.	Ma ahayn mid weyn.
A car is a car.	Baabuur waa baabuur.
I did not have that	Taas maan haysan
I would like to do the same	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo wax la mid ah
I know you can do the same	Waan ogahay inaad sidaas oo kale samayn karto
I would love to see more of this.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ka arko tan.
I really did not want to lie to you	Runtii ma rabin inaan been kuu sheego
I have no idea what it was.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxay ahayd.
I know who you are.	Waan ogahay qofka aad tahay.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
Let it go.	Ha tago.
I never did that at school	Weligay taas dugsiga kuma samayn
Maybe this will help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
He said nothing, but he knew.	Waxba uma sheegin, laakiin wuu ogaa.
It is what they do.	Waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
He wondered what they were.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa ay yihiin.
I could not see anything	Waxba maan arki karin
I can't believe what happened now	Ma rumaysan karo waxa hadda dhacay
I am sure you will do well.	Waxaan hubaa inaad si fiican wax u qaban doonto.
But he was obviously surprised.	Laakiin waxa iska cad in uu la yaabay.
I'm sure you can say a lot about it	Waxaan hubaa inaad wax badan ka sheegi karto
Someone else was in it.	Qof kale ayaa ku jiray.
I wanted to talk about it.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka hadlo.
I love being wanted.	Waxaan jeclahay in la i doonayo.
That may not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon karto.
I should never have come here	Ma ahayn inaan weligay halkan iman
But there was something else, too.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax kale, sidoo kale.
That was for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd hubaal.
It would be good for him.	Way u fiicnaan lahayd isaga.
They are hard to do.	Way ku adag yihiin inay sameeyaan.
I have friends living there	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo halkaas ku nool
More to do.	Wax badan in la sameeyo.
Never, never, never did.	Waligiis, waligiis, waligiis ma samayn.
He did not want to leave.	Ma uusan rabin inuu baxo.
It will not take long.	Wax yar ma qaadan doonto.
I came back again	Mar kale ayaan ku soo noqday
At first I saw you as nothing.	Marka hore waxaan kuu arkay wax aan jirin.
I think that would be great.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd.
I lied to you.	been baan kuu sheegay.
It will not hurt anymore	Dhib dambe ma yeeli doono
He is who you are.	Waa qofka aad tahay.
I didn't see anything, I didn't see anyone.	Waxba ma arag, cidna ma arag.
I was really surprised	Runtii waan la yaabay
And he gets time.	Oo waqti uu helo.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
I did something fast	Wax degdeg ah ayaan u sameeyay
You can go there.	Waxaad tagi kartaa halkaas.
I had to do something	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sameeyo
A few more went out	In yar oo kale ayaa baxay
That does not apply to me.	Taas kuma jiraan aniga.
I have to be able to find out	Waa inaan awoodo inaan ogaado
I would expect to be with you	Waxaan filan lahaa inaan kula joogo
He is unlikely to have time for it now.	Uma badna inuu waqti u helo hadda.
You are happy.	Waad ku faraxsan tahay.
I will not do otherwise.	Si kale ma yeeli doono.
No more.	Ma jiro mar dambe.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.	Malaha maanta maaha, malaha berri maaha.
In fact, he did not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma uusan samayn.
He says don't get married.	Waxa uu ku leeyahay ha is qaadan.
It is invisible.	Waa wax aan la arki karin.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
I could not take anything	Waxba maan qaadan karin
It will be fun as always.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh sida had iyo jeer.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Three is for sure.	Saddex waa hubaal.
You will love it.	Waad jeclaan doontaa.
It should	Waa in
He was not the only one who came out	Ma ahayn ka kaliya ee soo baxay
I'm glad he left you	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu kaa tagay
I have to do it	Waa inaan sameeyo
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
It certainly will.	Waa hubaal inay yeeli doonto.
Can't talk yet.	Wali lama hadli karo.
I know the house.	Waan ogahay guriga.
I haven't done it in a long time	Anigu ma aan samayn muddo dheer
As a matter of fact, just do not.	Sida si dhab ah, kaliya ha samayn.
I you.	Aniga, adiga.
This looks awful.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid xun.
He needs more.	Wax badan ayuu u baahan yahay.
I could not see anything.	Waxba maan arki karin.
You can also do other things.	Waxaad sidoo kale samayn kartaa waxyaabo kale.
As a friend.	Sida saaxiib.
I will stay here.	halkaan ayaan joogi doonaa.
He wants to know if it is true or not.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ogaado inay run tahay iyo in kale.
He said right there.	Isla halkaas ayuu yidhi.
He said it would be good, but he knew.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay noqon doonto mid wanaagsan, laakiin wuu ogyahay.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
Maybe I should tell him now	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u sheego hadda
I am here all the time.	Waxaan joogaa halkan mar walba.
And more than that.	Iyo wax ka badan oo tan.
You should have been there.	Waxay ahayd inaad halkaas joogto.
They are clear.	Way cad yihiin.
I can't see it, just me	Kuma arki karo, aniga kaliya
She looks like him.	Waxay u egtahay isaga.
I hope it will get better.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sii fiicnaan doonto.
I have everything	Wax walba waan hayaa
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
He had few friends there.	Waxa uu lahaa saaxiibo yar halkaas.
I really did not want to go home	Runtii ma rabin inaan guriga aado
He did not tell anyone	Cidna uma sheegin
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
Not sure if he knows	Ma hubo inuu garanayo
I did not know that would happen	Maan ogayn inay taasi dhici doonto
One is obvious.	Mid waa cad yahay.
I still had to help	Weli waxay ahayd inaan caawiyo
It is very difficult.	Waa mid aad u adag.
As it will do again.	Sida ay mar kale yeeli doonto.
I am sure this will now do the job.	Waxaan hubaa in tani ay hadda qaban doonto shaqada.
Maybe it would have been better if he had stayed.	Ma laga yaabaa inay fiicnaan lahayd haddii uu joogi lahaa.
You know you would love to tell us.	Waad ogtahay inaad jeceshahay inaad noo sheegto.
There really aren't.	Runtii ma jiraan.
I never got a chance to pick it up again	Mar dambe ma helin fursad aan ku soo qaado
That's how it was set.	Sidaas ayaa loo dhigay.
I really want to know	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
I heard everything beautiful	Waxaan maqlay wax walba oo qurux badan
He was a beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan buu ahaa.
I wish it would have ended differently.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay si kale ku dhammaan lahayd.
I hope they never stop you from doing this	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan mar dambe kaa joojin inaad tan sameyso
I need an appointment from you	Waxaan kaa rabaa ballan
I still wonder	Weli waan yaabay
For the most part, that is.	Inta badan, taasi waa.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
He is now a young man.	Hadda waa nin yar.
He just couldn't.	Kaliya wuu awoodi waayay.
No one was to say anything.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu wax sheego.
I should not have left	Ma ahayn inaan baxo
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
That is what they should do.	Taasi waa inay sameeyaan.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
You may be one of us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad naga mid tahay.
I need him	waan u baahanahay isaga
I have been with you for a long time	Waxaan kula joogay muddo dheer
I know all this	Taas oo dhan waan ogahay
I'm sure you do.	Waan hubaa inaad samaynayso.
You do not always have to tell me what to do.	Uma baahnid inaan mar walba kuu sheego waxaad samaynayso.
I do not get it.	ma helo.
You will not get a job.	Shaqo kuma heli doonto.
But he never does.	Laakiin waligiis ma sameeyo.
I really did not know why	Runtii ma garanayn sababta
Maybe you were like me a lot.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad aniga oo kale ahayd wax badan.
That was a huge surprise.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab aad u weyn.
I can help you with that.	Waan kaa caawin karaa taas.
But not him.	Laakiin isaga maaha.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
I can't believe you will do this to me	Ma rumaysan karo inaad tan igu samayn doonto
I just want to get it right	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan si sax ah u helo
I may not like it at all, but that's fine	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan waxba ka helin, laakiin taasi waa fiican tahay
He did.	Waxa uu sameeyay.
Not very smart.	Ma aha mid aad u caqli badan.
Don't want someone like that.	Ha rabin qof sidaas oo kale ah.
I'm happy, but not everything	Waan ku faraxsanahay, laakiin maaha wax walba
It won't be much.	Wax badan ma noqon doonto.
I have been like this for a long time	Waxaan sidaas ahaa muddo dheer
I think he knew better	Waxaan filayaa inuu si fiican u ogaa
It will not stop anything	Waxba kama joojin doono
They love it.	Way jecel yihiin.
See it here, here and here.	Halkan ka arag, halkan iyo halkan.
We can not stop.	Ma joojin karno.
I was a person	Waxaan ahaa qof
I had a real friend	Waxaan lahaa saaxiib dhab ah
I am usually at home now	Inta badan waxaan joogaa guriga hadda
I'm sure she will like it	Waan hubaa inay jeclaan doonto
I haven't spoken in a while	In muddo ah lama aan hadlin
Many lies.	Been badan.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
I made a promise	Ballan baan qaaday
I told him no.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay jirin.
Most did not lie.	Inta badan been ma sheegin.
Not in the same place.	Isku meel maaha.
But this.	Laakiin kan.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I just can't find a job	Kaliya shaqo ma heli karo
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma helin.
But it should.	Laakiin waa in ay.
He looked younger than me.	Wuxuu ii muuqday mid iga yar.
He refused to go.	Wuu diiday inuu tago.
Everywhere and everyone.	Meel kasta iyo qof kasta.
I hope it is real.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhab tahay.
You can go out and see yourself.	Waad bixi kartaa oo is arki kartaa.
I thought it was really amazing.	Waxaan mooday inay runtii yaab lahayd.
I was very impressed with that	Taas aad baan ula dhacay
I'm just happy to be a part of it.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ka mid noqdo.
It's a good place to be.	Waa meel fiican oo sax ah.
I have never done that before	Weligay taas ka hor ma samayn
I think there are several.	Waxaan filayaa inay jiraan dhowr.
I can't do this.	Ma samayn karo tan.
Here's how you can do the same.	Waa kan sida aad sidoo kale u samayn karto.
I know now.	Waan ogahay hadda.
Three.	Saddex.
Not either.	Ma aha sidoo kale.
I can't do that here	Taas halkan kuma samayn karo
This is how it is done.	Tani waa sida loo sameeyo.
I think you really need it	Waxaan filayaa inaad runtii u baahan tahay
He came up with something.	Wax buu la yimid.
I have another to do today	Waxaan hayaa mid kale oo aan sameeyo maanta
I had to say.	Waxay ahayd inaan sheego.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
I may not want it to exist but it does.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan rabin inuu jiro laakiin wuu sameeyaa.
I definitely got it	Hubaal waan ku helay
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
You think it is real.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inay dhab tahay.
Must be required.	Waa in loo baahan yahay.
I knew it would come.	Waan ogaa inay iman doonto.
I need to get out	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka baxo
A lot is going on right now	Wax badan baa hadda socda
She is younger than him.	Way ka yar tahay isaga.
I love you, I love you.	I jecel, ima jecla.
I can not do it.	Ma samayn karo.
I can't see anything.	Waxba ma arko.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
I was lucky with that.	Nasiib baan ku lahaa taas.
I will not be part of it	Anigu ka mid noqon maayo
I really want to do that.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan taas sameeyo.
Maybe I should say it again	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar kale sheego
I really can't talk about that	Runtii taas kama hadli karo
I love everyone here	Waan jeclahay qof walba halkan
I wanted to see it again	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale arko
He is an amazing man.	Waa nin yaab leh.
I think both are true	Waxaan filayaa in labaduba run yihiin
I have not yet had the good fortune to work on this.	Weli nasiib badan uma helin inaan tan ku shaqeeyo.
That there is a very tough guy.	In uu jiro nin aad u adag.
And maybe they make money from it.	Oo laga yaabo inay lacag ka sameeyaan.
It is the job of each and every one of us.	Waa shaqo qof walba oo naga mid ah.
But tell me what.	Laakiin kuu sheeg waxa.
would like.	jeclaan lahaa.
Not too much.	Aad uma badna.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
She’s not very happy when she doesn’t have it.	Ma aha mid aad u faraxsan marka aysan haysan.
But, and big, but, it will happen.	Laakiin, oo waa weyn, laakiin, way dhici doontaa.
She is very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
She will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayso.
I will help you	waan ku caawin doonaa
He said nothing to me	Waxba igama odhan
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
I still have a place	Weli meel baan ku hayaa
I am happy to help.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan caawiyo.
Probably right.	Malaha waa sax.
I think he knows something	Waxaan filayaa inuu wax garanayo
I can't talk to him	Kama hadli karo isaga
Both, he said to himself.	Labaduba, ayuu is yidhi.
I was not one of them	Anigu ka mid ma ahayn
I thought it was with us.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay nagu jirto.
You can not tell.	Ma sheegi kartid.
But I can't lie.	Laakiin been uma sheegi karo.
I wanted to get out of here	Waxaan rabay inaan halkan ka baxo
There is no job without it.	Ma jiro wax shaqo ah oo aan lahayn halkaas.
I have to do this.	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa.
She lied to him.	Been bay u sheegtay.
I know what you told me	Waan ogahay waxaad ii sheegtay
I knew what she was doing	Waan ogaa waxa ay samaynayso
And how he got home.	Iyo sidii uu guriga ku yimid.
Who.	Tani.
But there is something.	Laakiin wax baa jira.
I want to know what happened here	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa halkan ka dhacay
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ahayn.
It may be too fast.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay mid aad u degdeg badan.
Maybe too, one day	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale, maalin
Now he would come home from work.	Hadda ayuu shaqada ka iman lahaa.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
I had a good time, too	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay, sidoo kale
That was correct.	Taasi waxay ahayd sax.
I need to know if it is true	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inay run tahay
That did not come true	Taasi run uma helin
I would definitely stop	Hubaal waan joojin lahaa
Not only that, but that's what it is.	Ma aha oo kaliya, laakiin waa waxa ay tahay.
That should not be too difficult.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
I need to talk to him about work	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kala hadlo shaqo
It can not be.	Ma noqon karto.
I will never do that, a lie like that	Weligay sidaas ma yeeli doono, been sidaas oo kale ah
I can tell you more tomorrow	Berri wax badan ayaan u sheegi karaa
I can't see why that would be.	Ma arki karo sababta ay taasi noqon doonto.
I did the same but I put it off	Si la mid ah ayaan sameeyay laakiin dib ayaan u dhigay
He never did.	Waligiis ma samayn.
There is nothing else you can do.	Wax kale oo aad u qaban lahayd ma jiraan.
It would help a lot.	Wax badan bay caawin lahayd.
It will help you a lot.	Wax badan bay ku caawin doontaa.
I may even have been like that for a while.	Xitaa waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidaas ku sii jiray muddo.
In fact, very good.	Dhab ahaantii, aad u fiican.
I know this is not always the case	Waan ogahay in tani aysan mar walba ahayn sida ay tahay
He didn't need to see this.	Uma baahnayn inuu tan arko.
I know this is the best thing for me.	Waan ogahay in tani ay tahay waxa ugu fiican aniga.
Something bad.	Wax xun.
I can't come back now	Hadda kuma soo noqon karo
This is the one I don't want here.	Waa kan aan halkan ku rabin.
I'm sure she did.	Waan hubaa inay samaysay.
Maybe I can get him.	Malaha waan heli karaa isaga.
We are lucky and lucky.	Waxaan nahay nasiib iyo nasiib.
I know it's too long.	Waan ogahay inay aad u dheer tahay.
I need to get out of there	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas ka baxo
I became right	Waxaan noqday sax
That is good to know.	Taasi waa wax fiican in la ogaado.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan lahayd
I would do it again	Mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa
There is no problem.	Dhibaato ma jiraan.
But it is not as surprising as this.	Laakiin maaha sida tan oo kale la yaab leh.
I hope you had the same	Waxaan filayaa inaad sidaas oo kale lahayd
An emergency food place is nearby	Meel cunto degdeg ah ayaa u dhow
I felt that this needed him	Waxa aan dareemay in tani ay u baahan tahay isaga
Obviously, she will be able to tell you where that is.	Sida cad, waxay awoodi doontaa inay kuu sheegto meesha ay taasi jirto.
I was surprised she would let me	Waxaan la yaabay inay ii ogolaan doonto
I'm sure he would.	Waan hubaa inuu yeeli lahaa.
But there is more here.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan halkan.
I did not know what was going on	Ma garanayn waxa socda
She had no idea she would be leaving soon.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay aadi lahayd dhawaan.
He hurried out the door.	Si degdeg ah ayuu albaabka uga soo baxay.
I just want to leave	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
She would stay home.	Waxay joogi lahayd guriga.
She really did.	Dhab ahaantii way samaysay.
All of him.	Isaga oo dhan.
I have seen everything you have done	Waxa aan arkay wax kasta oo aad samaysay
There is no way to know who she is.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado cidda ay tahay.
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
I saw what happened	Waxaan arkay waxa ku dhacay
I really like how difficult it is	Aad ayaan u jeclahay sida ay u adag tahay
Let me know if you want to.	Sii sheeg haddii aad rabto.
This is what they do.	Tani waa waxa ay u sameeyaan.
Why did you do it.	Maxaad u samaysay.
I have a job for you	shaqo baan kuu hayaa
And close.	Oo u dhow.
I think she does.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay sameyso.
That is what is often done.	Taasi waa waxa inta badan la sameeyo.
I need as much as you can give me	Waxaan u baahanahay inta aad i siin karto
He was in this, after all.	Waxa uu ku jiray tan, ka dib oo dhan.
I think you did, really	Waxaan filayaa inaad samaysay, run ahaantii
I haven't been there in a while	In muddo ah maan tagin
He really is.	Runtii wuu yahay.
I need to go there	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago meesha
I do not want to eat anywhere else	Ma doonayo inaan meel kale ku cuno
I always thought it was familiar	Waxaan had iyo jeer u maleeyay in la yaqaan
He is still a man.	Wali waa nin.
I did not want to leave anyone who knew me like that.	Maan rabin inaan ka tago qof sidaas igu yaqaan.
I don't want that.	Ma rabo taas.
He left immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayuu meesha uga soo baxay.
I have powers that you do not believe	Waxaan leeyahay awoodo aadan rumaysan doonin
Do the hard work.	Qabo shaqada adag.
Do not talk to anyone.	Cidna ha la hadlin.
It does not look like anything new	Wax cusub uma eka
I did not want to leave anyone.	Ma rabin inaan cidna ka tago.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
I think it will be.	Waxaan filayaa inay noqon doonto.
I returned years ago	Waxaan noqday sano ka hor
I just need a little more time	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay waqti yar
It could not be stopped.	Waa la joojin waayay.
I knew I would never see him again	Waan ogaa inaanan dib u arki doonin isaga
In fact, maybe.	Dhab ahaantii, malaha.
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
I can do that for you	Taas waan kuu samayn karaa
Who knows where it will go.	Meesha ay ka bixi doonto yaa yaqaan.
I didn’t think it was that hard really	Uma malaynayn inay sidaas u adag tahay runtii
It won't be long	Waqti dheer ma tagi doono
I can't see anything.	Waxba kuma arki karo.
It is nothing new.	Wax cusub maaha.
I can do the job quickly	Shaqada si degdeg ah ayaan u samayn karaa
It is everything.	Waa wax walba.
I would definitely be here again.	Dhab ahaantii halkan mar kale ayaan joogi lahaa.
You can do anything.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta.
I have told you many things.	Wax badan baan kuu sheegay.
I knew nothing.	Waxba maan garanayn.
so I was.	sidaas ayaan ahaa.
She had many friends.	Waxay lahayd saaxiibo badan.
One would fall.	Mid ku dhici lahaa.
But really, it is not.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, maaha.
It is really a lie.	Runtii waa been.
I really can't lie	Runtii been ma sheegi karo
I just knew he would do it	Kaliya waan ogaa inuu sameyn doono
He did not get it.	Ma uu helin.
And I do not know how to work it out.	Oo anigu ma garanayo si aan ugu shaqeeyo.
I did not like what he was doing	Maan jeclayn waxa uu samaynayo
Maybe it was.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd.
It’s me and you, right now.	Waa aniga iyo adiga, hadda.
It is where you are now.	Waa meesha aad hadda joogto.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
I did not want to see	Ma aanan rabin inaan arko
I know it looks amazing	Waan ogahay inay u egtahay wax yaab leh
I think he saw something he did not tell me	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu arkay wax uusan ii sheegin
I hope it doesn't take long	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan waqti badan qaadan
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii waan ka helay.
You are a regular.	Waxaad tahay mid joogto ah.
But it was a lie.	Laakiin been bay ahayd.
The best.	Tan ugu fiican.
big and small.	weyn iyo wax yar.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiro.
It looks like someone is really living here right now.	Waxay u egtahay in qof runtii halkan ku nool yahay hadda.
I may not already have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan hore u haysan.
You have not done anything about it.	Ma aadan waxba ka qaban arrintan.
They did not give time.	Waqti ma ay siin.
Three were found.	Saddex ayaa la helay.
I can only do something about it now	Waxa kaliya oo aan wax ka qaban karaa hadda
I can't believe you haven't seen it here	Ma rumaysan karo inaadan halkan ku arag
I did the right thing	Wax sax ah ayaan sameeyay
It's really hard.	Runtii aad bay u adag tahay.
He was unstoppable.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aan la joojin karin.
I have to do this	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa
I want to know everything that is going on	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wax kasta oo socda
I thought it was a bad thing	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax xun
I heard that.	Taas waan maqlay.
I really did not understand anything	Runtii waxba maan fahmin
he is with us.	wuu nala joogaa.
Do not leave anything out.	Waxba ha ka tagin.
Now I am afraid of you	Hadda waan kaa baqayaa
No money received.	Lacag lama helin.
Maybe that was bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ay ahayd mid xun.
I still look very small	Weli waxaan u muuqdaa mid aad u yar
He knows that, but he does not know how.	Taas wuu garanayaa, laakiin ma garanayo sida uu u garanayo.
I wonder why that is, right now.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta ay taasi tahay, hadda.
Something you have to do for me.	Wax ay tahay inaad ii sameyso.
A few times in fact	Dhowr jeer dhab ahaantii
I do not see that anything can be done now.	Ma arko in hadda wax la qaban karo.
But that may not be right.	Laakiin taasi sax ma noqon karto.
Not sure what to do	Ma hubo waxa aan sameeyo
I think everyone is ready to come home.	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu diyaar u yahay inuu guriga yimaado.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I can tell he still doesn't believe me	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inuusan weli i rumaysan
They are close.	Way isku dhow yihiin.
I told you it was	Waxaan kuu sheegay waxay ahayd
But enough for me.	Laakiin igu filan aniga.
I have a lot to offer him	Wax badan ayaan u hayaa isaga
Maybe he wants to see it, maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu rabo inuu arko, malaha.
He had no idea what was in it.	Wax fikrad ah kama uusan lahayn waxa ku jira.
I can tell you it is as you say	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa inay tahay sida aad sheegtay
I would expect a man	Waxaan filan lahaa nin
He disappeared.	Wuu waayay.
Nothing so great.	Wax sidaas u weyn maaha.
Beauty is enough for me.	Qurux bay igu filan tahay.
He knew what would happen.	Wuu ogaa waxa dhici doona.
I did not think he had said that before	Uma malaynayn inuu sidaas oo kale hore u yidhi
But no one really knew what it was.	Laakiin qofna si sax ah uma ogayn waxa uu ahaa.
I will do it	waan samayn doonaa
I can talk to anyone	Qofna waan la hadli karaa
I have been here a long time	Waxaan joogay muddo dheer
I can't be.	Ma noqon karo.
I will never get enough of it	Weligay ma heli doono wax igu filan
I knew what was going on.	Waan ogaa waxa ku socda.
I thought it was awful.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ahayd mid aad u xun.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan.
I am here only to help you	Waxaan halkaan u joogaa inaan ku caawiyo oo kaliya
I would love to see that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko taas.
It will take the work of the people.	Waxay qaadan doontaa shaqada dadka.
I do not know where it would come from	Ma garanayo meel ay ka iman lahayd
There is no time.	Waqti kuma jiro.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
I think it can happen	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici karto
I never took the time to do that	Weligay wakhti kuma qaadan inaan taas sameeyo
I looked back.	Dib baan u eegay.
I do not know how she did it, but she did.	Ma garanayo sida ay u samaysay, laakiin way samaysay.
You need to know what you are doing.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxaad samaynayso.
So far he hasn’t had it.	Ilaa hadda ma uusan haysan.
I do not like anything better	Ma jecli wax ka fiican
It was taken from me	Waa la ii qaatay
I just need to see you first	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko marka hore
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Let me buy one.	Aan ku iibsado mid.
I really didn't even want to	Runtii xitaa ma rabin
I have other things to do	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo kale oo aan sameeyo
I really do not know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
He is not alone.	Keligiis maaha.
Not available.	Lama heli karo.
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
I think that's a good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan
He just said nothing	Kaliya waxba ma odhan
How great is that.	Sidee u weyn taas.
I looked up	Waxaan eegay meel dhow
That is the main reason.	Taasi waa sababta ugu weyn.
This is how things are.	Tani waa sida ay wax yihiin.
No one knows this.	Qofna ma garanayo tan.
I can't do anything else	Wax kale ma samayn karo
I looked but saw nothing.	Waan eegay laakiin waxba ma arag.
There, there is enough for everyone.	Waxaa jira, waxaa jira ku filan qof kasta.
I hope she does the same for you	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas oo kale kuu sameyso
I love you and I want to be with you	waan ku jeclahay oo waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo
It’s like I’m there again.	Waxay la mid tahay inaan mar kale halkaas joogo.
But she loves him.	Laakiin way jeceshahay isaga.
He said he wanted to talk.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu rabo inuu hadlo.
It is not.	Ma aha.
I had to face the new one	Waxay ahayd inaan ka hor tago kan cusub
I know this	Tan aniga waan ogahay
I did the right thing	Waxaan sameeyay wax sax ah
I was not a great friend	Maan ahayn saaxiib weyn
Like tomorrow it would be better	Sida berrito way fiicnaan lahayd
I think he does not like me	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuusan i jeclayn
I know you can do this	Waan ogahay inaad tan samayn karto
He's gone now.	Hadda ayuu baxay .
I can withdraw	Waan ka noqon karaa
Someone did that.	Qof baa taas sameeyay.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I refused.	waan diiday.
I have not done a very good job	Ma aanan qaban shaqo aad u wanaagsan
You are happy.	Waad ku faraxsan tahay.
There is no luck so far.	Nasiib ma jiro ilaa hadda.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
It is not a good thing to do.	Maaha in wax wanaagsan la sameeyo.
I'm sorry, old friend	waan ka xumahay saaxiib hore
I think that's very good.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi aad u wanaagsan tahay.
I would like more than anything	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in ka badan wax kasta
It really is a great place	Runtii waa meel aad u fiican
I really can't say much about that	Runtii taas wax badan kama odhan karo
I had to tell her.	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego.
But he was not even interested.	Laakiin xitaa xiiso ma lahayn.
That may, of course.	Taas ayaa laga yaabaa, dhab ahaan.
They still exist.	Wali waa ay jiraan.
I had to have good things.	Waxay ahayd inaan haysto waxyaabo fiican.
I told you they would get it again	Waxaan kuu sheegay inay mar kale ku heli doonaan
I just did not know how he would do it	Kaliya ma aan garanayn sida uu u samayn doono
I thought you were someone else	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay qof kale
I want to know what happened	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
I have a problem here	halkaan dhibaato ayaan ku qabaa
I have an appointment in advance	Waxaan leeyahay ballan hore
I think it made me work harder.	Waxaan filayaa inuu iga dhigay inaan si adag u shaqeeyo.
In fact, there was.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa jiray.
Don't take it for granted.	Ha u qaadan inay tahay.
I have food for you	Cunto ayaan kuu hayaa
It may not be you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan adiga ahayn.
You are too much otherwise	Aad baad u badan tahay haddii kale
I will only get one chance	Hal fursad oo kaliya ayaan heli doonaa
I wanted to be left alone	Waxaan rabay in la iga tago
I think someone else	Waxaan qabaa qof kale
I did not want anyone to know	Ma aanan rabin in qofna ogaado
Maybe I can work tonight	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan shaqeeyo caawa
What he says is.	Waxa uu leeyahay waa.
I had enough	Wax igu filan ayaan lahaa
But you did what you had to do.	Laakiin waxaad samaysay wixii aad lahayd inaad samayso.
Maybe he won't come back either.	Malaha sidoo kale soo noqon maayo.
I know how it is	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay
He found me.	Wuu iga helay.
But busy again.	Laakiin mar kale mashquul.
Not like anything else.	Ma aha sida wax kale.
I just want this to be done	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in tan la sameeyo
! 	!
I need something else	Wax kale ayaan u baahanahay
He wants something.	Wax buu rabaa.
I seem to see him as another man.	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaan u arko nin kale.
It can break up.	Way kala tagi kartaa.
You may not be able to pay much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan wax badan bixin karin.
If you do, expect to do it more than once.	Haddii aad sameyso, filan inaad sameyso wax ka badan hal mar.
Only one.	Kaliya hal.
I have to find out tomorrow	Waa inaan ogaado berrito
I know you will do your best	Waan ogahay inaad samayn doonto waxa ugu fiican
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
I'm not really sure about this	Runtii aad uma hubo arrintan
I think a lot about that.	Wax badan ayaan ka qabaa taas.
Any time.	Waqti kasta.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I told him what had happened	Waxaan u sheegay wixii dhacay
I spent a lot of money on you	Lacag badan ayaan kugu qaatay
I withdrew from this.	Dib ayaan uga noqday arrintan.
I knew I would never see him again.	Waan ogaa inaanan dib u arki doonin isaga.
It’s not fun, either.	Ma aha mid xiiso leh, sidoo kale.
I didn't even know that	Xitaa taas maan ogeyn
I could not get out of there	Halkaas ayaan uga bixi waayay
I can not do the latter	Tan dambe ma samayn karo
As if it really didn't exist.	Sida haddii aysan run ahaantii jirin.
I did not have enough time	Waqti igu filan ma helin
I hope it will happen.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici doonto.
I hope it is more than that.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay taasi ka badan tahay.
I will not say it again.	Mar dambe ma odhan doono.
Do not say anything to anyone.	Cidna waxba ha ku odhan.
Another man is wanted.	Nin kale ayaa la rabaa.
I want to talk to him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo
I wanted to see how it was	Waxaan rabay inaan arko sida ay tahay
But this is not really true.	Laakiin tani runtii sax maaha.
Really interesting.	Dhab ahaantii xiiso leh.
Not sure how long it was, really.	Ma hubo inta ay ahayd, dhab ahaantii.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
I didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inaan sameeyo.
I can't believe what he said	Ma rumaysan karo waxa uu ku yidhi
It was wanted.	Waa la rabay.
I just want to talk about it.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo.
I think that is great	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay mid weyn
That's fine.	Taasi waa iska fiican tahay.
She was an old friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib hore.
I just didn't like it	Kaliya maan jeclayn
This was a lot of work.	Tani waxay ahayd shaqo badan.
We would not allow it.	Uma ogolaan lahayn.
Not what it is.	Ma aha waxa ay tahay.
I do not know exactly why.	Si sax ah uma garanayo sababta.
After a while, he left	Wax yar ka dib, wuu baxay
But it will, after all.	Laakiin way yeeli doontaa, ka dib.
It was not too bad.	Wax aad u xun ma ahayn.
I had to tell someone.	Waxay ahayd inaan qof u sheego.
I do not think that is true	U malayn maayo in taasi run tahay
I did not know they would do it	Maan ogayn inay samayn doonaan
I know what you need	Waan ogahay waxaad u baahan tahay
I can't believe it's true	Ma rumaysan karo inay run tahay
New here.	Ku cusub halkan.
The next one !.	Soo socda soo socda!.
This is too much.	Tani waa mid aad u badan.
I had to leave here.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkan ka baxo.
It's a little smaller here.	Way ka yara yar tahay halkan.
No problem.	Dhib ma arag.
She just didn't want to.	Kaliya ma ay rabin.
That is fine.	Taasi waa si fiican.
I have to know that this will happen	Waa inaan ogaado inay tani dhici doonto
I also need something else	Waxaan sidoo kale u baahanahay wax kale
I started again.	Mar kale ayaan bilaabay.
That is.	Taasi waa.
I went ahead.	Hore ayaan u baxay.
I do not know how to get out of it	Ma garanayo sida uu uga baxo
I want to know where it all ends	Waxa aan rabaa in aan ogaado halka ay ku dhan tahay
I know it's good for me	Waan ogahay inay ii fiican tahay
He seemed unwanted.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aan rabin.
I wanted to talk to someone else	Waxaan rabay inaan qof kale la hadlo
It should not be talked about.	Waa in aan la hadlin.
This is what you have.	Tani waa waxa aad leedahay.
I knew this was too good to be true	Waan ogaa in tani ay aad u wanaagsan tahay in aan run noqdo
Much has been said so far.	Hadda wax badan baa laga soo sheegay.
Available but very unavailable.	La heli karo laakiin aad lama heli karo.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
I do not have to find out	Ma hayo si aan wax ku ogaado
I would like to know where you are.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan ogaado meesha aad joogto.
I know what it looks like	Waan ogahay sida ay u egtahay
I looked at the door	Albaabka ayaan eegay
I still hold you tonight	Weli waan ku hayaa caawa
He had a friend once.	Waxa uu lahaa saaxiib hal mar.
That was not a bad idea.	Taasi ma ahayn fikrad xun.
I had to pick you up	Waxay ahayd inaan ku soo qaado
Even more so.	Xitaa ka sii badan.
I can't stay here anymore	Ma sii joogi karo halkan mar dambe
Too much, really.	Aad u badan, runtii.
I have always been a bit like that	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa xoogaa sidaas oo kale ah
But only there.	Laakiin halkaas oo kaliya.
That is something new.	Taasi waa wax cusub.
In fact everything can be found there.	Dhab ahaantii wax kasta ayaa laga yaabaa in laga helo halkaas.
I will not lie.	Been sheegi maayo.
I should not have it now	Ma ahayn inaan hadda haysto
Very bad job	Shaqo aad u xun
It was a great idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad aad u fiican.
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
I will not say anything else	Wax kale ma odhan doono
I would not be with someone like that	Ma la joogi lahaa qof sidaas oo kale ah
I will not talk about it.	Ma ka hadlin doono.
I knew I would never go back	Waxaan ogaa inaan dib loo noqon doonin
This was bad.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xun.
You have done this before.	Tan hore ayaad u samaysay.
People came from everywhere	Dadka ayaa meel walba ka yimid
I should have lied.	Waxay ahayd inaan been u sheego.
I do not know why that is.	Ma garanayo sababta taasi tahay.
That would be a good thing to do.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd waxa wanaagsan in la sameeyo.
I hope you know that	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas ogtahay
He could not find it.	Waa uu heli waayay.
I'm sure I tried.	Waxaan hubaa inaan isku dayay.
I found you	waan ku helay
Another day.	Maalin kale.
I'm sure you will	Waan hubaa inaad heli doonto
You can do this here.	Waxaad taas ka samayn kartaa halkan.
I felt the same way about him	Waxaan dareemay si la mid ah isaga
But that may not be right.	Laakiin taasi sax ma noqon karto.
Everyone wants something.	Qof kastaa wax buu rabaa.
I just have to do it	Kaliya waa inaan sameeyo
All at once.	Dhammaan hal mar.
I am happy for you.	Waan kugu faraxsanahay.
I could not do it for him	Ma yeeli karin isaga
I can't say you will	Ma odhan karo waad yeeli doontaa
At first I could not find you	Markii hore waa aan ku heli waayay
I was taken by car to a place	Baabuur ayaa la igu qaaday meel
I was not able to know who she was.	Maan awoodin inaan ogaado cidda ay ahayd.
I have tried it more than once.	Waxaan isku dayay in ka badan hal mar.
I was with him every day	Waxaan la joogay maalin walba
I wish everyone could see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in qof walba uu arki karo
Big money making big money.	Lacag weyn samaynta lacag weyn.
I wanted to be with him	Waxaan rabay inaan la joogo
I'm afraid to go home	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan guriga aado
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
I thought this was a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay tahay fikrad fiican.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
Now she would stop that.	Hadda way joojin lahayd taas.
I was not harmed.	Ima yeeli jirin.
He is a great man.	Waa qof weyn oo weyn.
They love me back.	Waxay i jecel yihiin dib.
Only one chance.	Hal fursad oo kaliya.
She would stay here.	Way joogi lahayd halkan.
Where he should have been.	Meesha ay ahayd inuu joogo.
I really want to get a better job	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan helo shaqo ka fiican
I will give it to you	waan ku siin doonaa
I looked before but saw nothing	Hore ayaan u eegay laakiin waxba ma arag
He took it.	Wuu qaatay.
What did you do?	Maxaad samaysay.
Maybe I told him	Malaha waan u sheegay
Like me.	Aniga oo kale.
I need you to do this	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad tan sameyso
Not just people older than me.	Ma ahan kaliya dadka iga weyn.
That's good for us !.	Taasi waa nagu fiican tahay!.
I think she would like that	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas jeclaan lahayd
I will not do anything else	Wax kale ma samaynayo
I haven't seen it here, yet	Halkan kuma aan arag, weli
I will do it	waan samayn doonaa
But something is new.	Laakiin wax waa cusub.
I am here today	ilaa maanta waan joogaa
Obviously I still haven't found anything	Sida cad weli waxba maan helin
i sax.	i sax .
This is a very difficult problem.	Tani waa dhibaato aad u adag.
I think that was it	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd
I just need to.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay.
First of all, they are very big.	Marka hore, aad bay u weyn yihiin.
I really saw it	Runtii aad baan u arkay
I couldn't believe he took it	Waan rumaysan waayay wuu qaatay
I don’t think one was.	Uma maleynayo in mid ka mid ah uu ahaa.
Whenever someone comes out.	Mar kasta oo qof u soo baxo.
We do not do it now.	Hadda ma samayno.
I love you as much as you know	Aad baan kuu jeclahay inta aad ogtahay
not ready	diyaar uma aha
Hold for a while.	Qabo in muddo ah.
Few did, really.	In yar ayaa sameeyay, runtii.
I hope to see you here soon !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkan mar dhow!.
I am here to help	Waxaan halkaan u joogaa inaan ku caawiyo
I am not at home.	Anigu ma joogo guriga.
I hope this can help	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto
I think you will help there again	Waxaan u maleynayaa in aad mar kale halkaas ku caawin doonto
Let me see.	Aan arko.
I was right there, very close	Waxaan ahaa sax halkaas, aad u dhow
Now that everyone has it, maybe not much.	Hadda oo qof kastaa haysto, malaha wax badan maaha.
But you were like that.	Laakiin sidaas oo kale ayaad ahayd.
I wondered how it really was	Waxaan la yaabay sida uu runtii yahay
I can be a good man for you.	Waxaan kuu noqon karaa nin wanaagsan.
He was a good man at heart.	Nin wanaagsan oo meesha uu joogo ayuu ahaa.
After a while, he came back	Wax yar ka dib, dib buu u soo noqday
I know they won't.	Waan ogahay in aysan yeeli doonin.
But, you can't find anything.	Laakiin, waxba kama heli kartid wax.
I really wanted to see you today	Waxaan runtii rabay inaan maanta ku arko
I think you have to say that	Waxaan filayaa in sidaas aad u leedahay
I'm afraid of that, really	Taas waan ka baqayaa, runtii
You need to know more about it.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad wax badan ka ogaato.
That is not much.	Taasi ma badna.
I had to leave early	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore ka tago
I looked at what he did	Waxa aan eegay waxa uu sameeyay
But it would not be long.	Laakiin muddo dheer ma ay ahaan lahayd.
Not first.	Maaha marka hore.
Don't tell anyone.	Cidna ha u sheegin.
That is, he did.	Taas oo ah in uu sameeyay.
No one had it.	Qofna ma haysan.
I had to tell her.	Waxay ahayd inaan u sheego.
Now you can do the same.	Hadda waxaad samayn kartaa sidaas oo kale.
I also had no idea what was here	Sidoo kale wax fikrad ah kama helin waxa halkan ahaa
Really, this is something you only need to do once.	Runtii, tani waa wax aad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso hal mar.
She certainly does.	Waa hubaal inay samaynayso.
Nothing more now.	Wax hadda ka badan maaha.
We wish they weren't there.	Waxaan jeclaan lahayn inaysan meesha joogin.
There is nothing else we can do.	Wax kale oo aan sameyn karno ma jiraan.
In fact, no one really does.	Dhab ahaantii, qofna runtii ma sameeyo.
I know what he tried	Waan ogahay waxa uu isku dayay
I don't know much.	Wax badan ma garanayo.
I have to find out more about that often	Waa inaan taas ka sii ogaado inta badan
You also need luck.	Waxaad sidoo kale u baahan tahay nasiib.
Not everyone is like you.	Qof walba adiga oo kale maaha.
There was not enough time.	Ma jirin waqti ku filan.
I had to stay for him	Waxay ahayd inaan u joogo isaga
I just want to get something to eat	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan helo wax aan cuno
I did not want to talk to him	Ma aanan rabin in aan la hadlo
No time required.	Wax waqti u baahan.
The same is true for you.	Sidaas oo kale ayaa adiga kugu ah.
I wish you were there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkaas joogi lahayd
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
This was not.	Tani ma ahayn.
I really have to see someone	Runtii waa inaan qof arko
She should know.	Waa inay ogaato.
I hope he does	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameeyo
I think you would be fine	Waxaan filayaa inaad fiicnaan lahayd
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
It can't be what he wants	Ma noqon karo waxa uu rabo
And that is not correct.	Iyo in aanay sax ahayn.
That is not always true.	Taasi mar walba run maaha.
More time.	Waqti badan.
It is what you do.	Waa waxa aad samayso.
Probably right	Malaha waa sax
He wanted me.	Wuu iga rabay.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
I would be fine	Waan ku fiicnaan lahaa
Which is not a bad thing.	Taas oo aan wax xun ahayn.
I didn't want to see anyone now	Ma aanan rabin inaan qof arko hadda
I did not know that anyone was here	Maan ogayn in qof halkan ku jiro
Same for work.	La mid ah shaqada.
I can't help it, really	Ma caawin karo, runtii
He is still a good man.	Wali waa nin fiican.
I have been with him for a long time	Muddo dheer ayaan la joogay
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
I am real now.	Hadda dhab baan ahay.
But no one else did.	Laakiin qof kale ma samayn.
I want to stay, if you will let me	Waxaan rabaa inaan joogo, haddii aad ii ogolaan doonto
I will love it.	Waan jeclaan doonaa.
They will come.	Way iman doonaan.
To his surprise, there was only one.	Si uu ula yaabay, waxaa jiray hal kaliya.
But this is very difficult to do well.	Laakiin tani aad bay u adag tahay in si fiican loo sameeyo.
I think she likes this	Waxaan filayaa inay tan jeceshahay
Still very beautiful.	Weli aad u qurux badan.
I am ready and I am ready	diyaar ayaan ahay oo diyaar ayaan ahay
I knew what needed to be done	Waan ogaa waxa loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo
Well done.	Si fiican.
I could not believe it.	Waan rumaysan waayay.
I just didn’t like it.	Kaliya maan jeclayn.
I will do everything for you	Runtii wax walba waan kuu qaban doonaa
There was something wrong with it	Wax baa ka jiray
Not sure what will happen.	Ma hubo waxa dhici doona.
I did not think so	Maan malayn tan
You will do this, he said.	Waxaad samayn doontaa tan, ayuu yidhi.
I lost	waan waayay
A little strange.	Wax yar oo yaab leh.
I was always right, right	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa mid sax ah, sax ah
I can't see anything here	Wax dib uma arki karo halkan
I hardly knew you existed	Si dhib ah ayaan u ogaa in aad jirto
A very interesting opportunity	Fursad aad u xiiso badan
Suffice it to say.	Waxaa ku filan in la yidhi.
I wonder if she is here or not	Waxaan la yaabay inay halkan joogto iyo in kale
I want to be more for you	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan kuu noqdo
I was just not ready	Kaliya diyaar uma ahayn
Both are great.	Labaduba waa weyn yihiin.
It would be nice so.	Way fiicnaan doontaa sidaas.
Seen next.	Arkay soo socda.
I wanted to see if you could do it.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko inaad samayn karto iyo in kale.
He looks popular.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid la jecel yahay.
It still has to be done.	Weli waa in la sameeyo.
I want to know.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado.
I know everything	Wax walba waan ogahay
Maybe it's too bad, it could be better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u xun tahay, way fiicnaan kartaa.
She could not leave.	Way bixi wayday.
It probably was a bad thing.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd wax xun.
Now there are three.	Hadda waxaa jira saddex.
But they will.	Laakiin way samayn doonaan.
I couldn’t believe she was doing something similar	Ma rumaysan karin inay samaynayso wax la mid ah
I wanted to see him	Waxaan rabay inaan arko isaga
I was really surprised	Run ahaantii waan la yaabay
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
He said to himself, "Hard."	Mid adag ayuu is yidhi.
He came to me.	Wuu ii soo galay.
I want to do it here	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ku sameeyo
I was not able to help anyone.	Ma aanan awoodin inaan cidna caawiyo.
Most of the time, not much.	Inta badan inta kale, maaha wax badan.
I really think this will help	Runtii waxaan filayaa in tani ay caawin doonto
We will see.	Waan arki doonaa.
I really was.	Runtii waan ahaa.
He was once a man.	Mar nin buu ahaa.
No one wants that.	Qofna taas ma rabo.
I have never had it before	Weligay taas ka hor ma helin
And take this.	Oo tan qaado.
But there is no money here.	Laakiin halkan lacag kuma jirto.
We will stay.	Waanu joogi doonaa.
I love when there is so much to do	Waxaan jeclahay marka ay jiraan wax badan oo la sameeyo
I do this with everyone	Waxaan taas la sameeyaa qof walba
That one.	Iyo kan.
I really did not have to say	Runtii ma ahayn in aan sheego
I would like to go	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan tago
This is new to me.	Tani waa igu cusub tahay.
I really like being here	Runtii waan jeclahay inaan halkaan joogo
I had a lot.	Waxaan lahaa wax badan.
Now there was much more to do.	Hadda waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo badan oo la samayn lahaa.
I should have done better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si ka wanaagsan sameeyo.
But he did not say.	Laakiin ma uu odhan.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
I didn't have to do anything	Ma ahayn inaan wax sameeyo
You did nothing.	Waxba ma aadan samayn.
He is with us now.	Hadda wuu nala joogaa.
I can barely see.	Si dhib ah ayaan wax u arki karaa.
I will not even lie to you	Xitaa been kuu sheegi maayo
I knew he knew a lot about it.	Waan ogaa inuu wax badan ka ogaa.
He didn't take much.	Wax badan ma uu qaadan jirin.
you said nothing.	waxba ma aad odhan.
I heard it works well	Waxaan maqlay inuu si fiican u shaqeeyo
That may be correct.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sax.
This is an opportunity to do a lot of good.	Tani waa fursad aad ku samayn karto wax badan oo wanaagsan.
Everything that follows.	Wax kasta oo soo socda.
I may not say it correctly	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan si sax ah u odhan
But he knew that could not be.	Laakiin wuu ogaa in taasi aysan noqon karin.
I did not know what she wanted to say to anyone.	Ma garanayn waxay rabto inay qof u sheegto.
Not bad.	Wax xun maaha.
Tell us how we can help you.	Noo sheeg sida aan kuu caawin karno.
But not exactly.	Laakiin si sax ah maaha.
I will tell you why later	Sababta dib ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa
I had to stay home	Waxay ahayd inaan guriga joogo
But I will need more.	Laakiin waxaan u baahan doonaa wax badan.
Now I have a new job	Hadda waxaan helay shaqo cusub
I can give you one	Mid baan ku siin karaa
But whatever it was she didn't pay.	Laakiin wax kasta oo ay ahayd ma aysan bixin.
A close friend, but only a friend	Saaxiib dhow, laakiin kaliya saaxiib
He saw me.	Wuu i arkay.
It was great to see.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u fiican in la arko.
He did not have much time.	Ma uusan haysan waqti badan.
I think you would really like it	Waxaan filayaa inaad runtii jeclaan lahayd
I would give you a bit.	waxaan ku siin lahaa xoogaa .
He was here, but not now.	Wuu joogay halkan, laakiin hadda ma uu ahayn.
I wanted to talk to you a little bit	Waxaan rabay inaan wax yar kula hadlo
I don't know how much better you are there.	Ma garanayo sida aad halkaas uga wanaagsan tahay.
Someone came in.	Qof baa soo galay.
I thought this would be a good time	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay waqti fiican u ahaan doonto
I had no idea this was going to happen	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn in tani ay dhici doonto
I am a lot	Waxaan ahay wax badan
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
I owe it to you and the rest.	Taas ayaan kugu leeyahay adiga iyo inta kale.
This is not for you.	Tani ma aha adiga.
I had no idea where I was going	Meel aan aado maan fikrad ka haysan
You can see it now, really.	Waad arki kartaa hadda, dhab ahaantii.
That was a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
Tomorrow if you like.	Berri haddii aad jeceshahay.
I left	waan tagay
I just have to say something.	Kaliya inaan wax sheego.
It really is something new.	Runtii waa wax cusub.
I know you may not believe it now	Waan ogahay in laga yaabo inaadan hadda rumaysan
If you don't want to, don't do it.	Haddii aadan rabin, ha sameyn.
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
It will take a very long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
But from time to time.	Laakiin waqti ka waqti.
I was not smart.	Caqli maan ahayn.
I thought they would	Waxaan u maleeyay inay sameyn doonaan
I could not find enough	Waxa aan heli waayay wax igu filan
I did not want to know	Maan rabin inaan ogaado
Now anyone can come back.	Hadda qof kasta wuu soo noqon karaa.
Now it's just me.	Hadda waa aniga oo kaliya.
Everyone can tell everyone good things.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u sheegi karaa qof kasta waxyaabo fiican.
Tell them you like it every day.	U sheeg inaad jeceshahay maalin kasta.
It was not like he had another place to go.	Ma ahayn sida inuu haysto meel kale oo uu aado.
I really hope you do	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso
That is old.	Taasi waa hore.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
Not after what happened.	Ma aha ka dib waxa dhacay.
I need to tell him.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan u sheego.
He would believe.	Wuu rumaysan lahaa.
I did not go	ma tagin
One by one.	Mid mid.
I can get money	Lacag ayaan heli karaa
They are so amazing.	Aad bay u yaab badan yihiin.
I will talk about something real.	Waxaan ka hadli doonaa wax dhab ah.
He needs something new.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay wax cusub.
He wanted to go home.	Wuxuu rabay inuu guriga aado.
This can be great.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn.
Bad idea.	Fikrad xun.
Probably not.	Malaha ma yeeli doonaan.
They probably don't even know how.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan xitaa garanayn sida.
But it is enough.	Laakiin waa ku filan tahay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I will stay here.	Waan joogi doonaa halkan.
I can do it later	Waan samayn karaa ka dib
I do not like one better than you	Ma jecli mid adiga kaa fiican
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo taas.
I really think this will help	Runtii waxaan filayaa in tani ay caawin doonto
I didn't give him anything to hold on to.	Ma siin wax uu ku hayo.
And very big.	Oo aad u weyn.
I had to lie a little	Waxay ahayd inaan been yar sheego
I don't know anything better.	Ma garanayo wax ka fiican.
It's hard to see.	Way adag tahay in la arko.
I am now.	Hadda ayaan ahay.
I had many friends	Waxaan lahaa saaxiibo badan
This, more later.	Tan, in ka badan ka dib.
I wanted this not to be true	Waxa aan rabay in aanay tani run noqon
I know how this will end.	Waan ogahay sida tani ku dhammaan doonto.
I did not do that.	Taas maan samayn.
He knows what he is doing.	Waxa uu sameeyo wuu garanayaa.
Today, there are few.	Maanta, wax yar ayaa jira.
I did not do that	Taas maan samayn
You know he will do it.	Waad ogtahay inuu sameyn doono.
Friend, not close, but still a friend	Saaxiib, maaha mid dhow, laakiin weli waa saaxiib
I was everywhere.	Meel walba waan joogay.
But another and.	Laakiin mid kale iyo.
She didn't want to know.	Ma ay rabin in ay wax ogaato.
He had no idea he was coming here	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inuu halkan yimaado
I wanted to do it personally.	Waxaan rabay inaan qof ahaan u sameeyo.
All I know is	Waxa kaliya ee aan ogahay
He’s here, here.	Wuu joogaa, halkan.
I really did not know	Runtii maan garanayn
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan.
Not that he was a man, really.	Ma aha in uu ahaa nin, dhab ahaan.
I know, it's still a little early.	Waan ogahay, wali waa wax yar hore.
I have one man who is a close friend	Waxaan leeyahay hal nin oo saaxiib dhow ah
But here.	Laakiin halkan.
I didn't like that.	Waan jeclayn taas.
He is not at home yet.	Weli guriga ma joogo.
I have been there for more than a few years.	Waxaan joogay wax ka badan dhowr sano.
I could not find anything better to do	Wax iga fiican oo aan sameeyo maan helin
That if.	Taas haddii.
He came to this.	Waxa uu u yimid kan.
I think that is correct	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi sax tahay
I know this very well	Aad ayaan ugu ogahay taas
I hope someone can help me with this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof iga caawin karo arrintan.
I really knew that	Runtii taas waan ogaa
I love him	Waan jeclahay isaga
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
I just want a man who loves me	Kaliya waxaan rabaa nin i jecel
Very, very much.	Aad iyo aad u dhan.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay sida.
You can pay a lot.	Wax badan ayaad bixin kartaa.
We are one of them.	Waxaan ka mid nahay.
We would be arrested.	Waa nala qaban lahaa.
I didn't like it at first	Maan jeclayn markii hore
Just what.	Kaliya waxa.
I could not do anything else	Wax kale maan qaban karin
I knew that very well	Taas si fiican ayaan u ogaa
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
But now it is even more so.	Laakiin hadda way ka sii badan tahay.
I just want to be here	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkaan joogo
That can't be helped.	Taas lama caawin karo.
I really want to go home	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga
I knew he would never hurt me	Waan ogaa inuusan waligiis i yeeli doonin
Too much.	Aad u badan.
I want you to promise me that will not happen	Waxaan kaa rabaa inaad ii ballan qaado inay taasi dhici doonin
He was a happy friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib oo faraxsan.
Someone said something.	Qof baa wax yidhi.
I really don't want it anymore	Runtii mar dambe ma rabo
Everyone is small.	Qof walba waa yar yahay.
I need to know now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado hadda
I did not know what had happened to me	Ma garanayn waxa igu soo dhacay
I didn't have to.	Ma ay ahayn inaan.
He thought that was smart.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in taasi ay tahay mid caqli badan.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
Everyone looked at me.	Qof kastaa wuu i eegay.
He tried to do the same.	Isla sidaas ayuu isku dayay inuu sameeyo.
It is difficult for everyone.	Way ku adag tahay qof walba.
I want to see a little bit of it	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax yar ka arko
I am still not allowed to speak	Weli waa la ii diiday inaan hadlo
I do the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan sameeyaa.
I took it seriously	Waxaan u qaaday si adag
It really is him.	Dhab ahaantii waa isaga.
I have everything today.	Wax walba maanta waan hayaa.
I heard what you said.	Waxaan maqlay waxaad tidhi.
I really like being with you	Runtii waan jeclahay inaan kula joogo
I think it was something else	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd wax kale
He refused everything.	Wax walba wuu diiday.
You have to be smart.	Waa inaad caqli leedahay.
And so he says.	Oo sidaas ayuu leeyahay.
I should not have gone that way	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas ku baxo
But this is really something new.	Laakiin runtii tani waa wax cusub.
Only once.	Kaliya hal mar.
He did not speak much.	In badan ma uusan hadlin.
I like	waan jeclahay
I'm sure it will be.	Waan hubaa inay ahaan doonto.
Someone needs to see it.	Qof ayaa u baahan inuu arko.
I saw him and he is very much alive	Waan arkay oo aad buu u nool yahay
I did a quick job	Waxaan sameeyay shaqo degdeg ah
But she realized, for sure, that there was nothing else.	Laakiin way ogaatay, hubaal, in aanay wax kale jirin.
I think it looks great.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay u egtahay mid weyn.
I know that is what she wants me to do	Waan ogahay in taasi ay tahay waxa ay rabto in aan sameeyo
I can't believe it would hurt	Ma rumaysan karo inuu wax yeeli lahaa
It was not well.	Si fiican ma uusan ahayn.
He took it well.	Si fiican ayuu u qaatay.
I will always find you	Had iyo jeer waan ku heli doonaa
Not a good idea.	Maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
I hope you can help me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad i caawin karto.
Tell them it had to be done.	U sheeg inay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I always knew you loved me	Mar walba waan ogaa inaad i jeceshahay
I do not know what to do about it	Ma garanayo waxa aan ka sameeyo
I would do that	sidaas ayaan u samayn lahaa
Sure.	Hubaal.
I will never do it.	Weligay ma yeeli doono.
He was never there.	Waligiis ma uu joogin.
I have to go there first and find out	Waa in aan marka hore aado halkaas oo aan ogaado
To learn from.	In wax laga barto.
I think we are	Waxaan u malaynayaa in aan iska nahay
It's bad, it's very, very bad.	Way xun tahay, aad iyo aad bay u xun tahay.
But that may take some time.	Laakiin taasi waxay qaadan kartaa xoogaa samayn.
I will not lie	Been sheegi maayo
I can not go.	Ma tagi karo.
It was indeed an exciting time.	Runtii waxay ahayd wakhti xiiso badan.
I often wonder what he has now	Waxaan inta badan la yaabanahay waxa uu hadda hayo
I knew it all	Waan ogaa taas oo dhan
Not just.	Aan kaliya .
He had someone else.	Qof kale ayuu lahaa.
I got a little bit and I want more	Wax yar ayaan helay oo wax badan ayaan rabaa
I can't say what I do	Ma sheegi karo waxa aan sameeyo
But, it really is not true.	Laakiin, runtii ma run baa.
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
I don't think that's true.	U malayn maayo in taasi run tahay.
It can happen.	Way dhici kartaa.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh .
What a beautiful place.	Maxaa meel qurux badan.
I told him that was not true	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay taasi run ahayn
He is really sorry.	Runtii wuu ka xun yahay.
You are happy.	Waad faraxsan tahay.
It is still you.	Wali waa adiga.
Really good.	Runtii aad u fiican.
No problem now.	Dhib hadda ma jiraan.
That is until tonight.	Taasi waa ilaa caawa.
I still couldn't see anything	Weli waxba maan arki karin
The one who left.	Kii ka baxay.
I'm glad she helped.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay caawiso.
He did not stay long.	Ma uusan joogin waqti dheer.
At first I had no idea.	Markii hore wax fikrad ah kama helin.
I did not do it right	Si sax ah uma aanan samayn
He really didn’t come out.	Dhab ahaantii ma uusan soo bixin.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
I never went that way	Weligay sidaas uma aan bixin
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I can take it from here	Waxaan ka qaadan karaa halkan
It should.	Waa in.
I can do it with difficulty	Si dhib ah ayaan u samayn karaa
I can leave	Waan ka bixi karaa
It really shouldn’t be with anyone right now	Runtii waa inaan cidna la joogin hadda
I can't believe he got this	Ma rumaysan karo inuu tan helay
Work.	Shaqo.
I wondered who he was	Waxa aan la yaabay cidda uu yahay
An appointment is made.	Ballan waa la sameeyaa.
That is beautiful.	Taasi waa qurux.
I am afraid of everything	Wax walba waan ka baqayaa
Someone will come to me.	Qof baa ii iman doona.
I'm glad to see him now.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu hadda arko.
I will be there for a while	Wax yar ayaan halkaas joogi doonaa
It is not.	Ma aha.
That may not be the case.	Taasi ma noqon karto sidaas.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
No one knew he was coming.	Qofna ma garanayn inuu u yimaado.
I have everything.	Wax walba waan hayaa.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
I just want you to know something	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaad wax ogaato
The only way to do it was to hurry.	Sida kaliya ee lagu samayn karaa waxay ahayd si degdeg ah.
I think that is enough now	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ku filan tahay hadda
They may be good at whatever you want to do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku fiican yihiin wax kasta oo aad rabto inaad sameyso.
I'm a little scared	Waxaan ka baqayaa waxa yar
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
Not why, just like.	Ma aha sababta, kaliya sida.
I still have to	Waa inaan weli haysto
She is happy with that.	Way ku faraxsan tahay taas.
Now it is.	Hadda waa.
I can see you know what you need	Waxaan arki karaa inaad ogtahay waxaad u baahan tahay
I would like	waan jeclaan lahaa
I could not leave immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan meesha uga bixi waayay
I would do well to come back.	Waxaan fiicnaan lahayd inaan soo noqdo.
I have to hold on until she needs it again	Waa inaan hayaa ilaa ay mar kale u baahan tahay
It certainly can be.	Waa hubaal inay noqon karto.
you can not come to me.	igama iman kartid.
It was not like now.	Ma ahayn sida hadda.
I felt clear.	Waxaan dareemay si cad.
I would like to.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay.
I could not see anything.	Waxba maan arki karin.
I want to see you there	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko halkaas
I think that's amazing	Waxay ila tahay taasi waa yaab
Again, and again, and again.	Mar kale, iyo mar kale, iyo mar kale.
I'm gone now	hadda waan tagay
I still do not understand	Wali maan fahmin
I think that is true.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi run tahay.
I really enjoyed that	Runtii taas waan ka heli jiray
He said that is one of them.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay taasi ka mid tahay.
I had to find and help	Waxay ahayd inaan helo oo aan caawiyo
I can hardly get her to eat	Si dhib ah ayaan u heli karaa inay cunto
If you like it very much.	Haddii aad jeceshahay si weyn.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
I can take it from here.	Waxaan ka qaadan karaa halkan.
I would take one every day.	Waxaan qaadan lahaa mid maalin kasta.
Now I see that you did	Hadda waxaan arkay inaad sidaas samaysay
I want to talk to him	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo
Something bad was going to happen.	Wax xun ayaa dhici lahaa.
It's amazing.	Waa mid la yaab leh.
I can give you anything and everything you want	Waxaan ku siin karaa wax kasta iyo wax kasta oo aad rabto
I wanted to see it all	Waxaan rabay inaan arko dhammaan
They love that.	Way jecel yihiin taas.
A little older than you	In yar oo kaa weyn
I just want to help people	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo dadka
I want more than anything.	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan wax kasta.
I hope you will not too	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale yeeli doonin
I am very happy to see you	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
I know very little about this	Wax yar ayaan ka ogahay arrintan
He felt like he was someone else.	Wuxuu dareemay inuu yahay qof kale.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
I would like to tell a few people	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aan dhowr qof u sheego
A true friend, he felt.	Saaxiib run ah, wuu dareemay.
Maybe you can do that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad taas samayn karto.
I think I will stay here	Waxaan filayaa inaan halkaan sii joogi doono
I don't know what to do with this.	Ma garanayo waxaan tan ka sameeyo.
It looks a little off.	Waxay u egtahay wax yar.
Given.	La siiyay.
But he was not.	Laakiin ma uusan ahayn.
I was not a good person	Maan ahayn qof wanaagsan
It was not beautiful.	Ma ahayn qurux.
I am also very excited to do it.	Sidoo kale aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay in la sameeyo.
I could be someone else	Waxaan noqon karaa qof kale
I promised not to tell anyone	Waxaan u ballan qaaday in aanan cidna u sheegin
I'm really scared	Runtii aad ayaan uga baqayaa
I just want you tonight	Kaliya caawa ayaan ku rabaa
I would not be	Maan ahaan lahayn
But he had to find out.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inuu ogaado.
Must have someone.	Waa in qof leeyahay.
It is not.	Ma aha .
That really doesn't matter.	Taasi runtii waxba maaha.
Something similar to me.	Wax la mid ah aniga.
I have already seen a place made	Waxaan hore u arkay meel lagu sameeyay
Which we do not.	Taas oo aanu samayn.
You can't see me now.	Hadda ima arki kartid.
And now they are better.	Oo hadda way ka sii fiican yihiin.
I left there a short time ago.	Wax yar ka hor ayaan halkaas ka tagay.
I know it will come	Waan ogahay inay iman doonto
It would be everything.	Waxay noqon lahayd wax kasta.
He began to wonder why.	Waxa uu bilaabay in uu la yaabay sababta.
I have no idea what is in it here	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxa halkan ku jira
It was for everyone.	Waxay ahayd qof walba.
She would love to see you.	Aad bay u jeceshahay inaan ku arko.
Much like she said, he thought.	Inta badan sida ay u tidhi, wuu mooday.
Only good stuff.	Kaliya waxyaabo fiican.
You can go back there	Halkaas ayaad dib ugu noqon kartaa
I hope they will help us	Waxaan filayaa inay nagu caawin doonaan
Three of us, three of us.	Saddex naga mid ah, saddex ka mid ah.
He had to do it	Waxa uu ahaa in uu sameeyo
Will you see ?.	Ma arki doontaa?.
But he that entereth in by the door is shut.	Laakiin kii albaabka ka soo galay ma sii jiro.
I know this is	Waan ogahay in tani ay tahay
There is no work today.	Maanta shaqo ma jirto.
I know you did this for me	Waan ogahay inaad tan ii samaysay
He should not think so.	Waa inuusan sidaas u malayn.
I know that is still a lot	Waan ogahay in taasi wali wax badan tahay
I really like to learn from it	Runtii waan jeclahay in aan wax ka barto
I knew it would not be	Waan ogaa inuusan ahaan doonin
We can't do this.	Tani ma samayn karno.
I hope he is still here	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu weli halkan joogo
I have nothing else to do	Wax kale oo la iga rabo ma hayo
He wanted to leave.	Waxa uu rabay in uu baxo.
Very good friend.	Saaxiib aad u wanaagsan.
Now, everyone knew.	Hadda, qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
I want to be a person again.	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale qof noqdo.
I love you	waan ku jeclahay
You know enough, too much.	Waad ogtahay in kugu filan, aad u badan.
I can't come today.	Maanta ma iman karo.
I can give it to you	waan ku siin karaa
There is nothing new, really.	Wax cusub ma jiro, runtii.
Please tell me	Fadlan ii sheeg
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
It did not help.	Ma aysan caawin.
He can do nothing	Isaga waxba ma samayn karo
I will never leave you again	Mar dambe kaa tagi maayo
I wanted to be like him	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo isaga oo kale
There was nothing that could be done.	Ma jirin wax la sameeyo oo la samayn karo.
I was very, very surprised	Aad iyo aad baan ula yaabay
We can't help it	Kuma caawin karno
You can not be a man.	Ma noqon karto nin.
I don't really know.	Ma garanayo runtii.
now it is.	hadda waa.
I will never leave you again	Mar dambe kaa tagi maayo
I need to eat	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax cuno
I hope more than anything	Waxaan u rajeynayaa in ka badan wax kasta
Several came out.	Dhowr ayaa soo baxay.
I would not say we were friends	Ma odhan lahaa waxaan ahayn saaxiibo
I got this to work so far.	Waxaan taas ku helay inaan shaqeeyo ilaa hadda.
I should know, but not now	Waa inaan ogaado, laakiin hadda maaha
I can see you, you know	Waan ku arki karaa, waad ogtahay
I was very impressed with him.	Aad ayaan ula dhacay isaga.
Here I saw him.	Halkan ayaan ku arkay isaga.
That is a smart job.	Taasi waa shaqo caqli badan.
I look very small	Waxaan u muuqdaa mid aad u yar
I need to buy more cars every day	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan iibsado baabuur badan maalin kasta
Here, now.	Halkan, hadda.
But it's a little harder than that.	Laakiin way ka yara adag tahay taas.
I should have told you earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore kuu sheego
I saw.	waan arkay.
I did not want anyone to know	Maan rabin in qofna ogaado
Not the one he told you he was.	Ma aha ka uu kuu sheegay inuu yahay.
Only tonight.	Kaliya caawa.
No one knew she was here.	Qofna ma ogayn inay halkan joogto.
I would love to see it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
I do, just every day	Waxaan sameeyaa, kaliya maalin kasta
Not just once, but regularly.	Ma aha oo kaliya hal mar, laakiin si joogto ah.
It was real.	Dhab bay ahayd.
I can't do that here.	Ma awoodo inaan taas ka sameeyo halkan.
Something was felt about this.	Wax baa laga dareemay arrintan.
That is how it is now.	Taasi waa sida ay hadda tahay.
I know what's going on here	Waan ogahay waxa halkan ka socda
It is not new.	Mid cusub maaha.
I can tell you that now	Taas waan kuu sheegi karaa hadda
The owners are very nice.	Dadka iska leh aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I was very surprised	Aad baan ula yaabay
It is always the same.	Had iyo jeer waa isku mid.
But it is not certain.	Laakiin lama hubo.
That's weird, but that's how they do it.	Taas oo la yaab leh, laakiin waa sida ay u sameeyaan.
I was unable to speak	Ma awoodin inaan hadlo
But no one came.	Laakiin qofna ma iman.
No one knows me, well.	Qofna ima garanayo, si fiican.
I still can't go there	Ilaa hadda ma aadi karo halkaas
I think she would tell me that	Waxaan filayaa inay taas ii sheegi lahayd
I wondered what she would say to me.	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa ay igu odhan doonto.
You should already know this.	Waa inaad hore u ogaatay tan.
It is money.	Waa lacag.
A few cars, but that's it.	Dhowr baabuur, laakiin taasi waa.
I should have told you first	Waxay ahayd inaan marka hore kuu sheego
I need to do it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo
I think this whole thing is great.	Waxaan filayaa in arrintan oo dhan ay tahay mid weyn.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I was too early.	Waxaan ahaa goor hore.
I will take it as it is.	Waxaan u qaadan doonaa sida ay tahay.
Don't do that.	Ha samayn taas.
It's like.	Waa sida.
I was very impressed	Aad ayaan ula dhacay
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
I was very surprised	Aad ayaan ula yaabay
I quickly withdrew	Degdeg baan uga noqday
Something strange to me.	Wax la yaab leh aniga.
I thought it was likely to go away	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay u badan tahay in laga baxo
I guess he wanted to see that	Waxaan filayaa inuu rabay inaan taas arko
Really, really amazing.	Dhab ahaantii, mid runtii yaab leh.
But now that is not possible.	Laakiin hadda taasi ma dhici karto.
I would expect less	Waxaan filan lahaa wax ka yar
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto arrintan.
I have always been invisible to him	Weligay waxaan ahaa mid aan la arki karin isaga
Him, as someone else saw.	Isaga, sida qof kale u arkay.
I can't do it for you	Ma kuu samayn karo
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
It can no longer be that way.	Hadda ka dib ma noqon karo sidaas oo kale.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
You did the right thing.	Waxaad samaysay wax sax ah.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
I wondered how they lived	Waxaan la yaabay sida ay u nool yihiin
I know how much he loves you	Waan ogahay inta uu ku jecel yahay
I would really like that	Aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa taas
I'm really not optimistic about this	Runtii anigu niyad uma qabo arrintan
I don't want to be separated yet.	Aan rabin in la kala tago weli.
Only people.	Kaliya dadka.
It may not matter.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay waxba ahayn.
Not a good day.	Maalin wanaagsan maaha.
I left somewhere	Meel baan uga tagay
But it can take time.	Laakiin waxay qaadan kartaa waqti.
I also love the other one	Sidoo kale waan jeclahay kan kale
I really wanted to	Aad ayaan u rabay
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
I thought he said a lot.	Waxaan u maleeyay in uu sheegay wax badan.
All she said.	Dhammaan waxay tidhi.
Everyone knows that is not true.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay in taasi run ahayn.
That will be fine.	Taasi way fiicnaan doontaa.
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
They will even give you money.	Xitaa waxay ku siin doonaan lacag.
I could not say that to him	Taas uma sheegi karin isaga
He does not usually come home.	Inta badan guriga ma yimaado.
I knew it was you	Waan ogaa inay tahay adiga
But now it is so.	Laakiin hadda waa sidaas.
Too much, too fast.	Aad u badan, aad u degdeg badan.
I would talk a little bit about that	Wax yar ayaan taas ka hadli lahaa
Whatever is done.	Wax kasta oo la sameeyo.
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
I hope you find it very interesting	Waxaan filayaa inaad ka heli doonto mid aad u xiiso badan
I had one.	Waxaan lahaa mid ka mid ah.
I know this is true	Waxaan ogahay inay tani run tahay
It looks like you.	Waxay u egtahay adiga.
I told him the truth	Run baan u sheegay
He promised me he would.	Wuxuu ii ballan qaaday inuu sameyn doono.
Hard place.	Meel adag.
But him, for sure.	Laakiin isaga, hubaal.
I have never done it with other people	Weligay ma aan samayn dadka kale
I hope it is not too much trouble	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaanan ahayn dhib badan
I never said anything	Weligay waxba kama odhan
I hope to know more	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan wax badan ogaado
I did not know what you wanted	Maan garanayn inaad rabto
No one will stop you.	Qofna kuma joojin doono.
Don't be surprised.	Ha noqon wax yaab leh.
He is a very smart man.	Waa nin caqli badan.
I know you will never do that again	Waan ogahay inaadan taas mar dambe samayn doonin
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
I will stay and help you here	Waan joogi doonaa oo ku caawin doonaa halkan
I was ready, I was ready and I was ready to do that	Diyaar baan u ahaa, diyaar baan u ahaa oo diyaar baan u ahaa inaan taas sameeyo
Always eat plenty of food.	Had iyo jeer cunto aad u badan.
She had no idea, but something.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan, laakiin wax.
Now you are ready for me.	Hadda waxaad diyaar u tahay aniga.
We will not let anyone do anything to you	Ma ogolaan doono in qofna wax kugu sameeyo
You will get something for everyone.	Qof walba wax baad u heli doontaa.
It is very, very difficult.	Aad iyo aad bay u adag tahay.
Yesterday again.	Shalay mar kale.
I haven't seen him in a long time	Muddo dheer kuma arag
I just can't believe it	Kaliya ma rumaysan karo
She said you did well.	Waxay tidhi wax fiican baad samaysay.
This is the same.	Tani waa isku mid.
I really hope you like it	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad rabto
I think that's a good thing	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan
It takes time.	Waqti buu u baahan yahay.
I don't know anything before	Hadda ka hor waxba ma garanayo
It will be well liked.	Si wanaagsan ayaa loo jeclaan doonaa.
I had no idea you could do this	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inaad tan samayn karto
Both are, indeed, very small.	Labaduba waa, runtii, aad u yar.
I am the same.	Waxaan ahay isku si.
I don't want anything	waxba ma rabo
Maybe more now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan hadda.
You do not have to do this alone.	Uma baahnid inaad tan keligaa samayso.
There was no time for this.	Ma jirin wakhti tan.
We will leave here	Waanu ka bixi doonaa halkan
That was a lucky day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin nasiib badan.
But it is not just there.	Laakiin ma aha halkaas oo kaliya.
I went in and started	Waan galay oo bilaabay
Bad, obviously bad.	Xun, si cad u xun.
It can happen.	Way dhici kartaa.
I want to do this.	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan sameeyo.
I said the same thing	Si la mid ah ayaan wax badan u sheegay
I would do everything I can with you	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta oo aan kula joogo
I should not have seen him	Ma ahayn inaan arko isaga
Can someone please help me with this.	Qof fadlan ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
I was so surprised by him	Aad baan ula yaabay isaga oo kale
Maybe we are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan nahay.
That would be a little better.	Taasi way yara fiicnaan lahayd.
This is a lie.	Tani waa been.
Maybe it doesn't matter to me!	Malaha waxba igama qabo!
I have not always been successful	Mar walba ma aan guulaysan
It may not be right now, but it would.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan hadda ahayn, laakiin way yeeli lahayd.
I always saw them all.	Mar walba waan wada arki jiray.
Can someone please help?	Qof fadlan ma caawin karaa.
I told you he was a great man	Waxaan kuu sheegay inuu nin weyn yahay
I think that is what made it so much fun	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi tahay waxa ka dhigay mid aad u xiiso badan
That's what he told me.	Waa waxa uu ii sheegay.
It wasn’t the biggest.	Ma ahayn tan ugu weyn.
We will be best friends.	Waxaan noqon doonaa saaxiibo ugu fiican.
They will need you more than ever.	Waxay kuu baahan doonaan in ka badan sidii hore.
I could not see very well	Si fiican wax uma arki karin
I thought it was a terrible thing	Waxaan u arkay inay tahay wax aad u xun
If you are smart, you will go to the exit.	Haddii aad caqli leedahay, waxaad aadi doontaa meesha laga baxo.
I was given another chance	Fursad kale ayaa la i siiyay
That will do.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa.
If anything.	Haddii ay wax wanaagsan tahay.
I wish I could be able to do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan awoodo inaan taas sameeyo.
It was here.	Waxay ahayd halkan.
But there is no urgency.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax degdeg ah.
I wouldn’t do it for everyone	Uma samayn lahaa qof walba
Maybe he should have told someone.	Malaha waxay ahayd inuu qof u sheego.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma samayn doono
Another long time.	Waqti dheer oo kale.
He wanted to.	Waxa uu rabay.
I can't speak.	Ma hadli karo.
Anyone can see why.	Qof kasta wuu arki karaa sababta.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
Still, there must be more fun here.	Weli, waa in ay jiraan xiiso badan halkan.
Maybe both are true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in labaduba run yihiin.
I really wouldn’t say.	Runtii ma odhan doono.
I may have said this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan tan sheegay.
I really wanted to be with you	Waxaan runtii rabay inaan kula joogo
I do not want to know that.	Ma doonayo inaan taas ogaado.
Another big surprise.	Yaab weyn oo kale.
I know you don't like it.	Waan ogahay inaadan jeclayn.
I am a good person.	Waxaan ahay qof wanaagsan.
I doubt something will come out of it	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay wax ka soo bixi doonaan
I still have it.	Wali waan hayaa.
I should have been here earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore halkan joogo
He can help you.	Wuu ku caawin karaa.
Just to know that.	Kaliya in la ogaado taas.
Both were unsuccessful	Labaduba kuma guulaysan
Not so much, anymore.	Ma aha sidaas u badan, mar dambe.
I can't do that, not now	Taas ma samayn karo, hadda maaha
And it will stay here.	Oo halkan way joogi doontaa.
You are very difficult.	Aad baad u adag tahay.
I will not believe that	Ma rumaysan doono taas
I did not know it was the same	Maan garanayn inay la mid tahay
I want you to say nothing.	Waxaan kaa rabaa inaadan waxba sheegin.
It was found	Waa la helay
I can't stay here anymore	Ma sii joogi karo halkan in ka badan
I know that	Waan ogahay taas
I still can't see anything	Wali waxba ma arki karo
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
Everyone loves him.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay isaga.
I want to, yet.	Waxaan rabaa, weli.
That’s how it is here and how it is here.	Taasi waa sida halkan iyo sida halkan.
I'll stop here.	Waxaan ku joojin doonaa halkan.
I will help you here	halkaan ayaan kugu caawin doonaa
I had to stay there a long time	Waxay ahayd in aan halkaas sii joogo waqti dheer
I have to see a friend	Waa inaan arko saaxiib
There is no such thing here.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah halkan.
The harder it is, the better.	Inta adag, ayaa ka sii fiican.
As much as you want.	Inta aad rabto.
But it can do this.	Laakiin way samayn kartaa tan.
He does not need to speak.	Ma aha inuu u baahan yahay inuu hadlo.
Not sure what to do about it	Ma hubo waxa aan ka samaynayo
Very soon.	Waqti aad ugu dhow.
We can not see.	Ma arki karno.
That is a thing.	Taasi waa wax.
I'll take it shortly.	Waxaan ku qaadan doonaa in yar ka dib.
It is their favorite place.	Waa meesha ay jecel yihiin.
She did not like that.	Ma ay jeclayn taas.
He did something that everyone wants to do and not do.	Wuxuu sameeyay wax qof kastaa rabo inuu sameeyo oo uusan samayn.
Now this can be a problem.	Hadda tani waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
I look forward to seeing you there	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkaas
I think everyone has	Waxaan filayaa in qof walba uu leeyahay
I had to talk to someone	Waxay ahayd inaan qof la hadlo
It will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doono.
That was not done.	Taas lama samayn.
It would not be right.	Sax ma ahaan lahayd.
Maybe not once.	Laga yaabaa in aan hal mar.
I took something from you	Wax baan kaa qaatay
It is very good for me.	Aad bay ii fiican tahay.
I just spent a lot of time.	Kaliya waqti badan ayaan qaatay.
That is exactly what it is.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan waxa ay tahay.
Everyone else did.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
It is real.	Waa wax dhab ah.
Now it was an opportunity to say something.	Hadda waxay ahayd fursad wax lagu sheego.
Just tell me that.	Kaliya taas ii sheeg.
This will definitely help.	Tani hubaal way caawin doontaa.
I'm sure he'll be fine now.	Waxaan hubaa inuu hadda fiicnaan doono.
She didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma aysan helin.
No one would say anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan lahaa.
What an interesting person.	Waa maxay qof xiiso leh.
Even if it's bad, even if it's really bad.	Xitaa haddii ay xun tahay, xitaa haddii ay run ahaantii xun tahay.
I'm sorry	Waan ka xumahay
I was not the same	Wax la mid ah maan ahayn
I do not know where to go	Ma garanayo meel aan aado
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
hold me.	ii qabo isaga.
I can only tell you this	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa tan kaliya
Obviously, he would have stayed earlier.	Sida cad, hore ayuu u joogi lahaa.
Not a very good job.	Ma aha shaqo aad u wanaagsan.
No one was present.	Meesha qofna kuma jirin.
He heard today.	Maanta ayuu maqlay.
That is the only thing she can do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay sameyn karto.
I certainly did not leave anyone behind.	Hubaal inaanan cidna uga tagin.
I wanted to stay that way for a long time	Waxaan rabay inaan sidaas sii joogo muddo dheer
I felt lucky.	Waxaan dareemay nasiib.
I really like him	Runtii waan jeclahay isaga
I can tell you more	Wax badan ayaan kuu sheegi karaa
Why do you need it.	Maxaad ugu baahan tahay.
I won't get it right all the time.	Ma heli doono sax mar kasta.
Not surprisingly, but well.	Ma aha la yaab leh, laakiin si fiican.
I hope you are happy with this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ku faraxsan tahay arrintan.
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
I pretended not to see	Waxaan iska dhigay inaanan arag
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
A bit, really.	Xoogaa, dhab ahaantii.
It's all very interesting	Dhammaan waa wax aad u xiiso badan
Give it to him.	I sii isaga.
I was even surprised that the past actually happened	Waxaan xitaa la yaabay in wixii hore run ahaantii dhacay
This was work.	Tani waxay ahayd shaqo.
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
Otherwise, it will happen.	Haddii kale, way dhici doontaa.
But that is a problem.	Laakiin taasi waa dhibaato.
I did not want to leave the house	Ma rabin inaan guriga ka baxo
There were several.	Waxaa jiray dhowr.
But that was a coincidence.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wax iska dhacay.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
I really had one made for me	Runtii waxaan lahaa mid la ii sameeyay
You can find it here.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
I'm pretty sure today.	Waxaan aad u hubaa in maanta.
I just couldn't find him.	Kaliya waan heli waayay isaga.
I knew what it looked like	Waan ogaa sida ay u egtahay
I am the new place	Waxaan ahay meesha cusub
I saw him the day after he got it	Waxaan arkay isaga maalin ka dib markii uu helay
I think you should go home, now	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad aado guriga, hadda
I would do the same	Waxaan samayn lahaa isla wax la mid ah
I think it looks beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inay u egtahay mid qurux badan
I will not always be here	Mar walba halkan ma joogi doono
Everything is very difficult.	Wax walba aad bay u adag yihiin.
Really interesting.	Runtii xiiso leh.
I put it off	Dib baan u dhigay
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
I did not want him to come to you	Maan rabin inuu kuu yimaado
Live, really.	Nool, dhab ahaantii.
I wanted it, and it gave it to me	Waan rabay, oo waa i sii
I think he would believe me	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu i rumaysan lahaa
I know this is a very difficult time for you	Waan ogahay in tani ay kugu tahay wakhti aad u adag
It was a little beautiful.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo qurux badan.
I really enjoyed it here	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay halkan
But well.	Laakiin si wanaagsan.
Pick him up.	Soo qaado isaga.
I think you know what happened	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad ogtahay waxa dhacay
Good luck.	Nasiib wanaagsan.
I felt abandoned and helpless	Waxaan dareemay in la iga tagay oo aan is caawin waayay
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
And all good.	Oo wax walba oo wanaagsan.
I didn't think so.	Uma malaynayn.
I could not see, but he was there	Ma aan arki karin, laakiin wuu joogay
I had to get out of there.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas ka baxo.
It will not do, that is for sure	Ma yeeli doono, taasi waa hubaal
I will pay.	waan bixin doonaa.
Which you can do here.	Taas oo aad ka samayn karto halkan.
At first he said nothing.	Markii hore waxba ma uu odhan.
I can leave and I can go	Waan ka bixi karaa oo waan tagi karaa
What will happen?	Maxaa dhici doona?.
I have to see you again	Waa inaan mar kale arko
I did not know.	Maan garanayn.
I was very impressed with this	Aad baan ula dhacay arrintan
There is no way to tell.	Ma jirto si loo sheego.
That is why I go there.	Taasi waa sababta aan u aado halkaas.
This is not the case.	Tani ma aha sidaas oo kale.
I could not say well.	Maan si fiican u odhan karin.
I just have to see it	Kaliya waa inaan arko
I really left	Runtii waan ka baxay
I want to know about you	Waxaan rabaa in aan adiga kaa ogaado
I did not want to talk	Ma rabin inaan hadlo
He felt a little more now.	Waxa uu dareemay in yar oo kale hadda.
I did not give anything to anyone	Waxba maan siin waxa qof u yaqaan
I think everything that happened is fine	Waxaan filayaa in wax walba oo dhacay ay u wanaagsan yihiin
She has one.	Waxay leedahay mid.
ima ark kartid.	ima arki kartid.
I wanted to talk to someone	Waxaan rabay inaan qof la hadlo
I love being a man.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan noqdo nin.
I have no idea who he is	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo cidda uu yahay
It will take work and time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa shaqo iyo waqti.
This is for everyone.	Tani waa qof walba.
I looked again.	Mar kale ayaan eegay.
But something else is coming.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa soo socda.
You just said.	Kaliya waad tidhi.
But, maybe.	Laakiin, malaha.
Much, much less.	In badan, aad uga yar.
She did not want him to leave the room.	Ma ay rabin inuu qolka ka baxo.
I really did not like it	Runtii maan jeclayn
I think it was different	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay si kale u ahayd
That is a good job if you can get it.	Taasi waa shaqo fiican haddii aad heli karto.
I know you do.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyso.
No one saw anything.	Qofna waxba ma arag.
I asked her what she was doing	Waxaan waydiiyay waxay samaynayso
He asked.	Wuu ka codsaday.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
I said.	aniga ayaa sheegtay.
I know who you are now	Waan ogahay qofka aad tahay hadda
As soon as I get there.	Isla markii aan halkaas tago.
After tonight.	Caawa ka dib.
I knew what you wanted	Waan ogaa waxaad rabto
He likes to be close to home.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu guriga u dhow yahay.
I wanted you to know.	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato.
They should not have done it.	Ma ay ahayn inay sameeyaan.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
I did not have much time	Ma aanan haysan waqti aad u dheer
He said for sure.	Wuxuu yidhi hubaal.
I haven't had that for a while	Taas in muddo ah maan helin
I can tell you that.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegi karaa.
I felt a little weird	Waxaan dareemay xoogaa yaab leh
Unemployment as well.	Shaqo la'aan sidoo kale.
I have nothing.	Waxba ma hayo.
I should not have said anything	Ma ahayn inaan wax sheego
I have never seen anything like it	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah
I think it's nothing.	Waxaan filayaa in aanay waxba ahayn.
I just can't do it for him	Kaliya ma samayn karo isaga
I fell for it, but it was very good	Waan ku dhacay, laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan
I will be.	Waxaan ahaan doonaa.
Maybe someone else has been through this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof kale uu ku dhacay arrintan.
But it is not a big deal.	Laakiin wax weyn maaha.
I don't want him there.	Ma rabo isaga halkaas.
I rejected everything	Wax walba waan diiday
Soon after a long time	Wax yar ka dib muddo dheer
It needs to find something new and great.	Waxay u baahan tahay in la helo wax cusub oo weyn.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
Now it was here.	Hadda halkan waxay ahayd.
Do not let it.	Ha u ogolaan.
I really enjoyed talking to you	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay inaan kula hadlo
I got a good paid job	Waxaan helay shaqo lacag fiican leh
I will be a friend	Waxaan noqon doonaa saaxiib
You can see it there.	Waxaad ka arki kartaa halkaas.
I suspect he was telling the truth	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inuu run sheegay
I wish you could still be here	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad weli halkan joogi karto
Everyone wants to make money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu lacag sameeyo.
I have to keep it	Waa inaan hayaa
I told him that no one was me	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay cidna aniga ahayn
I would like to know.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado.
But that really is not the case.	Laakiin taasi run ahaantii maaha.
He had only one.	Mid kaliya ayuu lahaa.
I could not come back	Dib ayaan u soo noqon waayay
Not that it was.	Ma aha in ay ahayd .
She didn't want to do it.	Ma ay rabin inay samayso.
How good is that?	Sidee u fiican taasi?.
We are still.	Wali waanu nahay.
But this is true.	Laakiin tani waa run.
Probably we are.	Waxay u badan tahay inaan nahay.
I may not be the best at this	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan noqon qofka ugu fiican kan
I have never seen it.	Weligay ma arag.
I hope you will see me again	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad mar kale i arki doonto
I may talk about this again	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar kale ka hadlo arrintan
No one wanted to.	Qofna ma rabin.
I did not think he had said that before.	Uma malaynayn inuu sidaas oo kale hore u yidhi.
I can't do it any other way	Si kale ma yeeli karo
He did well there.	Si fiican ayuu halkaas uga sameeyay.
I can't do much about that.	Wax badan kama qaban karo taas.
I would be too	Waxaan noqon lahaa sidoo kale
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ma awoodo, ma awoodo, ma awoodo.
I'm not sure if anyone really knows.	Ma hubo in qofna runtii garanayo.
I will tell you everything.	Wax walba waan u sheegi doonaa.
I wondered why he did it	Waxaan la yaabay sababta uu u sameeyay
I know it's not you.	Waan ogahay in aanay adiga ahayn.
A good place for us.	Meel noo fiican.
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad wanaagsan.
No one could tell this	Qofna uma sheegi karin arrintan
I love learning from people	Waxaan jeclahay in aan dadka wax ka barto
what would you do	maxaad samayn lahayd
I did not want to stay home	Ma rabin inaan guriga joogo
I also think this is how it is	Waxaan sidoo kale u maleynayaa inay tani tahay sida ay tahay
But no one knows.	Laakiin qofna waxba ma garanayo.
Everything would be fine.	Wax walba way fiicnaan lahayd.
Not sure how much.	Ma hubo inta.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
But the former still exists.	Laakiin kii hore weli wuu jiray.
I really have no idea why.	Runtii wax fikrad ah uma hayo sababta.
I think it is interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay mid xiiso leh.
The person.	Qofka.
I am not.	Aniga ma jiro.
But, this is better.	Laakiin, tani waa ka wanaagsan tahay.
But now there was no chance.	Laakiin hadda ma jirin fursad.
I did not know where to go from here	Maan garanayn meel aan ka tago halkan
She can do that.	Way samayn kartaa taas.
I became incapable of doing anything else	Waxaan noqday qof aan awoodin inaan wax kale sameeyo
I was always there for him	Mar walba isaga ayaan u joogay
I'm sure she did.	Waan hubaa inay samaysay.
I think everything else is fine	Waxaan u maleynayaa in wax walba oo kale ay fiican yihiin
I have already tried everything	Waxaan mar hore isku dayay wax walba
I had a lot of work today	Waxaan lahaa shaqo badan maanta
That she will be there for a long time.	In ay halkaas joogi doonto muddo dheer.
Don't tell me they are not here.	Ha ii sheegin in aanay halkan joogin.
Maybe I was also invisible	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidoo kale ahaa mid aan la arki karin
And here too.	Oo halkan sidoo kale.
It is an unbelievable place.	Waa meel aan la rumaysan karin.
I’ve never been here, bad luck	Weligay halkan ma joogin, tan xun
I think they are real	Waxaan filayaa inay dhab yihiin
I thought he did.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu sameeyay.
It is difficult for me today.	Maanta way igu adag tahay.
I have done this several times.	Waxaan tan sameeyay dhowr jeer oo kale.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I did not want another problem	Ma rabin dhibaato kale
So far there is nothing he does not like.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax uusan jeclayn.
Now.	Hadda.
I was one and the other.	Waxaan ahaa mid iyo mid kale.
I am the only one there.	Aniga kaliya ayaa jira.
Now, we are even.	Hadda, waxaan nahay xitaa.
I hope this will help	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto
He was with us.	Wuu nala joogay.
I told him.	Waxaan u sheegay.
I will tell you.	waan kuu sheegi doonaa.
To do this you need.	Si aad tan u samayso waxaad u baahan tahay.
I did not know who she was	Maan garanayn cidda ay tahay
Surprisingly, they are very small.	Yaab weyn, aad bay u yar yihiin.
It does not have to be very difficult.	Ma aha inuu aad u adag yahay.
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxa aan sameeyo.
I want to lie	Waxaan rabaa inaan been u sheego

I really did not want to	Runtii halkan maan rabin
There was nothing I could do.	Wax aan sameeyo ma jirin.
I will not do that	Anigu sidaas ku yeeli maayo
I know it was for me	Waan ogahay inay aniga ii ahayd
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
It is true now.	Waa run hadda.
It was not just me.	Aniga kaliya ma ahayn.
Let him go alone.	Keligiis ha baxo.
If he sees you, he will stop you.	Haddii uu ku arko, wuu ku joojin doonaa.
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
Too bad they didn’t go.	Aad u xun ma aysan tagin.
If they like it, they like it.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin, way jecel yihiin.
A little faster	In yar oo degdeg ah
It was not.	Ma lahayn.
It was thought to be unnecessary	Waxaa loo maleeyay inaan loo baahnayn
They both do.	Labaduba way sameeyaan.
I knew this was not true	Waan ogaa in tani aysan run ahayn

They still believe.	Weli way rumaysan yihiin.
I was great.	Waxaan ahaa mid weyn.
But he was often unemployed.	Laakiin in badan ayuu shaqo la’aan ahaa.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
And now, your job.	Oo hadda, aad shaqada.
Harder than before.	Ka adag sidii hore.
And one got.	Oo mid helay.
I want to help.	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo.
I have no idea if she likes it or not.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay jeceshahay iyo in kale.
He was right.	Run buu sheegay.
I asked him if he had come here	Waxaan waydiiyay inuu halkan soo galay iyo in kale
I am here, he said.	waan joogaa, ayuu yidhi.
We just can't see him.	Kaliya ma arki karno isaga.
He has a problem.	Dhibaato ayuu qabaa.
Can anyone help me do this please.	Qof ma iga caawin karaa inaan tan sameeyo fadlan.
I had one person to help me.	Waxaan lahaa hal qof oo i caawin lahaa.
I am more than him.	Aniga ayaa ka badan isaga.
I know you think so	Waan ogahay inaad is leedahay
I was nothing	Waxba maan ahayn
I'm sorry, but so be it.	Waan ka xumahay, laakiin waa sidaas.
I am very happy now	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay hadda
A car collided.	Baabuur ayaa isku dhacay.
Maybe he would.	Malaha wuu yeeli lahaa.
I found it very interesting	Waxaan u arkay inay tahay mid aad u xiiso badan
Is that really going to be very difficult ?.	Runtii taasi ma noqon doontaa mid aad u adag?.
I thought it was hard to find	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay adag tahay in la helo
I hope that helps.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi ay caawiso.
Maybe him, too.	Malaha isaga, sidoo kale.
Maybe I'll be home later.	Malaha waxaan ahaan doonaa guriga mar dambe.
There was.	Waxaa jiray.
Certainly not.	Run ahaantii maaha.
It really wasn't.	Runtii ma uu ahayn.
I did not report	Maan soo sheegin
It did not exist now.	Hadda ma jirin.
I know you did this	Waan ogahay inaad tan samaysay
You would really be good at that.	Runtii waad ku fiicnaan lahayd taas.
I'm still surprised.	Weli waan yaabay.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
I should never have left you	Ma ahayn inaan weligay kaa tagin
What was even here.	Maxay ahayd xitaa halkan.

I had no money for food	Wax lacag ah cunto uma haysan
From now on.	Hadda ka dib.
I have an idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad.
He felt the same way.	Waxa uu dareemay sidaas oo kale.
Maybe he does something too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale wax sameeyo.
It is difficult to know exactly why.	Way adag tahay in si sax ah loo ogaado sababta.
I do not understand why it is not	Ma fahmin sababta aysan u ahayn
It will not take long	Waqti dambe kama qaadan doono
More than him.	Wax ka badan isaga.

I love people	Waxaan jeclahay dadka

I don't want to know anymore.	Mar dambe ma doonayo inaan ogaado.
I could not speak, I did not want to speak	Ma hadli karin, ma rabin inaan hadlo

As it was.	Sidii ay ahayd.
I hope it will be better	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiicnaan doonto

Just tell them.	Kaliya u sheeg.
I wanted more than him	Waxa aan rabay in ka badan isaga
But just need a chance.	Laakiin kaliya u baahan fursad.
He needs someone like you.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay qof adiga oo kale ah.
Why we are as we are	Waa maxay sababta aan u nahay sida aan nahay
Give it time.	Waqti sii.
I was lucky	nasiib ayaan lahaa
Now let me tell you.	Hadda aan kuu sheego.
I didn't want to know.	Maan rabin inaan ogaado.
Over time, that will become a problem.	Waqti ka dib, taasi waxay noqon doontaa dhibaato.
And good old, too.	Oo hore fiican, sidoo kale.
I would love to see that.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan taas arko.
That would happen.	Taasi way dhici lahayd.

I always had something to say	Had iyo jeer waxaan lahaa wax aan u sheego
I will not talk to you again	Mar dambe la hadli maayo
He is everywhere and everyone at once.	Meel walba iyo qof walba hal mar ayuu joogaa.
It was felt. 	Waa la dareemay. 
received a year later.	helay hal sano ka dib.
I looked away	Waan iska eegay
Now he clearly knew.	Hadda si cad ayuu u ogaa.
I can't say anything else	Wax kale ma odhan karo
I'm sure she is beautiful.	Waan hubaa inay qurux badan tahay.
Others were not like that.	Dadka kale sidaas uma ay ahayn.
I am what you are all about	Waxaan ahay waxa aad tahay oo dhan
It is just as true.	Waa run oo kale.
He should, but he may not.	Waa inuu, laakiin laga yaabaa inuusan.
I gave you everything.	Wax walba waan ku siiyay.

I need to see what she really wants	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko waxay runtii rabto
I wonder where he really lives	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka uu ku nool yahay runtii
I think that was right	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax ahayd
I came out.	Waan soo baxay.
There may be even some truth.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto xitaa xoogaa run ah.
I'm really someone else	Runtii waxaan ahay qof kale
It is difficult to see why.	Way adag tahay in la arko sababta.
I will not let you do it	Ma ogolaan doono inaad sameyso
This is more than true now.	Tani waa wax ka badan run hadda.
No one else has seen it.	Qof kale ma arag.
I'm scared, he thought.	Waxaan ka baqayaa, ayuu u maleeyay.
I need a new one	Waxaan u baahanahay mid cusub
That's how it felt.	Sidaas ayaa dareemay.
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
He should not be here.	Waa inuusan halkaan joogin.
He did not do that.	Taas ma uu samayn.
You told me enough was enough.	Waxaad ii sheegtay in badan oo kugu filan.
That was not true.	Taasi run ma ahayn.
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
No one spoke	Cidna lama hadlin
It couldn’t have been more fun on its own.	Ma ay noqon karin mid aad u xiiso badan keligiis.
I thought it would be once, but	Waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon doonto hal mar, laakiin
I had to do what was best for him	Waxay ahayd inaan u sameeyo waxa isaga u wanaagsan
And more and more continues.	Iyo in ka badan iyo in ka badan ayaa sii socda.
I have not yet gone home	Wali ma tagin guriga
It will not do that.	Taas ma yeeli doono.
Really, I'm really sorry.	Runtii, aad ayaan uga xumahay.
But please tell us why.	Laakiin fadlan noo sheeg sababta.
But today, here it is.	Laakiin maanta, waa kan.
One year.	Hal sano.
I love this.	Waan jeclahay kan.
This is really amazing.	Runtii tani waa yaab.
Certainly not, but probably not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha, laakiin malaha.
Both will happen.	Labaduba way dhici doonaan.
He is very big.	Aad ayuu u weyn yahay.
I took it back and looked at him	Waxaan dib u qaaday oo eegay isaga
I still can't believe it	Wali ma rumaysan karo
You can make a time when you will be ready.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wakhti aad diyaar noqon doonto.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
I have someone ready for you	Waxaan ku leeyahay qof diyaar u ah
Do not miss an opportunity.	Ha ka tagin fursad.
But he can do it.	Laakiin wuu samayn karaa.
I know all you have done	Waan ogahay waxaad samaysay oo dhan
I went to great lengths to find it.	Dhibaato badan ayaan u galay si aan u helo.
It really is as it is.	Dhab ahaan waa sida ay tahay.
I have to be with him	Waa inaan la joogaa isaga
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
That can only come from.	Taasi waxay ka iman kartaa oo kaliya.
They are really better.	Runtii way ka fiican yihiin.
He was a very good friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib aad u wanaagsan.
Otherwise I would not be here	Haddii kale halkan ma joogi lahaa
Not only that.	Ma aha oo kaliya.
I just want to know who you are	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado qofka aad tahay
I need only one.	Waxaan u baahanahay hal kaliya.
I'm a little out of it, that's all.	Waan ka yara baxay, waa dhan.
I didn't even want to see you	Xitaa ma rabin inaan ku arko
I know it will happen	Waan ogahay inay dhici doonto
Tell them what's going on here.	U sheeg waxa halkan ka socda.
I can't find it now	Hadda ma heli karo
I was with him for three years	Saddex sano ayaan la joogay
There was no one right.	Qof sax ah ma jirin.
This is the same.	Tani waa isku mid.
I told her it was right	Waxaan u sheegay in ay sax tahay
I want to see you again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale arko
I think it will get better	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono
I did not do it all	Maan wada qaban
He would do well	Si fiican ayuu u qaban lahaa
I thought it was very good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u wanaagsan tahay
He's gone, he's gone.	Wuu baxay, wuu baxay.
It's a great idea.	Waa fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
I love you now and always	hadda iyo mar walba waan ku jeclahay
I even went out with a man several times	Xitaa dhowr jeer ayaan nin la baxay
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
That doesn't look like much.	Taasi uma eka wax badan.
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
I just fell for it	Kaliya si degdeg ah ayaan u dhacay
He really wants to.	Aad ayuu u rabaa.
They are still friends	Wali waa saaxiibo
I couldn't see very well.	Aad baan u arki waayay.
More than that, she realized she was right.	Si ka sii badan, waxay ogaatay inay sax tahay.
That’s how we can be better.	Taasi waa sida aan u fiicnaan karno.
We will get out of this.	Waanu ka bixi doonaa kan.
No one knew who we were.	Qofna ma garanayn cidda aanu nahay.
This was not a new idea.	Tani ma ahayn fikrad cusub.
Let me talk to you.	Aan la hadlo.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma samayn doono
I was not able to do that	Ma awoodin inaan taas sameeyo
All right now and right.	Dhammaan hadda iyo sax.
He had to say something.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax sheego.
I'll leave for a bit today	Waxaan bixi doonaa xoogaa maanta
I just need to stay a little longer	Waxaan kaliya u baahanahay inaan sii joogo wax yar ka dheer
I thought it was something	Waxaan u maleeyay inay wax tahay
I should not have told you that	Ma ahayn inaan sidaas kuu sheego
There is nothing good.	Wax wanaagsan ma jiraan.
It looks like you have to do the same.	Waxay u egtahay inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso.
Not the only reason, but it is actually the main reason.	Ma aha sababta kaliya, laakiin dhab ahaantii waa sababta ugu weyn.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma aha.
I know you will love it	Waan ogahay inaad jeclaan doonto
This I have set for a very long time	Tan waxaan dhigay waqti aad u dheer
I put it there, so they will stay there	Waxaan dhigay halkaas, si ay halkaas u sii joogi doonaa
This can take a long time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer.
I wonder why he did that	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu sidaas u sameeyay
I thought you could not come from here.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaadan halkan ka iman karin.
All of him.	Isaga oo dhan.
I do not know if that is true.	Ma garanayo inay taasi run tahay.
Someone has to.	Qof waa inuu.
I told him that.	Taas ayaan u sheegay.
I could not see	Maan arki karin
I'm afraid to tell you	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan kuu sheego
I do not.	Ma sameeyo.
I just don't see it.	Kaliya ma arko.
I am nothing like you	Anigu waxba ma ihi adiga oo kale
Whatever was, it became nothing.	Wixii wax walba ahaan jiray, ayaa noqday waxba.
And she didn't.	Oo ma ay lahayn.
I think it is very interesting	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u xiiso badan tahay
Something else as well.	Wax kale sidoo kale.
But that’s just me.	Laakiin taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
I just bought it	Hadda waan iibsaday
After today.	Maanta ka dib.
But not here.	Laakiin halkan maaha.
I have no idea what this might be.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxa ay tani noqon karto.
I do not want to miss any opportunity.	Ma doonayo inaan wax fursad ah uga tago.
I told you something someone.	Wax baan kuu sheegay qof.
They did not say.	Ma ay odhan.
I could not believe he was doing this to me	Ma aan rumaysan karin inuu tan igu samaynayo
This was something new, he thought.	Tani waxay ahayd wax cusub, ayuu u maleeyay.
Which is also true.	Taas oo la mid ah sidoo kale.
I know how bad it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay u xun tahay.
I did something amazing new.	Waxaan sameeyay wax cusub oo yaab leh.
I felt, everywhere.	Waxaan dareemay, meel kasta.
They need me.	Way ii baahan yihiin.
I could not go far	Meel dheer ma aadi karin
If there is a small space.	Haddii ay jirto meel yar.
I looked to see if he was serious.	Waxaan eegay inuu dhab ka yahay iyo in kale.
I will not do it again	Mar dambe ma samayn doono
Very bad for him.	Aad ugu xun isaga.
He loves me.	Wuu i jecel yahay.
No one else can do that	Mid kale ma sameyn karo sidaas
I know how this will end	Waan ogahay sida tani ku dhammaan doonto
I saw something.	Wax baan arkay.
This is very difficult.	Tani aad bay u adag tahay.
I did not want to see	Maan rabin inaan arko
I have no idea if she likes it or not	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay jeceshahay iyo in kale
Like me, really.	Aniga oo kale, dhab ahaantii.
I will be close.	Waxaan noqon doonaa meel dhow.
This she did.	Tani waxay samaysay.
I do not know	Ma garanayo
I need you to tell me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad ii sheegto
Also, this is interesting.	Sidoo kale, tani waa mid xiiso leh.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
Tell them everything you like.	U sheeg wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
It really is a great place.	Runtii waa meel aad u wanaagsan.
Say it again.	Mar kale sheeg.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
Lots of work.	Shaqo badan.
I really did.	Runtii taas ayaan sameeyay.
Ima yeeli kartid	Ima yeeli kartid
Nothing is learned.	Waxba lama barto.
I did not understand	Ma aanan fahmin
I have to do something good for him	Waa inaan u sameeyaa wax fiican isaga
Tell me something.	Wax ii sheeg.
I'm so sorry	Aad baan ugu xumahay
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
He would love to stay.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu joogo.
I just started early	Waxaan hadda bilaabay waqti hore
That is not for you.	Taasi adiga oo kale maaha.
He picked one up.	Mid buu soo qaaday.
I can't believe he really owns me	Ma rumaysan karo inuu dhab ahaantii aniga leeyahay
I know you don't	Waan ogahay inaadan samayn
She said you did.	Waxay tidhi waad samaysay.
I found it here	halkaan ayaan ku helay
I had no idea	Wax fikrad ah kama aan haysan
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Lama garanayo waxa ay tahay.
I hope he stays longer	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu waqti dheer sii joogi doono
I should have gone earlier	Waxay ahayd inaan mar hore tago
We will do whatever you want	Waxaan samayn doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto

I have to be with you	Waa inaan kula joogaa
He knew he was lucky.	Wuxuu ogaa inuu nasiib leeyahay.
You think you like me.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad i jeceshahay.
She lied to me a lot.	Been badan bay ii sheegtay.
I would love to see you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko.
I think it's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiican tahay.
They are very fresh and beautiful.	Aad bay u cusub yihiin oo qurux badan yihiin.

Nothing real.	Wax dhab ah maaha.
I can tell he is very happy	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inuu aad ugu faraxsan yahay
You know.	Waad ogtahay.
Also very good.	Sidoo kale aad u fiican.
This will not end well.	Tani si wanaagsan kuma dhammaan doonto.
The same thing would happen.	Sidaas oo kale ayaa dhici lahayd.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
I pretended not to understand	Waxaan iska dhigay inaanan fahmin
I felt surprised.	Waxaan dareemay yaab.
But she did not return.	Laakiin ma ay soo noqon.

Very, very true.	Aad iyo aad run u ah.
In fact, that is a bit of a lie.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa xoogaa been ah.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
But she did as she was told.	Laakiin sidii lagu yidhi way samaysay.

I can't say, not even you	Ma sheegi karo, xitaa adiga
Several times she did not have it	Dhowr jeer ma aysan haysan
There are only three.	Waxaa jira saddex kaliya.

There are some strange things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo yaab leh.

I have to do it, but still	Waa inaan sameeyo, laakiin weli

I knew there must be something	Waan ogaa inay tahay inay wax jiraan
I would like to go more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan aado wax badan.
Many other things, of course, but this is not the case.	Waxyaabo kale oo badan, waa hubaal, laakiin tan maaha.

He will get it right.	Si sax ah ayuu u heli doonaa.
He took it seriously.	Si dhab ah ayuu u qaatay.
I heard him coming, and I felt	Waxaan maqlay isaga oo ku soo socda, oo waxaan dareemay
Really, really good.	Runtii, runtii aad u wanaagsan.
I would leave	waan bixi lahaa
As it is, there is nothing we can do.	Sida ay tahay, ma jiraan wax aan sameyn karno.
Also beautiful and solid.	Sidoo kale qurux badan oo adag.
That is nothing, but it is also nothing.	Taasi waxba maaha, laakiin sidoo kale maaha wax.

I think it is beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan tahay
I will not go	Ma tagi doono
I just decided it couldn’t be you	Kaliya waxaan go'aansaday inaysan adiga noqon karin

I will say more later.	Dib ayaan wax badan ka odhan doonaa.
I hope you can do the same	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli karto
In fact, he was.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu ahaa.
Obviously not.	Waxaa cad in aysan ahayn.
As everyone does the same thing.	Sida qof walba u sameeyo wax la mid ah.
It's even better.	Xitaa way ka fiican tahay.

I have been here before.	Hore ayaan halkan u joogay.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
You said you wanted to.	Waxaad sheegtay inaad rabto.
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
There is nothing complicated.	Ma jiraan wax dhib badan.
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
I think he is serious	Waxaan filayaa inuu dhab ka yahay
Mostly no problem.	Inta badan dhib ma lahayn.
I want you to say nothing	Waxaan rabaa inaadan waxba sheegin
I'm afraid he did	Waxaan ka baqayaa inuu sameeyay
I went to talk to you, but you were not there	Waxaan u tagay inaan kula hadlo, laakiin ma aadan joogin
There is no truth.	Run ma jirto.
That is not a problem.	Taasi dhib maaha.
I told him he could leave at any time	Waxaan u sheegay inuu bixi karo wakhti kasta
That's right.	Waa sax.
I think you can't win together	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaadan wada guulaysan karin
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I do not understand why this is so	Ma fahmin sababta ay tani sidaas u tahay
They still do.	Weli way sameeyaan.
I didn't even want to say anything else	Xitaa maan rabin inuu wax kale sheego
I never stopped working	Weligay maan joojin shaqada
uma eka.	uma eka.
Maybe it was true.	Malaha run bay ahayd.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
I only hope for the latter	Waxaan rajeynayaa kaliya kan dambe
We were like one person.	Waxaan ahayn sida hal qof.
She would leave.	Way iska tagi lahayd.
To see one refused me.	Si aan u arko mid ka mid ah ayaa i diiday.
You can leave at any time.	Waad iska bixi kartaa wakhti kasta.
Something difficult.	Wax adag.
I can help you and I can help myself	Waan ku caawin karaa oo waan is caawin karaa
I need to talk to you in person	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof ahaan kula hadlo
I tried, first.	Waxaan isku dayay, marka hore.
I have to know what is going on	Waa inaan ogaado waxa socda
As you are now.	Sida aad hadda tahay.
It can be anything, really.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax, runtii.
I think that is enough	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ku filan tahay
I just put it in the living room	Kaliya waxaan dhigay qolka qolka
It was great to have it back	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in dib loo helo
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I just don’t know enough about it.	Kaliya ma garanayo wax igu filan.
There is nothing worse.	Wax ka xun ma jiraan.
But this is a lie.	Laakiin tani waa been.
I would love to see that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko
I have not found another like it	Ma aan helin mid kale oo la mid ah
I have something to do now	Waxaan hayaa wax aan sameeyo hadda
I really want to be with you	Waxaan aad u rabaa inaan kula joogo
I do not want it any other way	Ma rabo si kale
Sure, everyone is.	Hubaal, qof walba waa.
I couldn't tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegi karin.
I like that everyone is at home.	Waxaan jeclahay in qof walba uu guriga joogo.
But there was nothing new there.	Laakiin ma jirin wax ku cusub halkaas.
I thought it would be a quick job.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon doonto shaqo degdeg ah.
I wanted him, all of him	Isaga waan rabay, isaga oo dhan
What's up there.	Maxaa halkaas ka jira.
I really wanted to see you again	Waxaan aad u rabay inaan mar kale ku arko
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I just don’t know what else to do.	Kaliya ma garanayo wax kale oo aan sameeyo.
I was very upset	Aad baan uga baxay
Let him do what he wants.	Ha sameeyo wuxuu rabo.
I have not seen anyone interesting	Ma aanan arag qof xiiso leh
I wanted to talk to him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo.
Obviously you don't know anything about it.	Waxaa cad in aadan waxba ka ogeyn.
I was surprised, but	Waan yaabay, laakiin
I really think so.	Runtii sidaas ayaan u malaynayaa.
That is what you do.	Taasi waa waxa aad sameyso.
That should not be difficult.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon mid adag.
I knew this was going to happen	Waan ogaa inay tani dhici doonto
He never knew who he was	Waligiis ma uu garanayn cidda uu yahay
I set and.	Waxaan dhigay iyo.
I love how small everyone is	Waxaan jeclahay sida qof walba u yar yahay
But it is impossible.	Laakiin waa wax aan dhici karin.
A real living man	Nin nool oo dhab ah
I wanted something similar	Waxaan rabay wax la mid ah
He liked the job.	Shaqada wuu ka helay.
si cad.	si cad.
What happened now.	Maxaa dhacay hadda.
Pick it up	Soo qaado
He knows it's not.	Wuu ogyahay in aanay ahayn.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan ayaa ku jira.
You just need to do something.	Kaliya waxaad u baahan tahay inaad wax sameyso.
I know you must have known something	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad wax ogaatay
I need some truth.	Waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa run ah.
I can do anything for everyone	Wax walba waan u samayn karaa qof walba
I can't do anything wrong	Wax xun ma samayn karo
I do not know you.	kuma garanayo.
It will be a good time.	Waxay noqon doontaa waqti fiican.
I did not find that later	Waqti dambe uma helin taas
I wonder if he is happy.	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii uu faraxsan yahay.
he loves you	wuu ku jecel yahay
I always paid	Had iyo jeer waan bixin jiray
I want to talk to you	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
Which, of course, he did.	Taas oo, si, uu sameeyay.
I wonder where he is	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka uu joogo
I would see everyone again	Waxaan arki lahaa qof walba mar kale
There was nothing better tomorrow.	Berri wax ka wanaagsan ma jirin.
I have everything tonight	Wax walba waan hayaa caawa
I think that makes you like it	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi adiga kugu jeceshahay
I have a lot of friends here	Waxaan halkan ku leeyahay saaxiibo badan
It was a lucky day.	Waxay ahayd maalin nasiib badan.
It was not real.	Ma ahayn mid dhab ah.
I tried to do it again	Waxaan isku dayay inaan mar kale sameeyo
There was still something wrong.	Weli waxaa jiray wax aan sax ahayn.
I want to be with you again	Waxaan rabaa inaan mar kale i noqdo
I hope you are good too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale wanaagsan tahay.
He knows what is going on.	Waxa jira wuu garanayaa.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
I can't afford much like that	Wax badan oo la mid ah ma bixin karo
And very good too.	Iyo mid aad u fiican sidoo kale.
I think you said enough.	Waxaan filayaa inaad wax kugu filan sheegtay.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
I could not allow that	Ma ogolaan karin taas
This is not correct.	Tani maaha mid sax ah.
Take it with you.	Ku qaado.
I used to help with that	Taas waan ka caawin jiray
I hope you really like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad runtii jeceshahay
I will never hurt you.	Weligay waxba ku yeeli maayo.
I know it was urgent	Waan ogahay in ay degdeg ahayd
I really hope so	Runtii taas ayaan kuu rajeynayaa
And that she loves me.	Iyo in ay i jeceshahay.
I looked at each one	Mid walba ayaan eegay
It really did.	Runtii waa la sameeyay.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Lama garanayo iyo in kale.
I think it was great	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd wax weyn
He really wants it.	Runtii aad buu u rabaa.
I want to be a good person.	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof wanaagsan.
I hope it will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
I need you to do it hard	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad si adag u sameyso
I had to go home	Waxay ahayd inaan guriga aado
So beautiful.	Si aad u qurux badan.
I did not stay home for long	Ma aanan joogin guriga waqti badan
That is the only way to stop it.	Taasi waa sida kaliya ee lagu joojin karo.
I really need to find a friend	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan helo saaxiib
I doubt they will give you any trouble	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay ku siin doonaan dhibaato kasta
I am not one.	Anigu mid ma ihi.
I can't afford a job	Ma awoodo inaan shaqo helo
I can't take much of this	Wax badan kama qaadan karo tan
I really know what you are doing	Dhab ahaan waan ogahay waxaad samaynayso
I may not get another job anymore	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mar dambe shaqo kale helin
Maybe nothing comes of it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan waxba ka soo bixin.
That was a bad idea.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad xun.
This will not do.	Tani ma yeeli doonto.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
Certainly never did	Hubaal weligay ma samayn
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
Whatever he says, he is right.	Wax kasta oo uu sheego, waa sax.
Well.	Si wanaagsan.
We'll see what she does.	Waan arki doonaa waxay sameyso.
I found it quickly and beautifully	Waxaan u helay si degdeg ah oo qurux badan
I felt owed	Waxaan dareemay in la igu leeyahay
Do not take too much.	Wax badan ha qaadan.
There was nothing new to eat at home.	Guriga ma jirin wax cusub oo la cuno.
I told him it was found	Waxaan u sheegay in la helay
I really need to know how to do it	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sida loo sameeyo
It is a difficult place.	Waa meel dhib badan.
I had a great time	Waxaan helay waqti aad u fiican
I certainly did not want to	Hubaal maan rabin
I felt more there than before	Waxaan ka dareemay halkaas in ka badan sidii hore
I just can't leave him	Kaliya kama tagi karo isaga
I know this is hard for you right now	Waan ogahay in tani ay kugu adag tahay hadda
Well done, maybe.	Si aad u wanaagsan loo sameeyay, malaha.
I would pay	waan bixin lahaa
I heard something again.	Mar kale ayaan wax maqlay.
It has everything.	Waxay leedahay wax walba.
Where he was.	Meesha uu joogay.
It was very accurate.	Aad bay sax u ahayd.
I looked very much	Aad baan u eegay
She can do anything.	Wax walba way samayn kartaa.
I have never seen anything as amazing as this	Weligay ma arag wax la yaab leh oo tan la mid ah
It just wasn’t very fun.	Kaliya ma ahayn mid aad u xiiso badan.
I know how he feels.	Waan ogahay sida uu dareemayo.
If you will let me, that is.	Haddii aad ii ogolaan doonto, taasi waa.
I will give you time to do the same	Waxaan ku siin doonaa waqti aad ku sameyso sidaas oo kale
I wanted to buy it	Waxaan rabay inaan iibsado
I did not have many friends	Maan lahayn saaxiibo badan
I am one of the happy ones.	Anigu mid ayaan ku faraxsanahay.
It's hard not to like him.	Way adag tahay inaanan jeclayn isaga.
But it was.	Laakiin sidaas bay ahayd.
I knew you would like it	Waan ogaa inaad jeclaan lahayd
is it you 	waa adiga?
I know you must be very fond of it	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad aad u jeceshahay
I know now it's time, not if.	Waan ogahay hadda inay mar tahay, maaha haddii.
I have a lot of things to do	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo badan oo aan sameeyo
You are very happy.	Aad baad u faraxsan tahay.
I should not have told him	Ma ahayn inaan u sheego
I was told that would help	Waxaa la ii sheegay in ay taasi caawin doonto
I just can't do anything here	Kaliya halkan waxba kuma qaban karo
But that was a long time ago	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor
I think it's too bad.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u xun tahay.
They will talk.	Way hadli doonaan.
I did not see you here tonight	Halkan kuma arag caawa
I could not go to school today	Maanta maan aadi karin dugsiga
That is not all.	Taasi kaliya maaha.
I have a job to go to	Waxaan hayaa shaqo aan tago
I have to be very sure	Waa inaan aad u hubaa
I want to see.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko.
I could not let him do it	Uma ogolaan karin inuu sameeyo
I will not talk to him	La hadli maayo
He said this is the least he can do.	Waxa uu sheegay in tani ay tahay waxa ugu yar ee uu sameyn karo.
came back to me.	igu soo noqday.
I did not want to say anything	Ma rabin in aan wax u sheego
And very little.	Iyo mid aad u yar.
I just want to talk to you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
But me.	Laakiin aniga.
You can also get paid.	Waxaad sidoo kale heli kartaa lacag.
I can really do that	Runtii taas waan samayn karaa
No one can do that.	Qofna taas kuma yeeli karo.
I have nowhere to go	Meel la igama hayo ma jirto
I would tell you	waan kuu sheegi lahaa
I have friends here	Waxaan halkan ku leeyahay saaxiibo
There are things going on right now.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo hadda socda.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
But not much.	Laakiin ma badna.
I can't do much	Wax badan ma samayn karo
It may not be over yet.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uusan weli dhammaan.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
He really said	Runtii wuu yidhi
I am happy to be there	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaas sii joogo
I could not do anything.	Waxba maan qaban karin.
I don't want anything	waxba ma rabo
She rejected him.	Way diiday isaga.
I never went to see him.	Weligay ma aan tagin inaan arko.
I can see you.	Waan ku arki karaa adiga.
This will not be.	Tani ma ahaan doonto.
One here and one there.	Mid halkan iyo mid jira.
That is not wise.	Taasi caqli maaha.
First.	Marka hore.
I will go now	Hadda waan tagi doonaa
I no longer liked him	Mar dambe maan jeclayn isaga
That was not true.	Taasi run ma ahayn.
This is good now.	Tani way fiican tahay hadda.
That may be correct.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sax.
It has been a long time, for sure.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer, hubaal.
This is what he likes to do.	Tani waa waxa uu jecel yahay inuu sameeyo.
I was once rejected	Mar waa la ii diiday
I do not know who she is	Ma garanayo cidda ay tahay
I wanted to be somewhere else, somewhere	Waxaan rabay inaan joogo meel kale, meel kale
"Don't understand me," he said.	Ha i fahmin ayuu yidhi.
I do not have to leave for a long time	Ma ahan in aan waqti dheer baxo
Not much.	Ma badna.
I thought everything was fine	Waxaan u maleeyay in wax walba ay fiican yihiin
But she did not come.	Laakiin ma ay iman.
Tomorrow is again.	Berri waxaa mar kale.
Today she refuses to go to school.	Maanta way diiday inay aado dugsiga.
That was a lot more.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
Not everyone got everything.	Qof kastaa ma helin wax kasta.
I can't stay here anymore	Ma sii joogi karo halkan mar dambe
You may not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan ahayn.
I hope you like it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay
You certainly can't be that.	Hubaal ma ahaan kartid taas .
I keep him	Waan sii hayaa isaga
I told him it was not urgent	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay degdeg ahayn
I really had to learn	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan barto
I would not give one	Ma siin lahaa mid
That is, there is no such thing.	Taasi waa, ma jiraan wax la mid ah.
I really don't want this	Runtii ma rabin tan
He made me.	Wuu iga dhigay.
I didn't really like that	Aad uma aan jeclayn taas
It was not a man's job.	Ma ahayn shaqada nin.
I think so, he thought to himself	Waxaan filayaa, ayuu is yidhi
It was already time to go.	Waxay ahayd mar hore markii la tagi lahaa.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan.
I did not know what he wanted	Wax uu rabo maan ogayn
He has not come home yet.	Weli guriga ma iman.
I need to tell him	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan u sheego isaga
He wondered who he was.	Waxa uu is waydiiyay waa kuma.
I always have something to say	Had iyo jeer waxaan hayaa wax aan sheego
Very small, but really	Mid aad u yar, laakiin runtii
Close to home	U dhow guriga
I have nothing else to say here	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan halkan ka sheego
It was really beautiful.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
There is still time.	Weli wakhti ayaa jira.
I did not want to tell him	Uma doonayn inaan u sheego isaga
I would think.	Waxaan u malayn lahaa.
I think the most obvious	Waxaan filayaa in ugu cad
I saw it all.	Waan wada arkay.
As before, so be it.	Sidii hore, sidaas oo kale.
But he never liked it.	Laakiin waligiis ma jeclayn.
New thing?.	Wax cusub?.
I felt that this was something else	Waxaan dareemay in tani ay tahay wax kale
He did it for me.	Wuu ii sameeyay.
I wish I could be better.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan noqdo mid aad u fiican.
I can see it there	Halkaas ayaan ka arki karaa
I want to keep it that way now	Waxaan rabaa in aan sidaas ku sii hayo hadda
More than ever.	In ka badan sidii hore.
I did not understand what he was saying	Maan fahmin waxa uu leeyahay
I found what was in you	Waan helay waxa kugu jira
We probably won't see it again.	Waxay u badan tahay inaanan dib u arki doonin.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
You do not have to do anything.	Ma aha inaad wax samayso.
Give me time.	Waqti i sii.
I want to know exactly what happened	Waxaan rabaa inaan si sax ah u ogaado waxa dhacay
He felt everything.	Wax walba wuu dareemay.
I have not had time for this.	Waqti uma aan helin tan.
I did not want to, first of all.	Maan rabin, marka hore.
It was a great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
I have a lot of things to do	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo badan oo aan sameeyo
We will still do something together.	Weli wax waanu wada samayn doonaa.
Everything as.	Wax walba sida.
I will not say.	ku odhan maayo.
It may come back a long time ago.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu soo noqdo wakhti dheer ka hor.
I knew he was smart	Waan ogaa inuu caqli badan yahay
Nothing ever.	Wax waligiis ma aha.
A lot.	Wax badan.
I think he is fine	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu fiican yahay
I only love you	adiga kaliya ayaan kuu jeclahay
This was very difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan.
This is good for that.	Tani way ku fiican tahay taas.
I gave everything and tried everything else	Wax walba waan siiyay oo wax walba oo kale ayaan isku dayay
I told her that but it will go away.	Taas ayaan u sheegay laakiin way tagi doontaa.
But he would.	Laakiin wuu yeeli lahaa.
I want to see people get enough food	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko dadka oo helay cunto ku filan
I think that's enough.	Waxaan filayaa inay ku filan tahay.
It wasn’t too big.	Ma ahayn mid aad u weyn.
Let it do.	Ha sameeyo.
I would not allow him to say	Uma ogolaan lahaa inuu sheego
I decided to take a chance	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan fursad u helo
I think he was surprised	Waxaan filayaa inuu la yaabay
I also think this is a good idea	Waxaan sidoo kale u maleynayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan
I have no money now	Hadda lacag ma haysto
It was a great day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u fiican.
You just couldn’t see it.	Kaliya ma aad arki karin.
This is enough for me	Waxaa igu filan tan
I was just really there	Runtii kaliya ayaan jiray
I knew she would see him	Waan ogaa inay arki doonto isaga
This was very, very bad.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad iyo aad u xun.
At first I had no idea	Markii hore wax fikrad ah kama helin
I want to do more.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan sameeyo.
It may be correct.	Waxay noqon kartaa sax.
I had a good time.	Waxaan soo qaatay waqti fiican.
I need food	Waxaan u baahanahay cunto
That’s where you can help, you know.	Taasi waa meesha aad ka caawin karto, waad ogtahay.
I really think they are beautiful	Waxaan runtii u maleynayaa inay qurux badan yihiin
It can no longer be done	Mar dambe lama qaban karo
I'll be back	Dib ayaan ugu soo noqon doonaa
I am whatever you can be	Waxaan ahay wax walba oo aad noqon karto
Probably a little earlier	Wax yar ka hor malaha
If nothing else, there was everything to be done.	Haddii aysan jirin wax, waxaa jiray wax kasta oo la sameeyo.
I told him that.	Taas ayaan u sheegay.
Obviously, I didn’t like the way she did it.	Sida cad, ma jeclayn sida ay u samaysay.
But for the most part it is really correct.	Laakiin inta badan runtii waa sax.
I have not seen it yet	Ilaa hadda maan arag
But he must.	Laakiin waa inuu.
I do not know why he is here	Ma garanayo sababta uu halkan u joogo
It certainly won’t be permanent.	Hubaal ma ahaan doonto mid joogto ah.
Now I have heard.	Hadda ayaan maqlay.
That's right friend.	Waa sax saaxiib.
One has.	Mid qabo.
I really could not tell	Dhab ahaan uma sheegi karin
He would be.	Wuxuu noqon lahaa.
You can see it here and here.	Waxaad ku arki kartaa halkan iyo halkan.
To make it harder.	Si loo sameeyo mid adag.
That cannot be true.	In aanay run noqon karin.
I hope you can see that this is true	Waxaan filayaa inaad arki karto in tani run tahay
I wanted to help people	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo dadka
I was ready for this	Diyaar baan u ahaa tan
Which is really amazing.	Taas oo runtii aan la yaab lahayn.
I hope you do well	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad wax wanaagsan ku sameyso
I would like	waan jeclaan lahaa
You can do better.	Si fiican ayaad u samayn kartaa.
I did not think so.	Uma malaynayn.
I want you to know everything	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax walba ogaato
I only had one man	Waxa aan lahaa hal nin oo kaliya
I did not have time for that	Waqti uma helin taas
I love you for that	Waan kaa jeclahay taas
A little bit of everything	In yar oo wax walba ah
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
This is also true in another way.	Tani sidoo kale waa run si kale.
Something similar happened to me.	Wax la mid ah ayaa igu dhacay.
That is a big problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato weyn.
I will not talk like that.	Anigu ma hadli doono sidaas.
He told you he still loves you, he can't stay here.	Wuxuu kuu sheegay inuu wali ku jecel yahay, halkaan kuma sii joogi karo.
No one knows everything.	Qofna wax walba ma yaqaan.
It's a terrible thing.	Waa wax aad u xun.
I can provide you with everything you need and more	Waxaan ku siin karaa dhammaan waxaad u baahan tahay iyo wax ka badan
As she had.	Sidii ay lahayd.
Tell others.	Dadka kale u sheeg.
I want to tell them.	Waxaan rabaa inaan u sheego.
I owe you a great deal of time	Waqti weyn ayaan kugu leeyahay taas
He really left.	Runtii wuu baxay.
I did not get to see much	In badan maan helin inaan arko
I told him there was no need for that	Waxaan u sheegay inaan loo baahnayn taas
I did not have long.	Ma aanan haysan waqti dheer.
They love this.	Way jecel yihiin tan.
I want that	taas ayaan rabaa
A good job would help	Shaqo wanaagsan ayaa ku caawin lahayd
And to talk.	Iyo in la hadlo.
I got that from him	Taas isaga ayaan ka helay
He felt very well.	Aad buu u dareemay.
You are a very smart man.	nin caqli badan baad tahay.
I wanted to be here for you	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaan kuu joogo
I have never been to one	Weligay mid maan tagin
I have no idea what happened to him.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay.
I thought it was very good	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u fiican tahay
Yes, yes.	Waa sii, waa.
I just don't know how yet.	Kaliya ma garanayo sida weli.
Everyone was everyone.	Qof kasta oo ahaa qof kasta.
I will always love you	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa
I also know he liked what you would say	Waxa kale oo aan ogahay in uu ka helay waxaad odhan lahayd
But you can let me do that later.	Laakiin waad ii ogolaan kartaa taas mar dambe.
I thought you wanted to know.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad rabto inaad ogaato.
And so on, and so forth.	Iyo wixii la mid ah, iyo wixii la mid ah.
I never thought of that	Weligay uma malaynayn taas
And earlier.	Oo hore.
I just didn't want to talk	Kaliya ma rabin inaan hadlo
I did not know what he wanted from me	Maan garanayn waxa uu iga rabo
I just wanted to go to work	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan shaqo tago
And you can't be better.	Oo ma fiicnaan kartid.
I was a little surprised.	Waan yara yaabay.
He could not allow her to do this	Uma ogolaan karin inuu tan sameeyo
As before.	Sidii hore oo kale.
I had a great time	Waxaan helay waqti aad u fiican
I can't see	Ma arki karo
so I used to be.	sidaas ayaan ahaan jiray.
I did not say this to stay with you	Tan uma odhan si aan kuu sii joogo
They will for sure.	Waxay hubaal noqon doonaan.
He would tell you everything.	Wax walba wuu kuu sheegi lahaa.
Not that he really is.	Ma aha in uu dhab ahaantii yahay.
I don't know what it is.	Ma garanayo waxa ay tahay.
I could not	Waan awoodi waayay
But she had.	Laakiin way lahayd.
I hope that will happen soon	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi dhawaan dhici doonto
It's hard.	Way adag tahay.
It was very good.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I should have told you how beautiful you are	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu sheego sida aad u qurux badan tahay
I know him very well	Aad ayaan u garanayaa isaga
There was none.	Ma jirin.
He was at work.	Waxa uu ahaa shaqada.
It has no place.	Waxba meel ma leh.
I want to go home as well	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga sidoo kale
You can only do your best.	Waxaad samayn kartaa oo kaliya sida ugu fiican.
Good thing, too.	Wax fiican, sidoo kale.
I know you can do better	Waan ogahay inaad si fiican u samayn karto
He told her she could go back.	Wuxuu u sheegay inay dib u bixi karto.
I really want him.	Aad ayaan u rabaa isaga.
There was a lot.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
Not so good.	Si fiican uma aha.
That is what got me.	Taasi waa waxa i helay.
There was nothing else out there.	Ma jirin wax kale oo halkaas ka baxay.
It is so beautiful here.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay halkan.
He really did.	Runtii wuu galay.
They are friends	Waa saaxiibo
In fact, it would be nice if so.	Dhab ahaantii, way fiicnaan lahayd sidaas.
I did not know where to go	Meel aan aadi karno maan garanayn
I can give you everything	Wax walba waan ku siin karaa
Is that correct.	Ma sax baa.
Tell them about it.	U sheeg taas.
I can come back tomorrow to talk to him	Berri waan soo noqon karaa si aan ula hadlo isaga
They should not even be here.	Waa inaysan xitaa halkan joogin.
I said something that was not true	Wax baan ka sheegay in aanu run ahayn
Not yet spoken	Wali lama hadlin
I hope he is still fine	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu weli fiican yahay
It sounds like a good idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad wanaagsan.
I asked him where he lived	Waxa aan waydiiyay halka uu ku nool yahay
Again and again and again and again and again.	Mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale.
I won't say much about it today.	Wax badan ka sheegi maayo maanta.
Only once.	Kaliya hal mar.
I wanted to know why.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sababta.
I didn't get much food	Cunto badan ma helin
it's you.	waa adiga .
I wanted you to know	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
I can't do it more than once	Wax ka badan hal mar ma samayn karo
How amazing.	Sidee aad u yaab badan.
I did it to help you	Waxaan u sameeyay inaan ku caawiyo
It has been a long time coming.	Waxay ahayd meel waqti dheer.
He knew what we were.	Wuu ogaa waxa aanu nahay.
I know how much.	Waan ogahay inta.
Do nothing where you are.	Meesha aad joogto waxba ha ku samayn.
I thought it was so much better	Waxaan u maleeyay inay sidaas ka fiican tahay
This is great.	Tani waa wax weyn.
Not the best, not the worst.	Ma aha kan ugu fiican, ma aha kan ugu xun.
Anything else, too.	Wax kale, sidoo kale.
I still did.	Wali waan sameeyay.
I have no place for a man	Meel uma hayo nin
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
I think it is good for you	Waxaan filayaa inay adiga kugu fiican tahay
I wanted to be a person	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo qof
I will not go.	Ma tagi doono.
It was the same thing, it was real.	Waxay ahayd wax la mid ah, waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
Not the best person, but still the best for me.	Ma aha qof ugu fiican, laakiin weli aniga ii fiican.
I know more than you	Waan ogahay in ka badan adiga
I know you can do it	Waan ogahay inaad sameyn karto
But he would come back.	Laakiin wuu soo noqon lahaa.
Today.	Maanta.
Not at all.	Ma aha oo dhan.
I am very sorry about that	Aad ayaan uga xumahay taas
But not first.	Laakiin marka hore maaha.
I know that, too.	Waan ogahay taas, sidoo kale.
i love you friend	waan ku jeclahay saaxiib
It was familiar.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaqaan.
They are things.	Waa waxyaabo.
They are very serious.	Aad bay dhab u yihiin.
you did nothing.	waxba ma aadan samayn.
Maybe it's you.	Malaha waa adiga.
Whenever he wanted to.	Mar kasta oo uu rabay.
But it has only one.	Laakiin waxay leedahay hal kaliya.
I can't really tell you the job you need.	Si dhab ah uma sheegi karo shaqada aad u baahan tahay.
Maybe he still surprised me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli ila yaabay.
Even more so than it was now.	Xitaa in ka badan sidii ay hadda ahayd.
I'm sorry for him	Waan ku xumahay isaga
You are someone else.	Waxaad tahay qof kale.
I felt it existed	Waxa aan dareemay in ay jirto
He left a lot, let a lot go.	Aad buu uga tagay, wax badan ha baxo.
he can give you.	wuu ku siin karaa.
I wondered what he was doing	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu samaynayo
Everyone wanted to talk to him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu la hadlo.
I have to say.	waa inaan leeyahay.
I need to do this urgently	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan si degdeg ah u sameeyo
It could be me.	Waxay noqon kartaa aniga.
She was not told what she could do, where she would go.	Lama sheegin waxa ay sameyn karto, halka ay aadi doonto.
To make money.	Si lacag loo sameeyo.
I saw it all	Waxaan arkay wax dhan
This is a good thing and a bad thing.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan oo xun.
I really don't know much.	Runtii wax badan kama garanayo.
It looks like a lot of work.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo badan.
I can't stay now	Ma sii joogi karo hadda
In fact, there is more than one.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa jira wax ka badan hal.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha.
I couldn’t think of anything else to do there	Ma u malayn karin wax kale oo aan halkaas ku sameeyo
They will surely return.	Waxa hubaal ah inay soo noqon doonaan.
I want more to stay	Waxaan rabaa wax badan inaan joogo
I'm happy, really.	Waan ku faraxsanahay, runtii.
I would definitely do this again	Dhab ahaantii waan samayn lahaa tan mar kale
But that's just it.	Laakiin taasi kaliya.
I am surprised now.	Waxaan la yaabay hadda.
I just didn’t have time	Kaliya wakhti uma helin
Maybe I can learn from you	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax kaa barto
I don't want to talk about him anymore.	Ma doonayo inaan mar dambe ka hadlo isaga.
I know he won't be here tonight	Waan ogahay inuusan halkan joogi doonin caawa
I will not do that.	Ma yeeli doono taas.
I was there	Halkaas ayaan la joogay
I want you to love me too	Waxaan rabaa inaad sidoo kale i jeceshahay
This was an opportunity to do something.	Tani waxay ahayd fursad wax lagu sameeyo.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
It is a beautiful day.	Waa maalin qurux badan.
This she did.	Tani way samaysay.
It can also be very difficult.	Waxa kale oo laga yaabaa inay aad u adag tahay.
I think you have enough trouble	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad dhib kugu filan tahay
It will not be good.	Ma fiicnaan doonto.
I think they are beautiful	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan yihiin
No one was present for a while	In muddo ah cidna lama aan joogin
I really know what's going on here	Runtii waan ogahay waxa halkan ka socda
I really don't understand.	Runtii ma fahmin.
I think it was a real surprise for him	Waxaan filayaa inay yaab dhab ah ku ahayd isaga
I know what I want and how to get it.	Waan garanayaa waxa aan rabo iyo sida loo helo.
I still want everything good.	Weli waxaan rabaa wax walba oo wanaagsan.
Nice to see you again	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko
I can't believe what happened now	Ma rumaysan karo waxa hadda dhacay
She was a friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib.
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
It is always there.	Had iyo jeer waa halkaas.
I did not want everyone at school to know	Ma aanan rabin in qof walba oo dugsiga ka socda uu ogaado
I will never do that	Weligay taas ma yeeli doono
He did not want to leave	Ma rabin inuu baxo
That is not who we are.	Taasi maaha cidda aan nahay.
You did a great job.	Waxaad samaysay shaqo aad u fiican.
I can only go	Kaliya waan tagi karaa
I have also seen it before	Waxaan sidoo kale hore u arkay
This is the same.	Tani waa la mid.
I can do good things	Wax wanaagsan waan samayn karaa
Take who you need and how much you want.	Qaado cidda aad u baahan tahay iyo inta aad rabto.
I am afraid of what this could do to us.	Waxaan ka baqayaa waxa ay tani nagu samayn karto.
I knew what was coming	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda
I want to talk to you	waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
It was a time problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato waqti.
I had no friends, no job, and no money	Maan lahayn saaxiib, shaqo, iyo wax lacag ah
I do not have time to find out.	Ma hayo wakhti aan ku ogaado.
Not at all.	Ma kan.
Anytime, anywhere.	Waqti kasta, meel kasta.
That is what he always does.	Taasi waa waxa uu had iyo jeer sameeyo.
I still wanted to go home	Waxaan weli rabay inaan guriga aado
No one else can do it, either.	Qof kale waxba uma samayn karo, sidoo kale.
I wish it was not so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
I want to know everything she has to tell us.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wax kasta oo ay tahay inay noo sheegto.
I was a great man.	Waxaan ahaa nin weyn.
I think it is much better	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad uga fiican tahay
Nice to see you	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko
It really is nothing new.	Runtii maaha wax cusub.
But it did not turn out well.	Laakiin si fiican uma ay noqon.
He had nowhere to go.	Ma jirin meel uu aado.
I did not have time for this	Waqti uma helin tan
Everyone is happy with him.	Qof kastaa waa ku faraxsan yahay isaga.
I can do that here	Taas waan ka samayn karaa halkan
I have to go to him first	Waa inaan marka hore u tago isaga
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I am in trouble.	Waxaan ku jiraa dhibaato.
Now, not too much.	Hadda, aad uma badna.
I'm sure she would like it	Waan hubaa inay jeclaan lahayd
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii cad.
This will be fine.	Tani way fiicnaan doontaa.
I hope we can be friends	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqon karno saaxiibo
In fact, you should.	Dhab ahaantii, waa inaad.
Don't take that lightly.	Ha u qaadan in yar taas.
I asked if it was true, really	Waxaan waydiiyay inay run tahay, runtii
I hope to be there tomorrow	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaas joogo berrito
I am very sorry for him	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga
It may not be anything else.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanu oo aanu noqon karin wax kale.
She told me she loved me.	Waxay ii sheegtay inay i jeceshahay.
I will not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegi doono.
I will never leave here.	Weligay halkan kama tagi doono.
I wonder how long he has been here	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta uu halkan joogay
I had to find out what happened.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxa dhacay.
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
I know you will not do anything about it	Waan ogahay inaadan waxba ka qaban doonin
I did	waan sameeyay
Not until someone else wants it.	Ma aha ilaa qof kale doonayo.
Too much money	Lacag aad u badan
I have tried this before	Mar hore ayaan tan isku dayay
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I want to talk to you a little bit	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax yar kula hadlo
That was how much he could handle now.	Taasi waxay ahayd inta uu hadda wax ka qaban karo.
I looked around the room again	Qolka ayaan mar kale eegay
Most have not yet been reported.	Inta badan wali lama sheegin.
you would be right	sax baad ahaan lahayd
That's right.	Taas oo sax ah.
I think that is amazing	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay tahay waxa yaab leh
This is correct.	Tani waa sax.
There are few.	In yar ayaa jira.
I will deal with it here	halkaan ayaan wax ka qaban doonaa
I wonder where she is	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka ay joogto
It’s always me.	Had iyo jeer waa aniga.
I could not stop in time	Waqti ayaan ku joojin waayay
This is the maximum I will pay.	Tani waa inta ugu badan ee aan bixin doono.
I will never catch him.	Weligay ma qaban doono isaga.
It can take.	Way qaadan kartaa.
And, well.	Iyo, si fiican.
She can't get to do that.	Ma heli karto in ay taas samayso.
She had an idea.	Waxay lahayd fikrad.
I did not.	Ma aanan.
I say so.	Anigu sidaas ayaan leeyahay.
I just want to help	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
They had to do a little.	Waxay ahayd inay sameeyaan wax yar.
I'm sure it will help	Waan hubaa inay ku caawin doonto
Sure, he would have left here nearby.	Hubaal, inuu halkan uga tagi lahaa meel u dhow.
Like tonight.	Sida caawa oo kale.
Not everyone wants to do that.	Qof kastaa ma rabo inuu taas sameeyo.
I actually fell for it	Dhab ahaantii waan ka dhacay
I looked around, but saw nothing	Waxaan eegay meel dhow, laakiin waxba ma arag
I will not see him again.	Mar dambe ma arki doono.
wait.	jira.
It was not hard to work with.	Ma ahayn mid adag inuu ka shaqeeyo.
He went everywhere to study.	Meel kasta ayuu aadi jiray si uu wax u barto.
At work	Shaqada
I liked how she did it.	Waxaan ka helay sida ay u samaysay.
I really did not understand	Runtii maan fahmin
I never knew otherwise.	Weligay si kale uma garanayn.
Now you are an adult.	Hadda waxaad tahay qof weyn.
I said nothing else.	Wax kale uma odhan.
I want to see it every day	Waxaan rabaa inaan maalin walba arko
In fact, he never did.	Dhab ahaantii, waligiis ma uu samayn.
I don't know who did it.	Ma garanayo cidda samaysay.
He refused to talk to me.	Wuu diiday inuu ila hadlo.
It's all very interesting.	Dhammaan waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
Lots of work but good	Shaqo badan laakiin fiican
She thinks so.	Aad bay kula tahay.
I want her to eat well	Waxaan rabaa inay si fiican wax u cunto
Maybe I asked him to do that	Malaha waxaan ka codsaday inuu taas sameeyo
you are me	adiga ayaa aniga ah
That doesn't matter to me.	Taasi waxba igama aha.
I would always be fine	Had iyo jeer waan fiicnaan lahaa
I know what he wants	Waan ogahay waxa uu rabo
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
I knew he would like that	Waan ogaa inuu taas jeclaan lahaa
He would always like to get more.	Wuxuu had iyo jeer jeclaan lahaa inuu helo wax badan.
And better here with us.	Oo halkaas ka wanaagsan halkan nala.
I don't think you can do that.	U malayn maayo inaad taas samayn karto.
No one wants anything.	Qofna waxba ma rabo.
I didn't tell him.	Uma sheegin.
But he did more than this.	Laakiin wuxuu sameeyay wax ka badan tan.
I can do better than you.	Waan samayn karaa si ka fiican adiga.
I did not know what he was going to do	Ma garanayn wuxuu u baxay inuu sameeyo
I don't want a place near me.	Ma rabo meel ii dhow.
I wanted her to tell me what she wanted	Waxaan rabay inay ii sheegto waxay rabto
I know what you said is true	Waan ogahay waxa aad tidhi waa run
Today was a good day.	Maanta waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
This is probably not true.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaysan run ahayn.
I hope he is.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu yahay.
I really want to.	Aad ayaan u rabaa.
She doesn't seem to have done so.	Uma eka inay sidaas samaysay.
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
I told him to go to work	Waxaan u sheegay inuu aado shaqada
It really is a problem.	Dhab ahaantii waa dhib.
I left the house	Waxaan ka baxay guriga
I wanted ready-made food	Waxaan rabay cunto diyaar ah oo diyaar ah
I am very sorry for him.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay isaga.
Who will believe this.	Yaa rumaysan doona tan.
Really great.	Run ahaantii weyn.
This is what I have tried so far.	Tani waa waxa aan isku dayay ilaa hadda.
I can't speak.	Ma hadli karo.
I will not tell anyone.	Cidna uma sheegi doono.
I want you to know that	Waxaan rabaa inaad taas ogaato
Now I look.	Hadda ayaan eegay.
Most do not.	Inta badan ma sameeyaan.
I could not see anyone	Qofna maan arki karin
And maybe.	Oo malaha.
I did not always do it right	Mar walba si sax ah uma sameyn jirin
They are really hard.	Runtii way adag yihiin.
I can't go now	Hadda ma tagi karo
Much, much better.	Wax badan, aad uga fiican.
Before.	Ka hor.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
I wish she was still here	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay weli halkan joogto
It will not stop	Ma joojin doono
For a while this was nothing.	In muddo ah tani waxba ma ahayn.
No one wants to go there.	Qofna ma rabo inuu halkaas aado.
He spent some time there.	Muddo yar ayuu halkaas ku qaatay.
He needs me.	Wuu ii baahan yahay.
So far she has not spoken	Ilaa hadda ma aysan hadlin
Everything is fine.	Wax walba waa wax wanaagsan.
Yesterday I asked her what she did	Shalay waxaan waydiiyay waxay samaysay
Spend time	Waqti ku bixi
He would have had a chance.	Fursad ayuu heli lahaa.
But, you did not help me.	Laakiin, ima aad caawin.
I am still there	wali waan joogaa
I will give you some food	Waxaan ku siin doonaa xoogaa cunto ah
He had to do that first.	Waxay ahayd in uu marka hore taas sameeyo.
That is a promise.	Taasi waa ballan.
I am very happy at home	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay guriga
I really did not know	Runtii anigu maan ogayn
I wanted you to love me	Waxaan rabay inaad i jeceshahay
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
He is almost ready	Wuxuu ku dhow yahay diyaar
I can't take a chance	Fursad ma qaadan karo
Whatever she did.	Wax kasta oo ay samaysay.
They are very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan yihiin.
I will definitely do that.	Hubaal taas waan samayn doonaa.
For a while no one saw him.	In muddo ah cidna ma uu arag.
One more time, please.	Hal mar oo kale, fadlan.
I know that for sure.	Waan ogahay taas hubaal.
We would not do that.	Ma yeeli lahayn taas.
This is too long.	Tani waa wax aad u dheer.

I had to find out where	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado meesha
I like.	Waan jeclahay.
They will believe.	Way rumaysan doonaan.
Everyone will love it.	Qof walba wuu jeclaan doonaa.
I want to know why he left	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta uu uga tagay
There is no better time than this.	Ma jiro waqti ka wanaagsan kan.
He just doesn’t want to do it.	Kaliya ma rabo inuu sameeyo.
It looks new.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid cusub.
I felt better than before	Waxaan dareemay wax ka fiican sidii hore
No problem.	Wax dhib ah ma leh.

It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
Done	La sameeyay
I knew it was difficult	Waan ogaa inay dhib tahay
I will help you	waan ku caawin doonaa

There is nothing better.	Wax ka fiican ma jiraan.
I knew you would.	Waan ogaa inaad yeeli doonto.
Something similar at home.	Wax la mid ah guriga.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
I want to stay	Waxaan rabaa inaan joogo
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.

I had to leave it all out	Waxay ahayd inaan ka tago dhammaan
I know what is best for you	Waan ogahay waxa kuu fiican

I'm glad you can come out	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad ka soo bixi karto
All hard '.	Adag oo dhan'.
I have to go to work tomorrow	Waa in aan shaqada aado berri
He knew how good he was.	Wuu ogaa sida uu u wanaagsan yahay.
Anyone can lie.	Qof kastaa wuu sheegi karaa been.
Both are not the same.	Labaduba isku mar maaha.
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
And I do not speak.	Oo ma hadlo.
Maybe he's sorry.	Malaha wuu ka xumahay.
I would do it again and again	Mar kale iyo mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa
But now that is good.	Laakiin hadda taasi way wanaagsan tahay.
I refused.	waan diiday.
I thought that was a good thing.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
I am here again	Mar kale ayaan joogaa
He did it to say something about it.	Wuxuu u sameeyay si uu wax uga sheego.
I told him what had happened	Waxa dhacay ayaan u sheegay
I really wanted to be	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan noqdo
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka tago.
I do not want to leave.	Ma rabo inaan baxo.
That is really true.	Runtii taasi waa sax.
I want to see you all the time	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko mar walba
I tried it after a while	Waxaan isku dayay muddo ka dib
Good man, good man	Nin wanaagsan, nin wanaagsan
This is bad.	Tani waa xun.
He could not leave.	Waa uu ka bixi waayay.
You like that.	Waad jeceshahay taas.
Now he would like it, too.	Hadda wuu jeclaan lahaa, sidoo kale.
But that is no longer the case.	Laakiin taasi hadda ma sii jirto.
I do not want to be one	Ma rabo in mid ku noqdo
I knew he would like it	Waan ogaa inuu jeclaan lahaa
Certainly no one came to me.	Hubaal qofna waxba igama iman.
I walked out the door.	Albaabka ayaan ka baxay.
I will not do it	Maan yeeli doonin
I would like to talk more about this	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ka sii hadlo arrintan
I can't do anything else.	Wax kale ma samayn karo.

I think it's too much.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u badan tahay.
I want to see who she is	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko cidda ay tahay

I had nothing.	waxba maan haysan.
I didn't think it would happen	Uma malaynayn inay dhici doonto
I never thought it was so big.	Weligay uma malaynayn inay sidaas u weyn tahay.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
Until recently, that is.	Ilaa dhawaan, taasi waa.

Something wanted me.	Wax baa i rabay.
I thought now might be a good time	Waxaan u maleeyay in hadda laga yaabo inay waqti fiican tahay

I do not know more than you.	Maan garanayn wax ka badan adiga.
I have nothing to do now	Wax aan sameeyo hadda ma hayo
Now you are interesting.	Hadda waxaad tahay mid xiiso leh.
I thought you wanted me.	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad aniga iga rabto.
I know how much she likes you	Waan ogahay inta ay ku jeceshahay

I need you to be there with me	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaas ila joogto
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
I think she can get away with it	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ka bixi karto
I can't leave home	Guriga kama bixi karo
I had to talk about it quickly	Waxay ahayd inaan si degdeg ah uga hadlo
Everything is better than nothing.	Wax kasta ayaa ka wanaagsan waxba.

I was with him several times.	Dhowr jeer ayaan la joogay.
Please do not think so.	Fadlan ha u malayn taas.
A little harder, a little faster	In yar ka adag, xoogaa degdeg ah
I actually have better things to do.	Dhab ahaantii waxaan hayaa waxyaabo ka fiican oo aan sameeyo.
If it's not for you, that's fine.	Haddii aysan adiga kuu ahayn, taasi waa fiican tahay.
I really didn't tell anyone	Runtii qofna uma sheegin
But for each of us.	Laakiin qof kasta oo naga mid ah.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa adag tahay.
I no longer want to do that	Mar dambe ma doonayo inaan taas sameeyo
I don't have time for that right now.	Waqti uma hayo taas hadda.
And that she did.	Iyo in ay samaysay.
I was lucky to have him.	Nasiib baan helay isaga.
me too	aniga ayaa kale
She didn't even see it.	Xitaa ma ay arag.
It was a difficult and difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti adag oo adag.
He knows nothing.	Waxba ma yaqaan.
I was a little surprised	Waan yara yaabay
It will be bad.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid xun.
This would have to be done.	Tani waxay noqon lahayd in la sameeyo.
I have no idea what it is	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay
I expect a bit too long	Waxaan filayaa in xoogaa aad u dheer
I have so much for you	Wax badan baan kuu hayaa
I really wanted to but could not	Runtii waan rabay laakiin ma awoodin
I asked her to take it all	Waxaan ka codsaday inay wada qaado
For me it is everything.	Aniga waa wax walba.
They will pay.	Way bixin doonaan.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
The same thing would happen.	Sidaas oo kale ayaa dhici lahayd.
I felt like a new man	Waxaan dareemay sidii nin cusub
I could not say anything	Waxba waan u sheegi waayay
I want to go tomorrow.	Waxaan rabaa inaan berrito tago.
That's what he does.	Waa waxa uu sameeyo.
That he can do it.	In uu samayn karo.
I think that was where he came from	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd meesha uu ka yimid
I wish they did.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay sameeyaan.
Nothing happened to me.	Waxba igama dhici jirin.
I would love to see you there !.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko halkaas!.
I don't think anyone else is here.	U malayn maayo in qof kale halkan joogo.
It's urgent, he said to himself.	Waa degdeg, ayuu is yidhi.
He was now here.	Hadda wuu joogay halkan.
I thought you knew that	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad taas ogtahay
Maybe I shouldn’t get a chance for that	Malaha waa inaan fursad ii helin taas
I promised not to mention	Waxaan ballan qaaday inaanan sheegin
I did not understand at first	Maan fahmin markii hore
Mostly just me.	Inta badan aniga kaliya.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Me him.	Aniga isaga.
But he went too far.	Laakiin aad ayuu u baxay.
I just want him to be a good person	Waxaan rabaa inuu noqdo qof wanaagsan oo kaliya
I have to.	Waa inaan.
It wasn’t after him at all.	Ma ahayn isaga ka dib oo dhan.
I know he felt it, too	Waan ogahay inuu dareemay, sidoo kale
I would say that is true today	Waxaan odhan lahaa taasi waa run maanta
I did not want her to be there.	Maan rabin in ay halkaas joogto.
I used to see it sometimes.	Mar mar ayaan arki jiray.
He clearly saw what he had to do.	Waxa uu si cad u arkay waxa uu samayn lahaa.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange	Ilaa hadda lama hadlin isaga
I love who you are	Waan jeclahay qofka aad tahay
Very fond of.	Aad u jecel.
I still can't see what it is	Weli ma arki karin waxa ay tahay
I should have known he needed me	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inuu ii baahan yahay
I want to know what happened and why	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay iyo sababta
And good and bad.	Iyo wax wanaagsan iyo wax xun.
I found it there	Waan ka helay halkaas
I still can't stay late	Weli ma sii joogi karo goor dambe
I was not ready for what happened	Diyaar uma ahayn wixii dhacay
It was not a big deal.	Wax dhib badan ma ahayn.
I wanted to talk.	Waxaan rabay inuu hadlo.
Someone other than me.	Qof aan aniga ahayn.
I will not let you do it	U yeeli maayo inay ku sameyso
I couldn't help it.	Waan caawin waayay.
I tried	waan isku dayay
I want to know if they are good or not	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado inay fiican yihiin iyo in kale
Hard people.	Dadka ku adag.
Not so much, not so fast.	Ma aha sidaas u badan, ma si degdeg ah.
I saw an opportunity	Waxaan arkay fursad
I am very happy to go.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan tago.
I know she was happy she was	Waan ogahay inay ku faraxsan tahay inay ahayd
This was done without difficulty.	Taas waxaa la sameeyay dhib la'aan.
I am happy for him.	Waan ku faraxsanahay isaga.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
I was in it	waan ku jiray
There was none.	Ma jirin.
I hope you like this little one.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto kan yar.
Only man.	Nin kaliya.
I can be anything you need.	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
He does well and looks happy.	Si fiican ayuu u sameeyaa oo wuxuu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan.
It can be done.	Waa la samayn karaa.
You are older than me.	Waad iga weyn tahay.
That is what they should do.	Taasi waa inay sameeyaan.
You are a smart person.	Waxaad tahay qof caqli badan.
I have no problem with that	Dhib uma arag taas
I know how to do that	Waan ogahay sida loo sameeyo taas
We need all the people we can get.	Waxaan u baahanahay dhammaan dadka aan heli karno.
She told him everything she needed to know.	Waxay u sheegtay wax kasta oo ay u baahan tahay inay ogaato.
Maybe he is a very good man.	Malaha waa nin aad u fiican.
I want something to do	waxaan rabaa wax aan sameeyo
It's not just you.	Kaliya maaha adiga.
I am very skeptical.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
would	lahaa
I got the job done quickly	Waxaan shaqada ku helay si degdeg ah
I guess you can't talk	Waxaan filayaa inaadan hadli karin
He can come here to help.	Wuu iman karaa halkan si uu u caawiyo.
She looks very happy.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u faraxsan.
But not always.	Laakiin mar walba maaha.
Great surprise.	Yaab weyn.
I know this was difficult	Waan ogahay in tani ay ahayd mid adag
I can't stay here all the time	Ma joogi karo halkan mar walba
The door would hold.	Albaabka ayaa qaban lahaa.
Several others have tried before.	Dhowr kale oo hore isku dayay.
I wanted to see	Waxaan rabay inaan arko
You only need one place.	Waxaad u baahan tahay hal meel oo kaliya.
.	.
I did not want to do anything to you	Wax aan kugu sameeyo ma rabin
People who love you.	Dadka adiga ku jecel.
I told you everything.	Wax walba waan kuu sheegay.
I will stay here again	Mar kale ayaan sii joogi doonaa halkan
I could not speak to anyone	Qofna lama aan hadli karin
He wondered what he was talking about, what he was doing.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa uu ku hadlo, waxa uu sameeyo.
This was done.	Tan ayaa la sameeyay.
I would be willing to work with you	Waxaan diyaar u noqon lahaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
It was never done.	Waligiis lama qaban.
I did not give it again	Mar kale ma siin
I have never been there	Weligay maan joogin halkaas
I can't say enough good enough	Ma sheegi karo wax ku filan oo wanaagsan
Ah I got it back.	Ah dib baan u helay.
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
I will pay.	waan bixin doonaa.
I really wanted to talk about something else	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan wax kale ka hadlo
Here it is.	Waa kan.
That is what they are required to do.	Taasi waa waxa laga rabo inay sameeyaan.
Not much but enough.	Ma aha wax badan laakiin ku filan.
He should not have done so.	Ma ahayn inuu sidaas sameeyo.
I would definitely go back again	Hubaal waan ku noqon lahaa mar kale
What happened.	Maxaa ku dhacay.
You got into this.	Adiga ayaa galay tan.
I guess they don't like me	Waxaan filayaa in aanay i jeclayn
But you know, a little money for me.	Laakiin waad ogtahay, lacag yar oo aniga ah.
Not you	Adiga maaha
This can be very positive.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
I should have expected that	Waxay ahayd inaan taas filan lahaa
I love you the way you are	Waan ku jeclahay sida aad tahay
I do not want to stay here	Ma doonayo inaan halkan sii joogo
Just to see him.	Kaliya inaan arko isaga.
It was not too difficult.	Ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
I need to do it now	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadda sameeyo
I need to know a little bit about it	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax yar ka ogaado
You should not be here.	Waa inaadan halkan joogin.
Interesting idea.	Fikrad xiiso leh.
I really need it.	Runtii waan u baahanahay.
Another beautiful place.	Meel qurux badan oo kale.
Sida.	Sida.
I told him he would be fine	Waxaan u sheegay inuu fiicnaan doono
He wants to talk.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu hadlo.
I love what's new	Waxaan jeclahay waxa ku cusub
Only once.	Hal mar kaliya.
It is not a good time, when there is so much to do.	Ma ahan waqti fiican, marka ay jiraan wax badan oo la sameeyo.
Maybe we can help a little?	Ma laga yaabaa inaan wax yar ku caawin karno?.
I saw it everywhere	Waxaan ku arkay meel walba
I would love to be here with you now.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan kula joogto hadda.
But now, here it was.	Laakiin hadda, halkan waxay ahayd.
It really is so.	Runtii waa sidaas.
I told her it was good	Waxaan u sheegay inay fiican tahay
Tomorrow is another day.	Berrito waa maalin kale.
And there, three more.	Oo halkaas, saddex kale.
Everyone looks the same.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa isku mid.
I will definitely do it again	Hubaal waan samayn doonaa mar kale
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
It is still my favorite.	Waa ilaa hadda aan jeclahay.
I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay.
I think that is a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
Please more, more.	Fadlan wax badan, ka badan.
He wants to do it.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu sameeyo.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
It's a lot of time.	Waa wakhti badan.
Very, very interesting.	Aad iyo aad u xiiso badan.
I have never even seen it.	Weligay xitaa ma arag.
I must.	waa inaan.
He has no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma leh.
I do not want you.	Ma rabo inaad.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
For a while he tried to say something.	In muddo ah ayuu isku dayay inuu wax sheego.
That is not true tonight.	Taasi sax maaha caawa.
Not so great.	Ma aha sidaas u weyn.
Take more time	Waqti badan qaado
I can do it	waan samayn karaa
I'm not sure you will.	Ma hubo inaad yeeli doonto.
It could even be a man.	Xitaa waxay noqon kartaa nin.
I'm really sure of that.	Runtii taas waan hubaa.
Sure, he was a very tall man.	Hubaal, wuxuu ahaa nin aad u dheer.
Here, now.	Halkan, hadda.
That is good to know.	Taasi way wanaagsan tahay in la ogaado.
But now he knew better.	Laakiin hadda si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
It's just that.	Kaliya waa sidaas.
This is a big problem for me.	Tani waa dhibaato badan aniga.
I hope you know that.	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas ogtahay.
I need to go	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago
It may help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawiso.
I know what you did to me.	Waan ogahay waxaad igu samaysay.
I can't do anything	Wax ma samayn karo
Do not tell anyone.	Cidna ha u sheegin.
Everything is fine for me.	Wax walba waa igu fiican yihiin aniga.
This was not the case.	Tani ma ahayn sidii la rabay.
One and the other.	Mid kale iyo mid kale.
Maybe it's here	Malaha waa halkan
I can tell you what it was.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa waxa ay ahayd.
You said it well.	Si fiican ayaad u sheegtay.
They do not.	Ma sameeyaan.
There really is no such thing.	Runtii ma jiro wax kale oo la mid ah.
It doesn't even seem like anyone lives here.	Xitaa uma eka in qof halkan ku nool yahay.
He really has.	Dhab ahaantii wuu leeyahay.
Both are good.	Labaduba way wanaagsan yihiin.
Several of them.	Dhowr ka mid ah.
It's true.	Waa run.
If you love me, you can find me.	Haddii aad i jeceshahay, waad i heli kartaa.
I can't stop.	Kuma joojin karo.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax wanaagsan.
There is no way to find out.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado.
That is what you need to know.	Taasi waa waxa aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
It's the same idea.	Waa isku fikrad.
I couldn't believe it so much.	Aad ayaan u rumaysan waayay.
Obviously not.	Waxa iska cad in aanu jirin.
Good day before !.	Maalin wanaagsan ka hor!.
I have never been like that.	Weligay sidaas maan ahayn.
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqada tago
you were right	sax baad ahayd
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
It could not be.	Ma noqon karin.
.	.
That is what I think, but I am not sure.	Taasi waa waxa aan u malaynayo, laakiin lama hubo.
And he was always the one to find something worthwhile.	Oo wuxuu had iyo jeer ahaa mid ka mid ah inuu helo wax aan waxba ahayn.
That was new.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid cusub.
I have never seen you so good.	Weligay ma arag adiga oo aad u wanaagsan.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe sidaas maaha.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
What did you do?	Maxaad samaysay.
You and I are not the same.	Aniga iyo adiga isku mid baan ahayn.
One is more than nothing.	Mid waa wax ka badan wax aan jirin.
Nothing big, big.	Wax weyn ma jiraan, weyn.
Not three times.	Saddex jeer maaha.
I would do that	waan samayn lahaa taas
It happened three times.	Saddex jeer buu dhacay.
She did not have a busy day.	Ma aysan haysan maalin mashquul badan.
That should not be a problem.	Taasi waa inaysan dhibaato noqon.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
There is very bad luck with this.	Waxaa jira nasiib aad u xun tan.
Tell us what you want.	Noo sheeg waxaad rabto.
No one came.	Cidna kama iman.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
But she was unable to do so.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday inay samayso.
I really wasn't.	dhab maan ahayn.
Definitely more.	Dhab ahaantii in ka badan.
Quick.	Degdeg ah.
Now I know.	Hadda waan garanayaa.
He has a lot to learn.	Wax badan oo uu barto ayuu hayaa.
No one saw anything.	Qofna waxba ma arag.
I think everyone does.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba uu sameeyo.
I will not take it well.	Si fiican uma qaadan doono.
I have no idea what happened to him.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay.
I still love you	wali waan ku jeclahay
This is not very difficult.	Tani ma aha mid aad u adag.
I can’t tell people, either.	Dadka kuma sheegi karo, sidoo kale.
Anything beautiful is a problem.	Wax kasta oo qurux badan waa dhibaato.
This is bigger than us.	Tani way naga weyn tahay.
He really wanted someone.	Qof dhab ah buu rabay.
Not sure what it is now.	Ma hubo waxa ay hadda tahay.
I am very happy now.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay hadda.
He said loudly.	Aad buu u yidhi.
I never got enough.	Weligay ma helin wax ku filan.
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
Now they do not know what is coming.	Hadda ma ay garanayn waxa soo socda.
This was a few years ago.	Tani waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
The best place to stay was at home, alone.	Meesha ugu fiican ee la joogi karo waxay ahayd guriga, keligiis.
We are fast.	Waxaan si degdeg ah.
Something to hold on to	Wax lagu hayo
It's hard work.	Waa shaqo adag.
I did not want a man.	Maan rabin nin.
It doesn't have to be much better.	Ma aha in ay wax badan ka fiican tahay.
Not an idea.	Fikrad maaha.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
Unemployment.	Shaqo la'aan.
It is better than nothing.	Way ka fiican tahay waxba.
That's when he saw it.	Waa markii uu arkay.
Like the door.	Sida albaabka.
But it is a good thing to have.	Laakiin waa wax fiican in la haysto.
After all, there is not much to say.	Tan kale, ma jiraan wax badan oo la sheego.
I left.	Waan ka baxay.
It really was.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd.
It's good, really.	Way fiican tahay, runtii.
Let him speak now.	Hadda ha hadlo.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I think that's right	Waxay ila tahay sax
Not too early.	Ma ahan goor hore.
But also good.	Laakiin sidoo kale wax wanaagsan.
I really didn’t.	Runtii ma aanan samayn.
She realized that it would not take long.	Way ogaatay in aanay wakhti badan qaadan doonin.
It has become too much.	Waxa uu noqday mid aad u badan.
How good.	Sidee u fiican.
He was a tall, handsome man.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dheer, nin wanaagsan.
There is always something else to do.	Mar walba waxaa jira wax kale oo la rabo.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
It is only needed if you are too much.	Waxa kaliya ee loo baahan yahay haddii aad aad u badan tahay.
It is not a beautiful place.	Meel qurux badan maaha.
But close, really.	Laakiin dhow, dhab ahaantii.
Everyone wants to do that.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu taas sameeyo.
I need someone	Waxaan u baahanahay qof
They are not just friends.	Ma aha saaxiibo kaliya.
He tried something else.	Wax kale ayuu isku dayay.
There is no charge.	Ma jiraan wax lacag ah.
One of us now.	Mid naga mid ah hadda.
I can't stop.	Ma joojin karo.
That was.	Taasi waxay ahayd.
It is very difficult to find.	Aad bay u adag tahay in la helo.
He took everything.	Wax walba wuu qaatay.
You knew nothing.	Waxba kama aadan ogayn.
But here is where they get interesting.	Laakiin halkan waa halka ay ka heli xiiso.
In fact, you need me.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaad ii baahan tahay.
No one goes home.	Qofna ma tago guriga.
I am still happy now.	Wali waan ku faraxsanahay hadda.
I could not say for sure, he said.	Si sax ah uma sheegi karin, ayuu yidhi.
But there is so much more to do.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo kale oo la sameeyo.
It is not.	Ma aha.
There is nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la sameeyo ma jiraan.
They will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doonaan.
I would do it again, it was a lot of fun.	Mar kale ayaan samayn lahaa, waxay ahayd wax badan oo xiiso leh.
He knows you love him.	Wuu ogyahay inaad jeceshahay isaga.
Even a little better.	Xitaa xoogaa ka sii fiican.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo.
You know you will not do it.	Waad ogtahay inaadan yeeli doonin.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
I knew it would be.	Waan ogaa inay taasi noqon doonto.
I will go for something else	wax kale ayaan aadi doonaa
It’s a little real.	Waa wax yar oo dhab ah.
Maybe later.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in dambe.
Not everyone is present.	Qof walba ma joogo.
I can't do anything.	Waxba ma samayn karo.
I'm surprised you're here tonight.	Waxaan la yaabay inaad caawa halkan joogto.
He didn't want to see that again.	Ma uusan rabin in uu arko taas mar kale.
I have to tell him.	Waa inaan u sheego.
as one.	sida mid ka mid ah.
But there was no urgency.	Laakiin ma jirin wax degdeg ah.
He wanted it badly.	Si xun buu u rabay.
That can't do anything right now.	Taas hadda waxba kama qaban karto.
More than anyone.	In ka badan qof kasta.
I do not understand why this is.	Ma fahmin sababta tani u tahay.
It is nothing more than you.	Ma aha wax ka badan adiga.
I think he is happy to have you there.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu meesha kaa haysto.
Someone has to do it.	Qof waa inuu sameeyaa.
But don't do it.	Laakiin ha samayn.
It was found.	Waa la helay.
I have three.	Waxaan leeyahay saddex.
Maybe he was.	Malaha wuu ahaa.
He may have left.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ka baxay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
You do not have to do that.	Ma aha inaad taas samayso.
It would be nice if you could do it.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii aad samayn lahayd.
We will do it.	Waanu samayn doonaa.
I can't see	Ma arki karo
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
You know most of what happened here.	Waad ogtahay inta badan waxa halkan ka dhacay.
we would not say anything.	waxba uma sheegi lahayn.
I wanted you to know that.	Waxaan rabay inaad taas ogaato.
I was told.	Waa la ii sheegay.
I did that.	taas ayaan sameeyay.
This was not what he wanted.	Tani ma ahayn wixii uu rabay.
At first, it was very good.	Markii hore, waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
Don't be real.	Ha noqon mid dhab ah.
He is so amazing.	Aad ayuu u yaab badan yahay.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
I know you did.	Waan ogahay inaad samaysay.
They will love it.	Way jeclaan doonaan.
For me this is correct.	Aniga ahaan tani waa sax.
Nothing needs to be done.	Ma aha in wax la sameeyo.
I did this several times, and no one helped.	Dhowr jeer ayaan tan sameeyay, qofna ma caawin.
She had to help.	Waxay ahayd inuu caawiyo.
There was something he did not come out of.	Waxaa jiray wax uusan ka soo bixin.
So it has already been put in a false place.	Sidaas ayaa mar hore loo dhigay meel been ah.
The same can be said for me.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa la ii sheegi karaa.
This was not correct.	Tani sax ma ahayn.
For a long time.	Muddo dheer.
She told him to leave.	Waxay u sheegtay inuu baxo.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
He did not come close.	Uma soo dhawaan.
I knew she would do that.	Waan ogaa inay taasi samayn doonto.
Nothing is missing.	Wax meesha ka baxay ma jiraan.
I have to go home	Waa inaan aado guriga
There is no right.	Ma jirto si sax ah.
That may be true.	Taasi run bay noqon kartaa.
I will give you another.	Mid kale ayaan ku siin doonaa.
The only thing that is clear.	Waxa kaliya ee cad.
There is so much good to be said.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo wanaagsan in laga sheego.
This is a great place to be.	Tani waa meel fiican oo la joogo.
Everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
It was work.	Waxay ahayd shaqada.
What a man.	Waa maxay nin.
I can't say enough.	Wax ku filan ma odhan karo.
But she should not have known that.	Laakiin ma ay ahayn inay taas ogaato.
They do it every day.	Waxay sameeyaan maalin kasta.
He liked that.	Taas wuu ka helay.
You know, it's hard for people here.	Waad ogtahay, way ku adag tahay dadka halkan.
As we do.	Sida aan samayno.
It is obvious.	Waa wax iska cad.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
This is not what you want.	Tani ma aha waxa aad rabto.
He has to be there.	Waa inuu halkaas joogo.
All that came back.	Dhammaan wixii ku soo noqday.
She did.	Way samaysay.
I have no other job.	Shaqo kale ma hayo.
It is still bad.	Weli way xun tahay.
The rest will come.	Inta kale way iman doontaa.
So they parted company.	Sidaas ayaa lagu kala tagay.
I knew it could not be so.	Waan ogaa inaysan sidaas noqon karin.
I have been here a lot	Wax badan ayaan halkan joogay
I still do not understand how this can happen.	Wali ma fahmin sida ay tani u dhici karto.
I am happy.	Waxaan ku faraxsanahay.
Every day and every day.	Maalin kasta iyo maalin kasta.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
But he did not succeed.	Laakiin kuma guulaysan.
I was the only person in the room.	Waxaan ahaa qofka kaliya ee qolka ku jiray.
They have to be smart.	Waa inay caqli badan yihiin.
It can not happen.	Ma dhici karto.
What to do.	Maxaa la sameeyaa.
Take what you need from me.	Iga qaado waxaad u baahan tahay.
Maybe he wants another one now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hadda doonayo mid kale.
You are too little to know.	Aad baad u yar tahay inaad ogaato.
Not the best.	Ma aha kan ugu fiican.
Every man was a friend.	Nin walba saaxiib buu ahaa.
Adam did not.	Aadan ma lahayn.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
That's what he would do.	Waa wixii uu samayn lahaa.
I do not think so.	U malayn maayo.
There was still a lot to learn.	Weli wax badan ayaa jiray in la barto.
Another day, another problem.	Maalin kale, dhibaato kale.
And something to eat.	Iyo wax la cuno.
Let me know.	Aan ogaado.
It wasn’t too bad there.	Ma ahayn mid aad u xun halkaas.
you were real.	dhab baad ahayd.
More to do, less time.	Wax badan oo la sameeyo, waqti aad u yar.
He has very little.	Waxa uu leeyahay wax aad u yar.
What it was, it was.	Maxay ahayd, waxay ahayd.
Who is it? 	Waa kuma?
I guess you can't get money from other people.	Waxaan filayaa inaadan lacag ka heli karin dadka kale.
I just am.	Kaliya waan ahay.
He knew there was a problem.	Wuu ogaa inay dhibaato jirto.
I wanted to	waxaan rabay
It did not come out	Ma soo bixin
She did not want to.	Ma ay rabin.
She did not want to do that.	Ma ay rabin in ay samayso taas.
Not very good	Aad uma fiican
Small, but nice.	Yar, laakiin fiican.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
A friend of a friend.	Saaxiib saaxiib.
All well and good.	Dhammaan si fiican oo fiican.
I wonder what else is in place.	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa kale oo meesha ku jira.
Everyone knew that.	Qof walba waa iga ogaa taas.
No problem	Dhib ma rabo
I gave everything.	Wax walba waan siiyay.
I really don't even want to talk about it.	Runtii xitaa ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
There is nothing to talk about.	Wax laga hadlo ma jiraan.
He may not have said it correctly.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan si sax ah u sheegin.
Maybe even it was true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa inay run ahayd.
I found	waan helay
And to speak, clearly.	Iyo in la hadlo, si cad.
It looks very interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma hayo.
Maybe someone got it early.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof helay waqti hore.
It would do very well.	Waxay sameyn lahayd si aad u wanaagsan.
I felt it.	Waan dareemay.
It is done in the same way.	Waxaa loo sameeyaa sidaas oo kale.
I was really serious.	Runtii dhab baan ahaa.
I thought it was really good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay runtii aad u fiican tahay.
I have to do more.	Waa inaan wax badan sameeyaa.
But he does it with you.	Laakiin adiga ayuu kula sameeyaa.
Just what he needs.	Kaliya waxa uu u baahan yahay.
I went back.	Dib baan uga noqday.
This, so far, is probably my favorite.	Tani, ilaa hadda, waxay u badan tahay inay tahay kan aan jeclahay.
I will get better as new after a while.	Waxaan ku fiicnaan doonaa sida cusub waqti yar ka dib.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
He never wanted to.	Waligiis ma rabin.
I could not see clearly.	Si cad ayaan u arki waayay.
I would say.	Ka sheegi lahaa.
you are amazing.	yaab baad tahay.
More.	Wax ka badan.
But it may do more.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax badan qaban karto.
I'm just happy here.	Waxa kaliya oo aan ku faraxsanahay halkan.
She had.	Waxay lahayd.
He knew I was going to break up.	Wuu ogaa inaan kala tagi doono.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I will not take him.	Ma qaadan doono isaga.
He returned there.	Halkaas ayuu ku soo noqday.
It will be.	Waxay noqon doontaa.
It will take everyone.	Waxay qaadan doontaa qof walba.
Everything you need to know.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
That, too, was as he wanted it to be.	Taasi, sidoo kale, waxay ahayd sidii uu rabay.
He was tall and handsome and beautiful.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dheer oo qurux badan oo qurux badan .
Not me.	Aniga maaha.
And someone did.	Oo qof baa sameeyay.
Although it is now nothing.	In kasta oo aanay hadda waxba ahayn.
Now he can do little.	Hadda wax yar ayuu samayn karaa.
I am very happy to be here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
I will be arrested.	Waa la igu qaban doonaa.
You are just the best.	Waxaad tahay kaliya kan ugu fiican.
If it’s not money, it’s something else.	Haddii aysan lacag ahayn, waa wax kale.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
They are good friends.	Waa saaxiibo wanaagsan.
What's closest.	Maxaa ugu dhow.
I really don't understand.	Runtii ma fahmin.
You can believe me	Waad i rumaysan kartaa
Boston is unlucky.	Boston nasiib ma leh.
You will find someone.	Waxaad heli doontaa qof.
tell me this is not true.	ii sheeg taasi run maaha.
They need you.	Way kuu baahan yihiin.
He was great.	Wuxuu ahaa mid weyn.
He can say nothing, but that is not the case.	Waxba wuu ku odhan karaa, laakiin taasi ma aha.
Just too bad.	Kaliya aad u xun.
That was a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
I would love that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa taas.
But she didn't pay much.	Laakiin aad uma ay bixin.
It will be very bad.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
Which you will do.	Taas oo aad samayn doonto.
That no longer exists here.	Taasi ma sii jirto halkan.
I still haven't really got it.	Wali ma helin runtii.
Wow, do you think ?.	Yaab, ma u malaynaysaa?.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
New.	Ku cusub.
I just don’t see it that way.	Kaliya sidaas uma arko.
I made him come.	Waan ka dhigay inuu yimaado.
No one knows who she is.	Qofna ma garanayo cidda ay tahay.
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
He never won.	Waligiis ma guulaysan.
I can't take anything now.	Hadda waxba ma qaadan karo.
Only me and you.	Kaliya aniga iyo adiga.
I don't know if this is true or not.	Ma garanayo in tani run tahay iyo in kale.
It would be all.	Waxay ahaan lahayd dhammaan.
All the same.	Dhammaan isku mid.
I can do that now	Taas hadda waan samayn karaa
He is smarter than people.	Dadka wuu ka caqli badan yahay.
Another can be found.	Mid kale wuu heli karaa.
Clearly, she did.	Si cad, way samaysay.
No one can help.	Qofna ma caawin karo.
But I will be better.	Laakiin waan ka fiicnaan doonaa.
Maybe I don't know today.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan maanta garanayn.
Tell me what you told me, 'he said.	U sheeg waxaad ii sheegtay,' ayuu yidhi.
I wanted to be part of this.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo kan.
This will not do.	Tani ma yeeli doono.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
That is how things are.	Taasi waa sida wax u jiraan.
Do nothing.	Waxba ha samayn.
This was not a big deal.	Tani wax weyn ma ahayn.
She probably did.	Waxay u badan tahay inay samaysay.
It cannot end here.	Halkan kuma dhammaan karto.
But he did not say, yet.	Laakiin ma uusan sheegin, weli.
I started working on making one.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan ka shaqeeyo samaynta mid.
I know she wants me to have this.	Waan ogahay inay rabto inaan tan haysto.
That's it.	Waa tan.
I should not have had him here.	Ma ahayn inaan isaga halkan ku haysto.
He knew he was already in one of them.	Wuxuu ogaa inuu hore ugu jiray mid ka mid ah.
There is nothing else she can do.	Wax kale oo ay samayn kartaa ma jirto.
It’s like making time.	Waxay la mid tahay inay waqti samaynayso.
It can be a problem.	Waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
He has it now.	Hadda wuu hayaa.
More, it is needed.	In ka badan, waa loo baahan yahay.
To take something from him.	Inuu wax ka qaado.
I was told it was not a problem.	Waxa la ii sheegay in aanay dhibaato ahayn.
Everyone did.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyay.
I can't say what's going on.	Ma sheegi karo waxa socda.
I can speak now	Hadda waan hadli karaa
Much the same.	Wax badan oo la mid ah.
I knew what would happen.	Waan ogaa waxa dhici doona.
I have been through this a lot.	In badan ayaan tan ku dhacay.
Something big but it looks small.	Wax aad u weyn laakiin waxay u egtahay mid yar.
That is obvious.	Taasi waa wax iska cad.
But he was not ready to know that yet.	Laakiin diyaar uma ay ahayn in uu taas ogaado weli.
That is no small feat.	Taasi wax yar ma aha.
Not someone else.	Ma aha qof kale.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
It is best to do it in person.	Waxaa fiican in qof ahaan loo sameeyo.
All for nothing.	Dhammaan waxba.
They have to do it right.	Waa inay si sax ah u sameeyaan.
I am with someone.	qof baan la joogaa.
He can stop at any time.	Wakhti kasta oo uu doono wuu joojin karaa.
She will still be there for a few years.	Weli waxay halkaas joogi doontaa dhowr sano.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
He can not do it.	Ma uu samayn karo.
I do it well	si fiican ayaan u sameeyaa
I will talk	waan hadli doonaa
it is a lie.	waa been.
In fact, it can help.	Dhab ahaantii, way ku caawin kartaa.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.	In yar oo tan ka mid ah, in yar oo taas ka mid ah.
But it would definitely help.	Laakiin hubaal way ku caawin lahayd.
There was a lot here.	Wax badan ayaa jiray halkan.
I would like to go again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale tago
Apparently he was.	Waxaa cad in uu ahaa.
What he would say he did not know.	Waxa uu odhan doono ma uu garanayn.
You do not need to do anything else.	Uma baahnid inaad wax kale samayso.
Anything happy	Wax kasta oo ku faraxsan
I did not see.	Maan arag.
You are.	Waxaad tahay.
I don't want that.	Ma rabo taas.
This, too, was new.	Tani, sidoo kale, waxay ahayd mid cusub.
I really did not know what, but more.	Runtii ma garanayn waxa, laakiin wax ka badan.
I am very happy to tell you this.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan tan kuu sheego.
But I can not do it.	Laakiin ma samayn karo.
I will not return.	Soo noqon maayo.
I am just like you.	Waxaan la mid ahay adiga oo kale.
I think this was the reason.	Waxaan filayaa inay tani ahayd sababta.
I have to go home	Waa inaan aado guriga
Probably very close.	Aad u dhow malaha.
It was really fun.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I looked curious.	Waxaan eegay xiiso.
In fact, it is the same.	Dhab ahaantii, waa isku mid.
He is a man.	Waa nin.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma iga caawin karaa.
I'm sure it does.	Waan hubaa inuu jiro.
I thought that was weird.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay tahay yaab.
It will be seen.	Waa la arki doonaa.
Is that what you are doing.	Ma waxa aad samaynayso.
One said they could do nothing about it.	Mid ka mid ah ayaa sheegay in aanay waxba ka qaban karin.
He came in to help.	Wuxuu u soo galay inuu caawiyo.
You would do well.	Waxaad samayn lahayd mid wanaagsan.
I was there	waan soo joogay
It would be beautiful.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid qurux badan.
Same as the other.	La mid ah kan kale.
I think that is the only thing I need right now.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ay tahay waxa kaliya ee aan hadda u baahanahay.
We would not go anywhere else.	Meel kale ma aadi lahayn.
This is what you really mean to me.	Tani waa waxa aad runtii aniga ila tahay.
There was nothing else he could do.	Wax kale oo uu samayn lahaa ma jirin.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
But something is better than nothing.	Laakiin wax ayaa ka fiican waxba.
I applied for the job early today.	Waxaan shaqada ka codsaday goor hore maanta.
Day and that.	Maalin iyo taas.
She was a smart person.	Waxay ahayd qof caqli badan.
No one was present.	Qofna lama joogin.
One of us.	Mid naga mid ah.
She did it for me.	Way igu samaysay.
It's a lot.	Waa wax badan.
This was so much more.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
They will cook for you.	Way kuu karin doonaan.
Not so, obviously.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale, iska cad.
Hard work, too.	Shaqo adag, sidoo kale.
He just knew he needed it.	Kaliya wuu ogaa inuu u baahan yahay.
Just to see what happened	Kaliya si aan u arko waxa dhacay
They are in school.	Waxay ku jiraan dugsiga.
Quickly	Si degdeg ah
Much came later.	Wax badan ayaa ka dib yimid.
I did not come.	Ma iman.
Probably that.	Waxay u badan tahay in.
It would not happen at home.	Ma dhici lahayd guriga.
Everyone was talking about you.	Qof kastaa wuu kaa hadli jiray.
It was found as solid and clear.	Waxaa loo helay sida adag oo cad.
As he always has been.	Sida uu had iyo jeer ahaa.
I don't think that will be the case.	U malayn maayo inay taasi ahaan doonto.
If you can't see it alone, very bad.	Haddii aadan keligaa arki karin, aad u xun.
He did not want me to go.	Ma uu rabin inaan tago.
No one will stop you.	Qofna kuma joojin doono.
It's too early.	Waa hore.
I had to get a chance.	Waxay ahayd inaan fursad u helo.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
Just like you.	Sida adiga kaliya.
I will keep him here.	isaga ayaan halkan ku haysan doonaa.
They should.	Waa inay.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
I tried to leave	Waxaan isku dayay inaan baxo
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
Today will be a busy day.	Maanta waxay noqon doontaa maalin mashquul ah.
He had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah kama uu haysan.
You would not pay for this.	Ma aad bixin lahayd tan.
She told him she was happy he was happy.	Waxay u sheegtay inay ku faraxsan tahay inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
He refused to leave.	Wuu diiday inuu baxo.
Not up to anything.	Ma ilaa wax.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I know it's me.	Waan ogahay inay aniga tahay.
I know you are not.	Waan ogahay inaadan ahayn.
It had to be said first.	Waxay ahayd in marka hore la sheego.
I couldn't see anything.	Wax ma arki karin.
But, there is no luck in that.	Laakiin, nasiib ma leh taas.
Enough	Ku filan
He was very smart.	Caqli cad buu ahaa.
A little faster.	In yar oo degdeg ah.
I have to do better.	Waa inaan si ka sii fiican sameeyaa.
It can't do any harm.	Wax dhibaato ah ma samayn karto.
Yes and no.	Waa iyo ma aha.
I will come to you again.	Mar kale ayaan kuu iman doonaa.
This will end.	Tani way dhammaan doontaa.
I looked	Waan eegay
she was ready.	diyaar bay ahayd.
He was destitute.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aan waxba haysan.
I could not leave immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayaan uga bixi waayay.
I would let him.	Waan u ogolaan lahaa isaga.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
I tried the big house.	Waxaan isku dayay guriga weyn.
But for the most part it was not a problem.	Laakiin inta badan dhib ma ahayn.
There was no work.	Wax shaqo ah ma jirin.
I am the same.	Waxaan ahay isku si.
That is why you are here.	Taasi waa sababta aad halkan u joogto.
This is interesting.	Tani waa mid xiiso leh.
He would love to know.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu ogaado.
A lot is better than me.	In badan ayaa iga wanaagsan.
There is no way to do it.	Ma jirto si loo sameeyo.
What can you tell me?	maxaad ii sheegi kartaa?.
But he was.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa.
That is the only place it would happen.	Taasi waa meesha kaliya ee ay ka dhici lahayd.
I am not present	ma joogo
I want to talk about it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo.
He is my favorite	Waa kan ugu jecel
I tried and tried	waan isku dayay oo isku dayay
Whatever it will be, it will be.	Wax kasta oo noqon doona, waxay noqon doontaa.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
I really know how it is.	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa sida ay taasi tahay.
For a few years, really.	Ilaa dhowr sano, dhab ahaantii.
She has a lot of friends.	Waxay leedahay saaxiibo aad u badan.
I was very good at it.	Aad ayaan ugu fiicnaan jiray.
You will come back to it	Dib ayaad ugu soo noqon doontaa
We really can’t stop it.	Runtii kuma joojin karno.
They didn't have to.	Ma ahayn in ay sameeyaan.
The rest did not.	Inta kale ma samayn.
That's a bit of money.	Taasi waa xoogaa lacag ah.
Posted here.	Ayaa halkan dhigay.
But that was not the reason.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn sababta.
I love everyone happy.	Waxaan jeclahay qof kasta oo faraxsan.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
But even.	Laakiin xitaa.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
He did not come.	Uma uu iman.
There is nothing good for people.	Ma jiraan wax dadka u wanaagsan.
But he is bigger.	Laakiin wuu ka weyn yahay.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
I can't think why.	Ma malayn karo sababta.
I would like one.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa mid.
He really loves you.	Runtii wuu ku jecel yahay.
Maybe he knows where we can talk.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ogaado meel aan ka hadli karno.
She is very happy.	Aad bay ugu faraxsan tahay.
he would take.	wuu qaadan lahaa.
He knew very well.	Aad buu u ogaa.
He has not yet had a chance to eat.	Weli ma uu helin fursad uu wax ku cuno.
I will definitely win.	Hubaal waan guulaysan doonaa.
They don’t contain anything, either.	Waxba kuma jiraan, sidoo kale.
And for a while, that was a problem.	Iyo in muddo ah, taasi waxay ahayd dhibaato.
Nothing can be done about it.	Wax laga qaban karaa ma jirto.
Now here's why.	Hadda waa kan sababta.
Only, this is not.	Kaliya, tani maaha.
That has been good, so far.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan, ilaa hadda.
I was surprised by that.	Taas ayaan la yaabay.
No one will be harmed.	Qofna wax yeeli maayo.
But not much.	Laakiin ma badna.
I am very happy to see this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan arko tan.
I love him.	Waan jeclahay isaga.
No one told what happened.	Qofna uma sheegin waxa dhacay.
Can you find him.	Ma u heli kartaa isaga.
Best of all, even.	Tan ugu fiican, xitaa.
It was put in a solid place.	Waxa la dhigay meel adag.
I tried and tried and I tried nothing busy.	Waxaan isku dayay oo isku dayay oo aan isku dayay waxba mashquul ah.
He has a problem.	Dhibaato ayuu qabaa.
But three were right.	Laakiin saddex ayaa sax ahaa.
I'm glad she did well.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay si fiican u samaysay.
I know he did.	Waan ogahay inuu sameeyay.
Only.	Kaliya.
Now here is the problem	Hadda halkan waa dhib
He has and.	Waxa uu leeyahay iyo.
That is the same as before.	Taasi waa sidii hore.
You can do what you like.	Waxaad ku samayn kartaa waxaad jeceshahay.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
But we will win for sure.	Laakiin waanu ku guulaysan doonaa hubaal.
I do not believe.	Maan rumaysan.
I just can't go out.	Ma bixi karo oo kaliya.
I’m sure it was great.	Waxaan hubaa inay ahayd wax weyn.
This is often non-existent.	Tani inta badan waa wax aan jirin.
I want you to be with me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ila joogto.
Same but not the same.	Isku mid laakiin maaha isku mid.
I don't know where he came from.	Ma garanayo meel uu ka yimid.
That is the next big thing.	Taasi waa waxa weyn ee soo socda.
They are hard and small.	Way adag yihiin oo yar yihiin.
I did	waan sameeyay
But there are many unknowns.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo aan la garanayn.
This was complicated.	Tani waxay ahayd mid dhib badan.
But it was not home.	Laakiin guriga ma ahayn.
That is what it is not.	Taasi waa waxa aanay ahayn.
You are who you are.	Waxaad tahay qofka aad tahay.
They are happy.	Way faraxsan yihiin.
I am not a bad man.	Nin xun ma ihi.
What to do, what to do.	Maxaa la sameeyaa, maxaa la sameeyaa.
What you can't do is tell them what to do.	Waxa aadan samayn karin waa u sheeg waxa la sameeyo.
That is not what you have.	Taasi maaha waxa aad leedahay.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
He was not there to leave.	Ma jirin si uu uga baxo.
To help me.	Si aad ii caawiso.
This cannot be done.	Tani ma samayn karto.
Everything I need.	Wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay.
I went to work, really.	Waxaan aaday shaqada, runtii.
And really, really hard.	Iyo dhab ahaantii, aad u adag.
Do not speak too fast.	Si degdeg ah ha u hadlin.
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
He returned shortly afterwards.	Wax yar ka dib wuu soo noqday.
Really interesting too.	Runtii aad u xiiso badan sidoo kale.
Both are bad.	Labaduba waa xun yihiin.
Now that you say it, not for a while.	Hadda oo aad sheegto, ma aha in muddo ah.
There was no problem with him.	Wax dhib ah kuma lahayn isaga.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I am here now	hadda waan joogaa
But he may have it.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuu haysto.
You can not say that.	Taas kama sheegi kartid.
Still, good to know.	Weli, fiican in la ogaado.
It must be done immediately.	Waa in la sameeyaa waqti degdeg ah.
I will not talk about that today.	Taas ka hadli maayo maanta.
It was a beautiful surprise.	Waxay ahayd yaab qurux badan.
But no one spoke.	Laakiin qofna ma hadlin.
She told me how sorry she was.	Waxay ii sheegtay sida ay uga xun tahay.
I want to see more of you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko wax badan.
That would be another.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid kale.
Anyone but me.	Qof kasta oo aan aniga ahayn.
Probably not.	Malaha ma dhici doonto.
He does not want to come out.	Ma rabo inuu soo baxo.
It will take a very long time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u dheer.
Everything you need.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
How to get this.	Sida loo helo tan.
Other than that, there is nothing else to really say.	Wax kale oo aan ahayn, ma jiraan wax kale oo runtii wax laga sheego.
It is too early now.	Hadda waa goor hore.
is good for you.	wuu kuu fiican yahay.
I'm sure this will work well.	Waxaan hubaa in tani ay si fiican u fiicnaan doonto.
But it will still not be very interesting.	Laakiin weli ma noqon doonto mid aad u xiiso badan.
I don't think you are any different from him.	Uma maleynayo inaad si kale ula mid tahay isaga.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
Maybe he couldn't talk to you.	Malaha wuu kula hadli waayay.
great, there.	weyn, halkaas.
Only he left.	Kaliya isaga ayaa ka tagay.
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
Not much to say.	Ma aha wax badan in laga sheego.
That's right everyone.	Waa sax qof walba.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
It really didn't matter.	Runtii dhib ma lahayn.
True to everyone.	Run inta badan qof walba.
I may have dropped out of school.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan dugsiga ka tagay.
It really wasn’t too bad.	Dhab ahaantii ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
He had nothing to say.	Wax uu sheego ma uu haysan.
I have never seen anyone so late.	Weligay ma arag qof sidaas dib u dhigay.
You did everything.	Wax walba waad samaysay.
Not big, but really small.	Ma aha wax weyn, laakiin dhab ahaantii wax yar.
It should not be needed.	Waa inaan loo baahnayn.
They will come.	Way iman doonaan.
It looks like the latter.	Waxay u egtahay tan dambe.
You are good at it.	Waad ku fiican tahay.
No wonder really.	La yaab ma leh runtii.
They will not come.	Ma iman doonaan.
I knew this.	Waan ogaa tan.
If he ever did.	Haddii uu waligiis sameeyay.
Until he returned no one had seen him.	Ilaa uu soo noqday qofna ma arag.
You can go to school if you want.	Waxaad aadi kartaa dugsiga haddii aad rabto.
Now you are.	Hadda waxaad tahay.
This brought up.	Tani waxay soo qaaday.
I spent a lot of time on it.	Waqti badan ayaan ku qaatay.
Really a bad idea.	Runtii fikrad xun.
All the while.	Inta oo dhan.
I thought it would be interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay noqon doonto mid xiiso leh.
I really can't do anything about it.	Runtii waxba kuma samayn karo.
There was still time to do something.	Weli waxaa jiray waqti wax lagu sameeyo.
What is it.	Waa maxay.
I should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si fiican u ogaado.
This is a real surprise.	Tani waa yaab dhab ah.
You can't be real.	Ma noqon kartid dhab.
You can always tell someone else.	Had iyo jeer waxaad u sheegi kartaa qof kale.
Both are still here.	Labaduba waa weli halkan.
I have nothing else to say.	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan sheego.
He looked so good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u fiican.
He has something you will love.	Waxa uu leeyahay wax aad jeclaan doonto.
I can do a lot with that.	Wax badan ayaan taas ku qaban karaa.
It’s not something I like.	Ma aha wax aan jeclahay.
I wondered what had happened.	Waxaan la yaabay maxaa dhacay.
She loves you.	Way ku jeceshahay.
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
I have never seen anything like it.	Waligiis ma arag wax la mid ah.
Maybe I should say more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax badan sheego.
And ready to talk.	Oo diyaar u ah inuu la hadlo.
I will be	waan ahaan doonaa
I would help you	waan ku caawin lahaa
I thought it was the best thing he had.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay waxa ugu wanaagsan ee uu haysto.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
This can be reported.	Tani waa la soo sheegi karaa.
Who is willing to do anything and everyone.	Yaa diyaar u ah inuu sameeyo wax kasta iyo qof kasta.
For all he knew, that was true.	Wixii uu ogaa oo dhan, taasi run bay ahayd.
Something happened to you.	Wax baa kugu dhacay.
There was none.	Ma jirin.
I found a place for everyone but you.	Waxaan meel u helay qof walba oo aan adiga ahayn.
It can take time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
I didn't like it much.	Wax badan maan jeclayn.
It was the only thing she could do.	Waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee ay samayn karto.
It looks great and very nice.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn oo aad u fiican.
Let me tell you what is amazing.	Aan kuu sheego waxa la yaab leh.
As he can.	Sida uu awoodo.
I wonder why this is.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta tani u tahay.
It was unprecedented.	Waxay ahayd mid aanu hore u arag.
It's just amazing.	Kaliya waa wax la yaab leh.
How good that would be.	Sidee u fiicnaan lahayd taasi.
Tell me now.	Hadda ii sheeg.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
I don't want to help him.	Ma doonayo inaan caawiyo isaga.
I decided that.	Taas ayaan go’aansaday.
The best place he could go, really.	Meesha ugu fiican ee uu aadi karo, runtii.
You must.	Waa inaad.
But all good.	Laakiin dhan wanaagsan.
I can go against it	Waan ka hor iman karaa
Everyone is still living together.	Qof kastaa weli wuu wada nool yahay.
I have an early day tomorrow.	Waxaan leeyahay maalin hore berrito.
I know that is hard.	Waan ogahay inay taasi adag tahay.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
But you started it.	Laakiin adiga ayaa bilaabay.
It would be so.	Waxay ahaan lahayd sidaas.
And there is more.	Oo wax badan ayaa jira.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer.
You can even do another one.	Xitaa waxaad samayn kartaa mid kale.
But you can not say.	Laakiin ma sheegi kartid.
He had nowhere to go.	Meel uu aado ma uu haysan.
Don't say that again.	Mar dambe sidaas ha u hadlin.
It had to be taken.	Waxay ahayd in la qaado.
They love it so much.	Aad bay u jecel yihiin.
I would not leave.	Ma bixi lahayn.
Before that, really.	Taas ka hor, dhab ahaantii.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
Not sure what to do.	Ma hubo waxa la sameeyo.
This is really something.	Tani runtii waa wax.
So it is.	Sidaas oo ay tahay.
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
There was not much she could say to him.	Ma jirin wax badan oo ay isaga ku odhan karto.
I hope tomorrow will be a little better.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in berri ay xoogaa ka fiicnaan doonto.
Everyone must have heard.	Qof walba waa inuu maqlay.
I was lucky.	Nasiib ayaan lahaa.
I really want to work with him now.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan la shaqeeyo hadda.
Not very good	Aad uma fiican
I really like it.	Runtii waan jeclahay.
I know what.	Waan ogahay waxa.
This is to be expected.	Tani waa la filayaa.
Soon he would be home.	Wax yar ka dib wuxuu noqon lahaa guriga.
It was not what he wanted.	Ma ahayn waxa uu rabay.
I keep it here.	halkaan ayaan ku hayaa.
But no one knows.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo.
It can't be anything else.	Wax kale ma noqon karto.
But that is not much.	Laakiin taasi wax badan maaha.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
I would like to learn more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan barto
No one knows how.	Qofna ma garanayo sida.
But only once.	Laakiin hal mar kaliya.
For you, this is just another day.	Adiga, tani waa maalin kale oo kaliya.
I hope for food, but who knows what else.	Waxaan rajeynayaa cunto, laakiin yaa yaqaan waxa kale.
I am serious.	dhab baan ahay.
Give once.	Bixi hal mar.
I don't think anything else.	Wax kale uma malaynayo.
It will be amazing.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid la yaab leh.
And not much time.	Oo ma jiro waqti badan.
I can't stop him here.	Halkan waxba kama joojin karo isaga.
But that was not bad enough.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn mid xun oo ku filan.
But now I like it.	Laakiin hadda waan ka helay.
I do not understand you.	kuma fahmin.
Ah! 	Ah!
is here.	waa ku kan.
I wanted to be him.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo isaga.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kama hayo.
That should be seen once.	Taasi waa in la arko hal mar.
If you do it will give you trouble.	Haddii aad sameyso waxay ku siin doontaa dhibaato.
I have nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo aan sameeyo ma hayo.
I like it	waan ka helay
Now.	Hadda.
This is what it is.	Tani waa waxa uu yahay.
It is probably interesting.	Waxay u badan tahay inay xiiso leedahay.
Everything is included.	Wax walba waa ku jiraan.
I've seen it before, but I don't understand it.	Tan iyo markii hore waan arki jiray, laakiin ma aanan fahmin.
More than that.	In ka badan wax badan.
This is difficult.	Tani way adag tahay.
I want to see it now	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadda arko
I will not go.	Ma tagi doono.
But I did not need it.	Laakiin uma baahnayn.
Not surprisingly.	Ma ahan wax la yaab leh.
All at once.	Dhammaan hal mar.
But that was something.	Laakiin taasi wax bay ahayd.
Money, money, money.	Lacag, lacag, lacag.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
He will never do it.	Waligiis ma yeeli doono.
It was also what made him so good.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd waxa ka dhigay inuu aad u fiican yahay.
I really had one.	Runtii waxaan lahaa mid.
I do not want to get it.	Ma doonayo inaan helo.
This is what I want.	Tani waa waxa aan rabo.
He could not do otherwise.	Si kale ma uu yeeli karin.
He knew what he needed.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu u baahan yahay.
I could not do it for him.	Ma aan yeeli karin isaga.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
But it was found.	Laakiin waa la helay.
It is all true.	Dhammaan waa run.
What an emergency.	Maxaa degdeg ah.
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
The reason was not stated.	Sababta lama sheegin.
It's too early.	Waa hore.
It was not right.	Sax ma ahayn.
What do you think you should do.	Waxa ay kula tahay in aad samayso.
He knew very well.	Aad buu u ogaa.
I didn't like anyone very much.	Qofna aad uma jeclayn.
I liked that.	Taas ayaan uga helay.
You will need the rest.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inta kale.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
In fact, it had nothing to do with it here.	Run ahaantii, halkan shaqo kuma lahayn.
This only needs to be done once.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay kaliya in la sameeyo hal mar.
I want to say something else.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sheego wax kale.
I can't help it	kuma caawin karo
I may not be able to help you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan awoodin in aan ku caawiyo.
This is a problem.	Tani waa dhibaato.
I decided.	Aniga ayaa go'aansaday.
It's more complicated than that.	Way ka dhib badan tahay taas.
He saw himself.	Wuu is arkay.
Go to work.	Aad shaqada.
I still can't believe anyone is doing that.	Wali ma rumaysan karo in qof uu sidaas samaynayo.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
He may have already been here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hore u joogay halkan.
Maybe it was luck.	Malaha waxay ahayd nasiib.
This will be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
That is enough for me.	Taasi waa igu filan tahay aniga.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
This was smart.	Tani waxay ahayd mid caqli badan.
If they.	Haddii ay.
This is great.	Tani way weyn tahay.
He makes and makes good money.	Wuxuu sameeyaa oo uu sameeyaa lacag fiican.
Once upon a time, maybe.	Hal mar, malaha.
I was busy	Mashquul baan galay
They just exist.	Kaliya waa ay jiraan.
There is another.	Mid kale ayaa jira.
I really need it.	Runtii waan u baahanahay.
That's what they like.	Taasi waa waxa ay jecel yihiin.
I have something	wax baan leeyahay
I didn't find anything.	Waxba maan helin.
Only one problem.	Hal dhibaato oo kaliya.
Maybe this too.	Malaha tani sidoo kale.
For almost three years.	Muddo ku dhow saddex sano.
He and I are friends.	Aniga iyo isaga ayaan saaxiibo nahay.
But I can't find it.	Laakiin ma awoodo inaan helo.
It never comes out again.	Mar dambe dib uma soo baxo.
I don't think she has.	Uma maleynayo inay leedahay.
Long food.	Cunto dheer.
Maybe he is right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sax yahay.
People like us.	Dadka nala mid ah.
For me, he became a lesser person.	Aniga, waxa uu noqday qof ka yar.
I had to talk to her.	Waxay ahayd inaan la hadlo.
You can stretch	Waad kala bixin kartaa
But that was not all.	Laakiin wax walba ma ahayn.
Everyone knows the former.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay kan hore.
He did so several times.	Waxa uu sidaas sameeyay dhowr jeer.
I once did this.	Mar ayaan tan sameeyay.
What happened to you, he seems to have.	Maxaa kaa galay, wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu leeyahay.
It’s everyone.	Waa qof kasta.
I do a lot.	Wax badan ayaan sameeyaa.
Maybe you were, if you were me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ahaan lahayd, haddii aad aniga ahaan lahayd.
But 'this' was bad.	Laakiin 'tani' waxay ahayd mid xun.
That should be done most of the time.	Taasi waa inay sameeyaan inta badan.
Same as before.	Isla sidii hore.
That will happen to you.	Taasi way kugu dhici doontaa.
This was awful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Maybe.	Malaha.
More is coming.	Wax badan ayaa soo socda.
More to come	Wax badan oo soo socda
I just can't agree.	Kaliya ma ogolaan karo.
Not true.	Run maaha.
I had to get a job.	Waxay ahayd in aan shaqo helo.
Not sure now.	Ma hubo hadda.
I am so glad she did.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inay samaysay.
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aan adiga kaa hadlo.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma qabo.
No one said anything.	Qofna wax uu sheego ma jirin.
.	.
Only for others.	Kaliya dadka kale.
It is better not to say too much.	Waxaa fiican in aan wax badan la odhan.
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
It will come.	Way iman doontaa.
I can't help it.	Ma caawin karo.
She would pay for everything.	Wax walba way bixin lahayd.
This is what she has to do.	Tani waa inay sameyso.
Maybe he even wants that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xitaa taas rabo.
He probably saw it all.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu wada arkay.
I know he would do it.	Waan ogahay inuu yeeli lahaa.
Each of us.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
Otherwise it is small.	Haddii kale way yar tahay.
It is better to take us.	Waxaa fiican in aan na qaado.
Good job, as always !.	Shaqo fiican, sida had iyo jeer!.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
There is no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
I hope to see you again, soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko, maalin dhow.
She didn't want to know.	Ma ay rabin inay ogaato.
As if he could not come here.	Sida in aanu halkan ka iman karin.
He thought it was better than it really was.	Waxa uu u maleynayay in ay ka wanaagsan tahay sidii ay dhab ahaantii ahayd.
I have no idea why.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin sababta.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
This did not help.	Tani ma caawin.
But why did he say that.	Laakiin sababta uu u sheegay.
In fact, less so.	Dhab ahaantii, in ka yar.
Not you.	Adiga ma aha.
It 's really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
It can happen here.	Waxay ka dhici kartaa halkan.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
If not, please let me know	Haddii kale, fadlan ii soo sheeg
He put it.	Wuu dhigay.
I think it's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay.
Not more fun	Ma sii xiiso badan
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
The best.	Ka ugu wanaagsan.
But for a while.	Laakiin in muddo ah.
No one can.	Qofna ma awoodo.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
I think that's right	Waxay ila tahay sax
That was a good day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
But they are very small.	Laakiin aad bay u yar yihiin.
It is definitely a good thing to do.	Hubaal waa wax fiican in la sameeyo.
They love it.	Way jecel yihiin.
We can not do this.	Ma samayn karno tan.
Someone else was always there.	Qof kale ayaa had iyo jeer joogay.
There was not much space.	Meel badan ma jirin.
But this was bad.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd mid xun.
They did not succeed.	Ma ay guulaysan.
He began to.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu.
This is likely to take a long time really.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inay qaadan doonto waqti dheer runtii.
There is nothing else but that.	Wax kale ma jiro taas aan ahayn.
For ideas please.	Wixii fikrad ah fadlan.
He knows you know he did it for you.	Wuu ogyahay inaad ogtahay inuu ku sameeyay.
You did that to me, before.	Taas ayaad igu samaysay, ka hor.
But I think.	Laakiin waxaan filayaa.
But not now.	Laakiin hadda ma jirto.
I really didn't want to go.	Runtii ma rabin inaan tago.
This is exactly what she wants.	Tani waa dhab ahaan waxa ay rabto.
How difficult it is.	Sida ay u adag tahay.
you were right	sax baad ahayd
One is enough.	Mid baa ku filan.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
You need more.	Wax badan ayaad u baahan tahay.
By now, everyone knew why.	Ilaa hadda, qof kastaa wuu ogaa sababta.
He became convinced.	Waxa uu noqday mid la hubo.
It is permanent.	Waa joogto.
I don't like what's going on here.	Ma jecli waxa halkan ka socda.
I am afraid of him.	Isaga waan ka baqayaa.
I had a great time.	Waxaan soo qaatay waqti aad u wanaagsan.
This is what happened.	Tani waa waxa dhacay.
I don't think that will happen.	U malayn maayo inay taasi dhici doonto.
Not a little.	Wax yar maaha.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
He is not a bad man.	Nin xun maaha.
I need to do that for myself.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan taas aniga ii sameeyo.
She is your favorite.	Waa adiga ay ku jeceshahay.
It is as it is now.	Waa sida ay tahay hadda.
That will be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
He really loves me.	Runtii wuu i jecel yahay.
Give it time.	Waqti sii.
I know you don't like me.	Waan ogahay inaadan i jeclayn.
No other time has been set.	Waqti kale lama qaban.
I think he does not like me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuusan i jeclayn.
Is this correct?	Tani ma sax baa?.
I would like a little	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax yar
As it was up to school too.	Sidii ay ahayd ilaa dugsiga sidoo kale.
I really want to be his friend.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiib u noqdo.
Available at any job.	Waxaa laga heli karaa shaqo kasta.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
I do not know which one it was.	Ma garanayo mid ay ahayd.
Everything is there.	Wax walba waa jiraan.
I have a better idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad ka fiican.
He wanted to see.	Wuxuu rabay inuu arko.
You must not do it.	Waa inaadan samayn.
There should be no problem with that.	Ma aha in ay dhibaato ka jirto taas.
That may be true.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa run.
It was never said again.	Mar dambe lama odhan.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
He did not know where he was going.	Meel uu aado ma uu garanayn.
But, it can be difficult.	Laakiin, waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
That's how it was.	Taasi waa sidii ay ahayd.
He has not been there before.	Hore uma uu joogin.
You can not expect anything.	Waxba ma filan kartid.
I was there.	Halkaas ayaan u joogay.
You do not need to do this.	Uma baahnid inaad tan sameyso.
I had some luck.	Waxaan lahaa xoogaa nasiib ah.
But there was something.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax.
For me, that is what it is.	Aniga, waa waxa ay tahay.
To find a common ground.	Si loo helo meel la wada leeyahay.
There is no money.	Lacag ma jirto.
So you are like me.	Sidaas ayaad aniga ila mid tahay.
You are like him.	Waxaad la mid tahay isaga.
I knew you would come.	Waan ogaa inaad iman doonto.
you are real.	dhab baad tahay.
I have never said anything very good.	Weligay wax aad u wanaagsan ma odhan.
No one else can do it.	Qof kale ma samayn karo.
I decided to find out.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan ogaado.
She is very good at him.	Aad bay ugu fiican tahay isaga.
I thought there were a few.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay jiraan wax yar.
But not now.	Laakiin hadda sidaas maaha.
I couldn't do anything wrong.	Wax xun ma sameyn karin.
He may not want to talk about it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan rabin inuu ka hadlo.
I went to him.	waan u aaday.
He should know that.	Waa inuu taas ogaado.
I want to know what happened	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay
But he wants her to know what will happen.	Laakiin wuxuu rabaa inay ogaato waxa dhici doona.
And I hope it came out here.	Oo waxaan rajeynayaa in halkan ka soo baxay.
He did not return immediately.	Degdeg uma soo noqon.
I want it soon	Waxaan rabaa dhawaan
They did not stop.	Ma ay joojin.
Let's do this together.	Aan wada samayno tan.
It's amazing how they do it.	Waa yaab sida ay u sameeyaan.
It would be but.	Waxay noqon lahayd laakiin.
One went out.	Mid baa ka baxay.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
Everyone is ready to help someone else.	Mid kastaa wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu caawiyo qof kale.
Right at first.	Isla marka hore.
I still don't know who you are.	Wali ma garanayo qofka aad tahay.
Very happy so far.	Aad u faraxsan ilaa hadda.
That would be all.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd dhammaan.
He felt something new.	Wax cusub ayuu dareemay.
What else can she.	Maxaa kale oo ay kartaa.
I have heard a lot from you.	Wax badan ayaan kaa maqlay.
Only I know this.	Kaliya tan waan ogahay.
This is very big and complicated.	Tani waa mid aad u weyn oo dhib badan.
I should have been here.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaan joogo.
Lots of good food.	Cunto badan oo wanaagsan.
I just don't want to	Kaliya ma rabo
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
That is a thing.	Taasi waa wax.
Really something for everyone.	Runtii wax qof walba u ah.
It's hard to get out.	Way adag tahay in laga baxo.
It is called hard work.	Waxaa loo yaqaan shaqo adag.
That was tough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
The same place it belongs to.	Isla meesha ay iska leedahay.
I have no idea what it is.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay.
A lot.	Wax badan.
He said he liked that.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu taas ka helay.
I will take it.	waan qaadan doonaa.
That was a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
It is very, very difficult to really do it.	Aad iyo aad bay u adag tahay in dhab ahaantii la sameeyo.
He really wasn't there.	Runtii ma uu ahayn halkaas.
I'm not lucky.	Nasiib ma ihi.
They are the people.	Waa dadka.
That would be tomorrow.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd berri.
Maybe it was him.	Malaha isaga ayuu ahaa.
Not a big problem, but it is a problem.	Dhib weyn maaha, laakiin waa dhibaato.
But not everyone can do this.	Laakiin qof kastaa ma samayn karo tan.
I just have to eat.	Kaliya waa inaan wax cuno.
But it is not !.	Laakiin ma aha!.
This can happen over time.	Tani waxay dhici kartaa in ka badan waqti ka dib.
So do all the others.	Sidaas oo kale dhammaan dadka kale.
That is the only thing that will happen.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee dhici doona.
A lot is going on.	Wax badan ayaa socda.
Berri is arag !.	Berri is arag!.
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
They're so big, you know.	Way aad u weyn yihiin, waad ogtahay.
Everyone says so.	Qof kastaa sidaas ayuu leeyahay.
I would do the same.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax la mid ah.
You came into this.	Adiga ayaa tan soo galay.
I never got him anything.	Weligay ma helin isaga wax kasta.
But do not do it again.	Laakiin mar kale ha samayn.
Beautiful too.	Qurux badan sidoo kale.
I do not know what will happen.	Ma garanayo waxa dhici doona.
Something strange happened.	Wax la yaab leh ayaa ka dhacay .
In fact, it wasn’t too bad.	Dhab ahaantii, ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
It was not too long ago.	Wax aad u dheer ka hor ma ahayn.
To make more money.	Si aad lacag badan u samayso.
I was there	waan joogay
Just how things are.	Kaliya sida ay wax yihiin.
He didn't want her to know yet.	Ma uusan rabin in ay ogaato weli.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
I am very sorry	Aad ayaan uga xumahay
It can actually come from anywhere.	Runtii meel kasta way ka iman kartaa.
But that is surprising.	Laakiin taasi waa yaab.
"I found you," he said.	waan ku helay ayuu is yidhi.
But something felt.	Laakiin wax baa dareemay.
You can go to school.	Waxaad aadi kartaa dugsiga.
He wanted to leave as best he could.	Wuxuu rabay inuu baxo sida ugu wanaagsan.
I do not like to be told what to do.	Ma jecli in la ii sheego waxa aan sameeyo.
It cannot be more than one.	Ma noqon karo wax ka badan hal.
I was for it.	Waxaan u ahaa.
I tried to talk about him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ka hadlo isaga.
If you could get a little out of it, that would be great.	Haddii aad wax yar ka bixi karto, taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
As it was, it was not.	Sida ay ahayd, ma uu ahayn.
I still hope someone does, but no one will be me.	Weli waxaan rajeynayaa in qof sameeyo, laakiin qofna ma noqon doono aniga.
Something similar happened.	Wax la mid ah ayaa dhacay.
I just wanted to know what to do.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan ogaado inaad sameyso.
There was so much more.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa jiray.
Now you can do it	Hadda waad samayn kartaa
Every time you do you will see new things.	Mar kasta oo aad sameyso waxaad arki doontaa waxyaabo cusub.
I can't talk to him.	Ma la hadli karo isaga.
I told him I would not do that.	Waxaan u sheegay inaanan sidaas yeeli doonin.
you did not do that.	ma aadan samayn taas.
This is also not true.	Tani sidoo kale run maaha.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
This can be very interesting.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Enough truth as well.	Run ku filan sidoo kale.
Every day.	Maalin walba.
Maybe I did the same thing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sameeyay wax la mid ah.
Real beauty.	Qurux dhab ah.
He knew this.	Wuu ogaa tan.
Too bad	Waxyaabo aad u xun
You are good.	Waad fiican tahay.
Not him, not now.	Isaga maaha, hadda maaha.
That would not be true.	Taasi run ma ahaan lahayd.
He may be able to find out.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu awoodo inuu ogaado.
He knew what you were doing.	Wuu ogaa waxaad samaynayso.
Someone else has seen this.	Qof kale ayaa arkay tan.
It's like you were someone else.	Waxay la mid tahay inaad qof kale ahayd.
Every day now.	Maalin kasta hadda.
That is what he does.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyo.
This was not.	Tani ma ahayn.
They may not understand.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan fahmin.
Now, and always.	Hadda, iyo had iyo jeer.
He really didn't know why.	Runtii ma uu garanayn sababta.
This can be found here.	Tani waa la heli karaa halkan.
There is no time today.	Maanta waqti ma jiro.
Most are better.	Inta badan ayaa ka fiican.
I may be able to do this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan tan sameeyo.
Mary, that's right.	Maryan, taasi waa sax.
We were right, there.	Waxaan ahayn sax, halkaas.
I got enough	Waxaan helay ku filan
I did not know he would be here.	Maan ogayn inuu halkan joogi doono.
No one saw him.	Cidna ma uu arag.
Great and great.	Mid weyn oo weyn.
That should be expected.	Taasi waa in la filayaa.
After a while, no one wanted to talk about it.	Muddo ka dib, qofna ma rabin inuu ka hadlo.
I need to do that.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan taas sameeyo.
It is again.	Waa mar kale.
But it is me.	Laakiin waa aniga.
I am for it.	Waxaan u ahay.
Otherwise it will not happen.	Haddii kale ma dhici doonto.
Both are correct.	Labaduba waa sax.
The same may be true here.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa laga yaabaa inay run tahay halkan.
No one knows what it is.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa uu yahay.
He said there was nothing too difficult.	Wuxuu sheegay in aysan jirin wax aad u dhib badan.
It was hard.	Waxay ahayd adag.
I can tell you how to go for one.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa sida loo tago mid ka mid ah.
It has the best location, the closest to everything.	Waxay leedahay meesha ugu fiican, aad ugu dhow wax walba.
This is a lie.	Tani waa been.
You will love it for sure.	Waad jeclaan doontaa hubaal.
I need to go home	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan aado guriga
It's a little bit.	Waa wax yar.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
She said to herself.	Way is tidhi.
This was to be done.	Tani waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
Something for everyone.	Wax qof walba leh.
He arrived in a short time.	Waqti yar ayuu ku yimid.
Maybe it is now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hadda tahay.
Now I know this is not true.	Hadda waxaan ogahay in tani aysan run ahayn.
It may not be for money.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan lacag u ahayn.
This is a great opportunity for me.	Tani waxay ii tahay fursad weyn.
Always, really.	Mar walba, dhab ahaantii.
He got food.	Cunto ayuu helay.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
No one else would see it, but he would.	Qof kale ma arki lahaa, laakiin wuu lahaa.
But it really is not.	Laakiin runtii maaha.
That is the house.	Taasi waa guriga.
One has been with us for some time.	Mid baa in muddo ah nala joogay.
I gave you a little.	Wax yar baan ku siiyay.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I'm sure he would like it, you know.	Waxaan hubaa inuu jeclaan lahaa, waad ogtahay.
That you would say something.	In aad wax ku odhan lahayd.
It should be needed.	Waa in loo baahan yahay.
I am still.	weli waan ahay.
I had a friend.	Waxaan lahaa saaxiib.
No one was here.	Halkan qofna ma joogin.
I am very serious.	Aad baan u dhab ahay.
I need to work	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan shaqeeyo
As the person he was now.	Sida qofka uu hadda ahaa.
In fact, you can do more than this.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka badan tan.
He is happy to be back.	Wuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu dib u helo.
Maybe he should.	Malaha waa inuu.
It may not matter to us.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay waxba nagu lahayn.
Before she could say.	Ka hor inta aanay odhan lahaa.
It was before anything else.	Waxay ahayd ka hor wax kale.
There is no time.	Waqti ma jiro.
I can't say anything.	Waxba kama odhan karo.
I would spend time every day.	Waxaan waqti ku qaadan lahaa lacag maalin kasta.
I just don’t know what to get.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxaan helo.
I'm sure you know that.	Waan hubaa inaad taas ogtahay.
That was a terrible time.	Taasi waxay ahayd waqti aad u xun.
It is a small place.	Waa meel yar.
It can be a problem.	Waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
I can take it	waan qaadan karaa
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
And you say you have not seen.	Oo waxaad leedahay ma aadan arag.
He said he did not understand.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu fahmin.
I wanted to tell you that.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas kuu sheego.
Don't do that again.	Mar dambe taas ha samayn.
This is called.	Tan waxaa loo yaqaan.
I'm afraid they are too small.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay aad u yar yihiin.
We will get the best out of it.	Sida ugu fiican waanu heli doonaa.
No one is sure what to do about it.	Qofna ma hubo waxa laga samaynayo.
What else can he do?	Maxaa kale oo uu samayn karaa.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
I don't see why.	Ma arko sababta.
You can not go yet	Wali ma aadi kartid
I will do what I will do.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa waxaan sameyn doono.
Just like you.	Sida aad kaliya.
I want to study and work.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax barto oo shaqeeyo.
There is so much here.	Waxaa jira wax badan halkan.
Maybe another man is surprised.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in nin kale la yaab leh.
A lot is going on for you.	Wax badan ayaa kuu socda.
It is him.	Waa isaga.
I would like to be like that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sidaas noqdo.
I did not know what it was.	Maan garanayn waxa ay tahay.
But he said he could see.	Laakiin wuxuu sheegay inuu arki karo.
They will let me know.	Way ii soo sheegi doonaan.
You can do what you like.	Waxaad samayn kartaa waxaad jeceshahay.
He had to do something.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax sameeyo.
I wonder what she did.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxay samaysay.
That was not a lie.	Taasi been ma ahayn.
Big and small, to small.	Weyn iyo mid yar, ilaa yar.
That is where she is.	Waa halka ay joogto.
Apparently he was trying to say something about it.	Waxa iska cad in uu isku dayay in uu wax ka sheego.
She would say little.	Wax yar bay odhan lahayd.
Like someone who is not at home.	Sidii qof aan guriga joogin.
And let me tell you - it was all there.	Oo aan kuu sheego in ay wax walba ku jiraan.
Everything can be removed	Wax walba waa laga bixi karaa
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Laakiin ma jirto wax aan ka qaban karno taas.
I don't want that.	Taas cidna uma rabo.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba uma sheegin.
Everyone saw what happened.	Qof kastaa wuu arkay waxa dhacay.
This is really well done.	Tani runtii si wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
I am not often.	Sida badan ma ihi.
That, too, is difficult.	Taasi, sidoo kale, way adag tahay.
Let it work for you.	Ha kuu shaqeeyo.
There was no one.	Cidna ma jirin.
Everyone will help.	Qof kastaa wuu caawin doonaa.
I knew I would do it.	Waan ogaa inaan sameyn doono.
I wanted you to know.	Waxaan rabay inaad ogaato.
I had so much to say to everyone.	Waxaan lahaa wax badan oo aan ku sheego qof kasta.
You will soon see everyone.	Waxaad dhawaan arki doontaa qof kasta.
He was there.	Halkaas ayuu joogay.
It has been so far.	Waxay ahayd ilaa hadda.
No one won.	Qofna ma guulaysan.
You have done well.	Wax fiican baad samaysay.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
But it could be better than it is.	Laakiin way ka sii fiicnaan kartaa sida ay tahay.
I know more than most.	Waan ogahay in ka badan inta badan.
This is a very exciting time for you.	Tani waa wakhti aad u xiiso badan adiga.
Everyone was busy.	Qof kastaa mashquul buu ahaa.
He seems familiar, too.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid la yaqaan, sidoo kale.
To see you again.	Si aan mar kale ku arko.
In fact, it was a terrible place.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd meel aad u xun.
And he began to want new things.	Oo wuxuu bilaabay inuu rabo waxyaabo cusub.
I will never be the same.	Weligay isku mid ahaan maayo.
I hold myself.	Waan isku hayaa.
I was just surprised.	Kaliya waan yaabay.
There is something strange.	Waxaa jira wax yaab leh.
It could be tonight	Waxay noqon kartaa caawa
Tall man.	Nin dheer.
Maybe so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas u fiican tahay.
All on the same day.	Dhammaan isku maalin.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
Everything else is the same.	Wax kasta oo kale waa isku mid.
Not yet.	Weli ma jirin.
He gave it to me.	Wuu i siiyay.
I do not have.	Ma haysto.
But maybe not a good idea.	Laakiin malaha fikrad fiican maaha.
He was at work.	Shaqada ayuu ku jiray.
She still couldn't believe it.	Wali way rumaysan wayday.
We cannot say for sure.	Taas ma odhan karno hubaal.
She told me she loved you.	Waxay ii sheegtay inay ku jeceshahay.
I will not tell him.	U sheegi maayo.
This can be great.	Tani way fiicnaan kartaa.
It looks amazing.	Waxay u egtahay wax yaab leh.
But they may not give you what you want.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ku siin waxaad rabto.
I knew what he was trying to do.	Waan ogaa waxa uu isku dayay inuu sameeyo.
I said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
Something to do.	Wax la sameeyo.
Nothing to find.	Wax la helo ma jiraan.
What was it.	Muxuu ahaa.
They did not understand him.	Ma ay fahmin isaga.
Here, everyone had a place.	Halkan, qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa meel.
Even that is a lot.	Xitaa taasi waa wax badan.
The only thing.	Waxa kaliya ee.
But now she has not left.	Laakiin hadda way ka tagi weyday.
I love him as a friend.	Waxaan isaga u jeclahay saaxiib ahaan.
I will assume that this is correct.	Waxaan qaadan doonaa in tani ay sax tahay.
He had to say something.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax sheego.
It is also important to note this.	Waa sidoo kale in la ogaado tan.
Don't say too much.	Wax badan ha ka odhan.
She didn't need to say how much she loved me.	Uma baahnayn inay sheegto inta ay i jeceshahay.
She said nothing.	Waxba uma ay sheegin.
She doesn't want to.	Ma aha inay rabto.
I'll talk about it tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
She would break up.	Way kala tagi lahayd.
She still has.	Weli way leedahay.
If you want one.	Haddii aad mid rabto.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
It is the same.	Waa isku mid.
But that's the way it is.	Laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
You can't help but do that.	Ma caawin kartid inaad taas sameyso.
.	.
They are almost there.	Waxay ku dhow yihiin halkaas.
He did this regularly.	Si joogto ah ayuu tan u sameeyay.
Still in school.	Weli dugsiga.
Obviously, a lot needs to be said.	Sida cad, wax badan ayaa loo baahan yahay in la sheego.
But he did not know that.	Laakiin taas ma uu ogayn.
You can't find anything better than that.	Ma heli kartid wax ka wanaagsan taas.
In fact, she had several.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay lahayd dhowr.
Someone came in through the front door.	Qof ayaa ka soo galay albaabka hore.
That I will come now.	Taas hadda waan iman doonaa.
I can't get to work.	Ma heli karo in aan shaqeeyo.
Nothing to say.	Wax aan la sheegin.
I knew you would find me.	Waan ogaa inaad i heli doonto.
She just didn't understand.	Kaliya ma ay fahmin.
So he came here.	Sidaas ayuu halkan ku yimid.
I have one man.	Waxaan leeyahay hal nin.
Then.	Ka dib .
Nin.	Nin.
One made for me.	Mid la ii sameeyay.
But enough is enough.	Laakiin ku filan ayaa ku filan.
I still have it, too.	Wali waan hayaa, sidoo kale.
They are really good and very interesting.	Runtii aad bay u fiican yihiin oo aad bay u xiiso badan yihiin.
I am very happy.	Aad baan u faraxsanahay.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
But maybe it was.	Laakiin malaha waxay ahayd.
Everyone knows this.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa tan.
I will get it, please.	Waan heli doonaa, fadlan.
You will love this one.	Waad jeclaan doontaa kan.
Just that she did.	Kaliya in ay samaysay.
I have nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo aan aado ma jirto.
He had a problem.	Dhib buu lahaa.
I think there is more to it than that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jiraan wax ka badan taas.
It would be reported.	Waa la soo sheegi lahaa.
This is really a lie.	Runtii tani waa been.
It was not like now.	Ma ahayn sida hadda.
And not to find me again.	Iyo inaan mar dambe i helin.
I could not speak here.	Halkan kuma aan hadli karin.
All of him.	Isaga oo dhan.
I can't find it now	Hadda ma heli karo
He expects me to be there.	Wuxuu iga filayaa inaan halkaas joogo.
I hope you can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad caawin karto.
He heard me	Wuu i maqlay
See you tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ku arki doonaa.
There is no time to do that.	Ma jirto wakhti taas la sameeyo.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
I was surprised that she would even do that.	Waxaan la yaabay inay taasi xitaa sameyn doonto.
I fell for it today.	Maanta ayaan ku soo dhacay.
It was never said again.	Mar dambe lama odhan.
Please can you help me find it.	Fadlan ma iga caawin kartaa inaan helo.
They should not give one.	Waa in aanay siin mid.
I could not believe she was doing something like that.	Ma rumaysan karin inay samaynayso wax sidaas oo kale ah.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
He did not say this.	Ma uusan odhan tan.
This is what it looks like.	Tani waxay u egtahay.
He was like.	Wuxuu ahaa sida.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
He will be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
It is not a lie.	Been maaha.
I could not see anyone.	Qofna maan arki karin.
I don't mind.	Dhib uma arko.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
That was not to be talked about.	Taasi ma ahayn in la hadlo.
Nobody.	Qofna.
I bought three.	Waxaan iibsaday saddex.
I didn’t know what she was doing there.	Ma garanayn waxa ay halkaas ka samaynayso.
I would like to know how to do it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sida loo sameeyo.
That is a long time.	Taasi waa wakhti dheer.
I haven't been back for a while.	In muddo ah maan soo noqon.
I can't take much	Wax badan ma qaadan karo
It was really fun.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
But it doesn't matter.	Laakiin waxba maaha.
I would do more.	Wax badan ayaan qaban lahaa.
It is not said what they will do with it.	Lama sheegin waxay ku samayn doonaan.
I can't stop.	Ima joojin kartid.
This is a real opportunity.	Tani waa fursad dhab ah.
I can't get enough.	Wax ku filan ma heli karo.
More would come.	Wax badan ayaa iman lahaa.
This is what.	Tani waa waxa.
As you are.	Sida aad tahay.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Wax xun kuma jiro.
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
I am him.	aniga ayaa ah isaga.
This is not true.	Runtii tani run maaha.
What a beautiful idea.	Waa maxay fikrad qurux badan.
And another strike.	Iyo shaqo joojin kale.
More good things are coming.	Waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan ayaa soo socda.
We have always been robbed.	Mar walba waa nala dhacay.
I don’t even know what to do with that.	Xitaa ma garanayo waxa aan ku sameeyo taas.
Quickly found	Degdeg u helay
It looks like it might come out today.	Waxay u egtahay inay maanta soo bixi karto.
That’s so beautiful, that’s just me.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan, taasi waa aniga kaliya.
Lots to see.	Wax badan la arkay.
He did not get it.	Ma uusan helin.
Everything else would be better than this.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa ka fiicnaan lahaa kan.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax fiican.
But I didn't need much time.	Laakiin uma baahnayn waqti badan.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale ma jirto.
Do not take it seriously.	Si dhab ah ha u qaadan.
According to him.	Sida uu sheegay.
This is the best yet.	Tani waa tan ugu fiican weli.
But most do not.	Laakiin inta badan ma sameeyaan.
Now this.	Hadda kan.
It was just supposed.	Waxay ahayd oo kaliya loo maleeyay.
It will be amazing.	Waxay noqon doontaa yaab.
Still, it had to be done.	Weli, waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
You can say they are close.	Waxaad sheegi kartaa inay isku dhow yihiin.
Everyone needs help.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu caawiyo.
Probably the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ugu fiican tahay.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
I need to know if it is correct.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inay sax tahay.
We need him.	Waanu u baahanahay isaga.
It would be a beautiful place.	Waxay ahaan lahayd meel qurux badan.
It's worse than that.	Way ka xun tahay taas.
They were not present.	Ma ay joogin.
This will happen.	Tani way dhici doontaa.
It is a very difficult job.	Waa shaqo aad u adag.
She had to stay home.	Waxay ahayd inay guriga sii joogto.
I know it's nothing, but still.	Waan ogahay inaysan waxba ahayn, laakiin weli.
I can be anything.	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta.
I look forward to it.	Aad ayaan u rajeynayaa.
But me.	Laakiin aniga.
Good man.	Nin wanaagsan.
I decided not to mention.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan sheegin.
And he will need more.	Oo wax badan ayuu u baahan doonaa.
Maybe he’s really a great guy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu runtii yahay nin weyn.
I want you to do this for me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad tan ii samayso.
I can take time and work.	Waxaan qaadan karaa waqti iyo shaqada.
I will do everything	wax walba waan samayn doonaa
You can see.	Waad arki kartaa.
not you.	ma adiga.
I got nothing better than this.	Wax ka fiican kama helin tan.
Maybe it was everything else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd wax kale oo dhan.
No one is what you think of me.	Qofna ma aha waxa aad aniga ila tahay.
That was not true.	Taasi run ma ahayn.
No one will say so.	Qofna sidaas u odhan maayo.
But it is better than nothing.	Laakiin way ka fiican tahay waxba.
So fast.	Sidaas ayaa degdeg ah.
But I'm not sure how to do it.	Laakiin ma hubo sida loo sameeyo.
Mostly that is true.	Inta badan taasi waa run.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
But you could not.	Laakiin waad awoodi wayday.
You can give it to me.	Waad i siin kartaa.
I don't like you.	kuma jecla.
Now I come to that.	Hadda ayaan soo galay taas.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
You think so, no.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa taas, ma aha.
It really doesn’t seem hard to do.	Runtii uma eka wax adag in la sameeyo.
Now there is something.	Hadda wax baa jira.
Not after a day.	Ma aha maalin ka dib.
This was what she did.	Tani waxay ahayd waxay samaysay.
And she thinks.	Oo waxay u malaynaysaa.
I saw that it was done.	Waxaan arkay in la sameeyay.
She is very young and she loves it and.	Aad bay u yar tahay oo aad bay u jeceshahay iyo.
Everyone says so.	Qof kastaa sidaas ayuu yidhi.
They are very small	Aad bay u yar yihiin
Both exist, both are true.	Labaduba waa jiraan, labaduba waa run.
It was more than he had ever done.	Waxay ahayd wax ka badan sidii uu waligiis samayn lahaa.
Same as the main one.	La mid ah kan ugu weyn.
That will not do.	Taasi ma yeeli doonto.
But so far they have not found it.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma aysan helin.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
But I can't stay here for long.	Laakiin halkan wakhti dheer ma sii joogi karo.
Someone will do it but it doesn't look like it will be for us.	Qof ayaa samayn doona laakiin uma eka inay nagu noqon doonto.
This is not just you.	Tani adiga kaliya maaha.
Something good happened as well.	Wax wanaagsan ayaa dhacay sidoo kale.
That is.	Taasi waa.
I'm scared.	Waxaan ka baqayaa.
It was he would not say.	Waxa ay ahayd ma uu odhan lahaa.
I'm just happy to be there.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaas joogo.
I haven't seen him in a while.	In muddo ah kuma arag.
He knew they didn't believe him.	Wuu ogaa in aanay rumaysan isaga.
Let's do it now !.	Aan samayno hadda!.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
I don't want to stay	Ma rabo inaan joogo
It's really hard.	Runtii aad bay u adag tahay.
I did	waan sameeyay
It's true.	Waa run.
I decided.	Waxaan go'aansaday.
I hope to see you soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan ku arko.
I knew he was in trouble.	Waan ogaa inuu dhib ku jiro.
Not only that, everywhere.	Ma aha oo kaliya, meel kasta.
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
A good place.	Meel fiican.
Sure.	Hubaal.
And somewhere.	Iyo meel.
I may be able to help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan caawiyo.
But he lied.	Laakiin been buu sheegay.
You made a friend.	Waad samaysay saaxiib.
We will be great friends.	Waxaan noqon doonaa saaxiibo weyn.
Not often.	Ma aha inta badan.
But that is not a big deal.	Laakiin taasi wax weyn maaha.
I do not know where to go.	Meel aan aado ma garanayo.
That's right now.	Waa sidaas hadda.
Once he got it.	Mar ayuu helay.
That and that alone.	Taas iyo taas kaliya.
They are, really.	Waxay yihiin, runtii.
It was a thing of the past.	Waxay ahayd wax laga tagay.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad u qurux badan tahay.
I went in to get something.	Waxaan galay si aan wax u helo.
You will see this clearly here.	Taas waxaad si cad uga arki doontaa halkan.
That is unfortunate.	Taasi nasiib maaha.
Few people know me better.	Inta yar ee dadka iga yaqaan ayaa ka sii fiican.
I did the same.	Waxaan sameeyay sidaas oo kale.
I just go.	Kaliya waan tagi.
Tell me more.	Wax badan ii sheeg.
Good as new.	U fiican sida cusub.
Here is what he found.	Waa kan waxa uu helay.
I will be back soon.	Waxaan dib u noqon doonaa dhawaan.
I'm glad she did.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay samaysay.
You do not have to do anything else.	Ma aha inaad wax kale samayso.
To find out.	Si aad u ogaato.
I have seen, now.	Waan arkay, hadda.
It is not a job.	Ma aha shaqo.
But he did not go.	Laakiin ma tagin.
I would like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa.
It's me and you.	Waa aniga iyo adiga.
No one really thinks so.	Qofna dhab ahaantii uma maleynayo.
He is working hard.	Shaqo adag ayuu hayaa.
It was really right.	Runtii sax bay ahayd.
This is true for many of us.	Tani waa run in badan oo naga mid ah.
We will see again.	Mar kale ayaan arki doonaa.
It's a terrible thing.	Waa wax aad u xun.
And it wasn’t too bad.	Oo ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
That is a lot.	Taasi waa wax badan.
It can stay.	Way joogi kartaa.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
Only you know.	Kaliya waad ogtahay.
Another went.	Mid kale ayaa tagay.
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
Not that much.	Ma aha in ay u badan tahay.
Hold on, stop	Qabo, jooji
I do not understand what happened.	Ma fahmin waxa dhacay.
I am new to this.	Waxaan ahay qof ku cusub kan.
But it really is not.	Laakiin run ahaantii maaha.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
She could not leave.	Way bixi wayday.
I don't seem to be working on it.	Uma eka in aan ku shaqeeyo.
He did not say so.	Ma aha inuu sidaas yidhi.
Very bad.	Aad u xun.
We can't have it now.	Hadda ma haysan karno.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax ma aha.
Hold on tight.	Si adag u qabo.
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
Now he could not do anything right.	Hadda wax sax ah ma uu samayn karin.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
But now everyone has seen it.	Laakiin hadda qof kastaa wuu arkay.
It was a few years ago.	Waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
Everyone came in.	Qof kastaa wuu soo galay.
This will do.	Tani waxay sameyn doontaa.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii.
I am the one who did it.	Waa aniga kan sameeyay.
There is nothing so great.	Ma jiro wax sidaas u weyn.
Not now, he said.	Hadda maaha, ayuu yidhi.
I can still see him.	Wali waan arki karaa isaga.
This may not happen, but it is, it is true.	Tani ma dhici karto, laakiin waa, waa run.
It can do this.	Way samayn kartaa tan.
As someone happy.	Sida qof u faraxsan yahay.
Maybe it's better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay u fiican tahay.
Now, it is not.	Hadda, ma aha.
That is what will happen.	Taasi waa waxa dhici doona.
Now she says.	Hadda waxay leedahay.
He is the best.	Isaga ayaa ugu fiican.
It's me and you.	Waa aniga iyo adiga.
Still, it may be true.	Weli, waxay noqon kartaa run.
Everything she does is good for her.	Wax kasta oo ay samayso way ku fiican tahay.
He did not have enough to do.	Ma haysan wax ku filan oo uu sameeyo.
She knew it was a good thing.	Way ogaatay inay wax fiican tahay.
Don't stop anything.	Waxba ha u joojin.
I told him what had happened to me.	Waxaan u sheegay waxa igu dhacay.
Very close.	Aad ugu dhow.
They are good	Way fiican yihiin
He did not want to eat.	Ma uu rabin inuu wax cuno.
It really did for me.	Dhab ahaantii way ii samaysay.
I will do this.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa tan.
She is as good as anyone.	Waxay u fiican tahay sida qof kasta.
I don't know him.	Ma garanayo isaga.
I really do not know what to do now.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo hadda.
This is not what happened.	Tani ma aha waxa dhacay.
You can get it tomorrow.	Waad heli kartaa berrito.
I did and I did.	waan sameeyay oo sameeyay.
That is a good thing.	Taas oo runtii ah wax wanaagsan.
It’s all very interesting, really.	Dhammaan waa wax aad u xiiso badan, runtii.
He is a liar.	Waa qof aan been sheegi karin.
Good on me	Aniga ila fiican
Always, always, there was someone else there.	Had iyo jeer, had iyo jeer, waxaa jiray qof kale halkaas.
Recently, it was found.	Dhawaan, waa la helay.
This is what he wants and can do.	Tani waa waxa uu rabo oo uu ka qaban karo.
I can't say anything.	Waxba ma odhan karo.
Not too much.	Aad uma badna.
He became much more than that.	Waxa uu noqday qof aad uga badan.
Maybe not today.	Maanta malaha sidaas maaha.
Everyone knows him, everyone loves him.	Qof kastaa waa yaqaan isaga, qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay isaga.
I would do nothing.	Waxba waan samayn lahaa.
I was with him every day.	Maalin walba waan la joogay.
You can not see, you can hardly imagine.	Ma arki kartid, si dhib leh uma malayn kartid.
how are you.	sidee tahay.
We need to do it right.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan si sax ah u samayno.
She has to go.	Waa in ay aado.
But not today.	Laakiin maanta maaha.
Tell them what needs to be said.	U sheeg waxa loo baahan yahay in la sheego.
I got what you have	Waan helay waxaad leedahay
Really so much.	Runtii aad u badan.
Too much time.	Waqti aad u badan.
If you want something done right.	Haddii aad rabto in wax sax ah loo sameeyo.
This is not correct.	Tani maaha mid sax ah.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
I do not eat much.	Wax badan ma cuno.
I don't want to go	Ma rabo inaan tago
Any time.	Waqti kasta.
I have never seen this before.	Weligay tan hore uma arag.
But it is really true.	Laakiin runtii waa run.
It was not a job.	Shaqo ma ahayn.
And if she would stay home.	Oo haddii ay guriga joogi lahayd.
we will see you again	dib ayaan ku arki doonaa
Maybe one day.	Malaha hal maalin.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I left you alone.	Keligaa waan kaa tagay.
I know he will like it.	Waan ogahay inuu jeclaan doono.
He knew he had it.	Wuu ogaa in uu haysto.
I will come out.	Waan soo bixi doonaa.
I wanted to enjoy it.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka helo.
I want to help	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
This is why.	Tani waa sababta.
But not just now.	Laakiin hadda kaliya maaha.
I want to do better.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo si ka sii fiican.
This is not common.	Tani ma badna.
But there is something better here.	Laakiin halkan wax ka fiican ayaa jira.
No, really.	Ma jirto, dhab ahaantii.
You can take it, if you do not do anything about it.	Waad u qaadan kartaa isaga, haddii aadan waxba ka qaban.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii cad.
It was enough.	Waxay ahayd ku filan.
But he did not know.	Laakiin taas ma uu ogayn.
That is why he lives in school.	Taasi waa sababta uu ugu nool yahay dugsiga.
I would love to work again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale shaqeeyo
That would be the worst of all.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd waxa ugu xun oo dhan.
I think it's a great idea.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay fikrad weyn.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab yaab.
I never have it.	Waligiis ma haysto.
I knew she still loved me.	Waan ogaa inay wali i jeceshahay.
You love them, they love you.	Waad jeceshahay, way jecel yihiin.
Not after what he now sees.	Ma ka dib waxa uu hadda arkay.
That will not happen.	In aanay dhici doonin.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
No one really knows everything.	Qofna runtii wax walba ma yaqaan.
I know he is just a person.	Waan ogahay inuu yahay qof kaliya.
He loves how we are.	Wuu jecel yahay sida aan u nahay.
I think he is happy.	Waxaan filayaa inuu faraxsan yahay.
It's all me.	Dhammaan waa aniga.
Not the same big.	Ma aha mid isla weyn.
He did not say why he came here.	Ma uusan sheegin sababta uu halkan u yimid.
Every day.	Maalin walba.
You can't do this again.	Mar kale tan ma samayn karto.
This is really good.	Tani runtii waa mid wanaagsan.
They no longer do it.	Mar dambe ma sameeyaan.
Why not.	Waa maxay sababta sababta.
It really looks like it used to be.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay sidii ay hore u ahayd.
In fact, it may be even smarter.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa laga yaabaa inay xitaa aad u caqli badan tahay.
I see no problem	Dhib ma arko
Here, no one.	Halkan, qofna ma jiro.
This is great.	Tani waa wax weyn.
They are long.	Way dheer yihiin.
That's it.	Waa taas.
She did what he said.	Waxay samaysay wuxuu yidhi.
I can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karo.
We are always friends.	Had iyo jeer waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
He would be.	Wuxuu noqon lahaa.
He knows what is expected of him.	Wuu garanayaa waxa isaga laga rabo.
Definitely a big problem.	Dhab ahaantii dhibaato weyn.
You can not imagine.	Ma malayn kartid.
It is something with me.	Waa wax ila jira.
It's more than that.	Way ka sii badan tahay.
You should not need it.	Waa in aadan u baahnayn.
He said yes.	Waa ayuu yidhi.
And there you have it.	Oo halkaas aad ku leedahay.
I wanted to see more.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax badan arko.
I really don't want to	Runtii ma rabo
I do not know if it is correct.	Ma garanayo inay sax tahay.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko.
And I did not leave.	Oo aan ka tagin.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
Please, let me help.	Fadlan, aan caawiyo.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I want to do it	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo
Probably nothing.	Malaha waxba.
I wanted to see the place again.	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale arko meesha.
That is well said.	Taas ayaa si fiican loo yidhi.
I had nothing to say.	Wax aan u sheego ma jirin.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
Not much fun here.	Ma ahan wax badan oo xiiso leh halkan.
Not a bit either.	Ma yara sidoo kale.
Maybe if.	Malaha haddii .
As if.	Sida haddii.
He made money.	Lacag buu sameeyay.
She thinks she is better than any of us.	Waxay u malaynaysaa inay naga fiican tahay mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
She was familiar.	Waxay ahayd la yaqaan.
I really need to do this.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan tan sameeyo.
I tried to work with you.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan kula shaqeeyo.
No idea yet.	Wali wax fikrad ah lama hayo.
What was there is no more.	Wixii ahaa hadda ma jiraan.
He had no other friend.	Saaxiib kale ma uu lahayn.
They didn't give him anything to do.	Wax uu sameeyo ma ay siin.
But it is still a problem.	Laakiin weli waa dhibaato.
He saw us one by one.	Mid mid buu noo arkay.
Certainly you will too.	Waa hubaal inaad sidoo kale ahaan doonto.
Stop it.	Jooji oo.
You may not know exactly what you need.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan si sax ah u garanayn waxaad u baahan tahay.
He could not.	Waa uu awoodi waayay.
This was not.	Tani ma ahayn.
And how long it would take.	Iyo inta ay qaadan lahayd.
I may not like it but she can do it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan jeclayn laakiin way samayn kartaa.
How can she let someone else.	Sidee bay u ogolaan kartaa qof kale.
It seems unbelievable.	Waxay u egtahay wax aan la rumaysan karin.
The only problem is that he is not here yet.	Dhibaato kaliya ayaa ah inuusan weli halkan joogin.
I want to leave something out.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka tago.
Like what happened.	Sida wixii dhacay.
Not true.	Run maaha.
That is a terrible thing to do.	Taasi waa wax aad u xun in la sameeyo.
And now.	Iyo hadda.
I saw enough.	Wax igu filan baan arkay.
It was a clear day.	Waxay ahayd maalin cad.
He wants the truth.	Run buu rabaa.
I thought they were all good.	Waxaan u maleeyay in dhammaan ay wanaagsan yihiin.
It wasn’t for me.	Ma ay jirin aniga.
I really am and see how much they love it.	Runtii waan ahay oo arag sida ay u jecel yihiin.
I like it	waan ka helay
There is nothing new here.	Ma jiro wax cusub halkan.
I'll tell you what it says.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa ay leedahay.
Why didn't she go home to help.	Maxay u tagi wayday guriga si ay u caawiso.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Waa markii aad soo noqon lahayd.
But that will not do either.	Laakiin taasi sidoo kale ma yeeli doonto.
The rest do not.	Inta kale ma sameeyaan.
I have nothing else to do, really.	Wax kale oo aan sameeyo ma hayo, runtii.
Something will happen.	Wax ayaa dhici doona.
That's why you did it.	Taasi waa sababta aad u samaysay.
There was nothing new there.	Ma jirin wax ku cusub halkaas.
But there is another.	Laakiin waxaa jira mid kale.
Not much.	Ma badna.
He and I are friends.	Aniga iyo isaga, waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
He knows food.	Cunto wuu yaqaan.
But he got it.	Laakiin wuu helay.
Only here and now.	Kaliya tan iyo halkan iyo hadda.
I can see it everywhere now.	Meel walba hadda waan uga muuqdaa.
It only happened once.	Mar kaliya ayuu dhacay.
He is just a man.	Waa nin kaliya.
But it can help.	Laakiin way ku caawin kartaa.
Car	Baabuur
I got enough of it	Waxaan helay wax igu filan
It was not just me.	Aniga kaliya ma ahayn.
This was good to know.	Tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan in la ogaado.
You are.	Waxaad tahay.
Very small, very large.	Aad u yar, aad u weyn.
I love, I love, I love.	Waan jeclahay, jeclahay, jeclahay.
I don't want to.	Ma rabto.
I just told you.	Hadda ayaan kuu sheegay.
Everyone knows what to do.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa waxa ay tahay inuu sameeyo.
A little bit.	Xoogaa yar.
That’s what put me in jail.	Waa waxa xabsiga iga dhigay.
Maybe she likes him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jeceshahay isaga.
I expect someone else to do the same.	Waxaan filayaa in qof kale uu sidaas oo kale sameeyo.
There is so much to discover here.	Wax badan ayaa jira halkan si aad u ogaato.
Wow, it's harder.	Way, way ka adag tahay.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I do not like one better than you.	Ma jecli mid adiga kaa fiican.
? 	?
There is nothing too exciting to say.	Ma jiro wax aad u xiiso badan oo laga sheego.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
It may not even exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa jirin.
But only.	Laakiin kaliya.
Wonder what happened.	Yaab waxa dhacay.
I will tell you.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa.
But there are.	Laakiin way jiraan.
I had no money.	Lacag ma haysan.
I can't see anything.	Waxba ma arki karo.
But what was that?	Laakiin maxay ahayd taasi.
It was a good idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
I love it too.	Waan jeclahay sidoo kale.
There is something else, too.	Wax kale ayaa jira, sidoo kale.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
No one can help me.	Qofna ma i caawin karaa.
Everything is as good as it gets.	Wax walba waa u wanaagsan yihiin sida ay yihiin.
This is not correct	Tani sax maaha
It didn't take long.	Waqti badan ma qaadan.
I can see it again, now.	Mar kale ayaan arki karaa, hadda.
I'm sure it's right.	Waan hubaa inay sax tahay.
Don't do it !.	Ha samayn!.
She was who she was.	Waxay ahayd qofka ay ahayd.
Like nowhere else.	Sida meel kale ma jirto.
I did not know where to go.	Meel aan aado maan garanayn.
Do not let him.	Ha u ogolaan isaga.
It has to be done, it has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa, waa in la sameeyaa.
He said they are.	Wuxuu sheegay inay yihiin.
No one has ever seen anything like it.	Qofna lama arag wax la mid ah.
Each took time.	Mid kastaa wuxuu qaatay waqti.
I bought one	Mid baan iibsaday
Not sure why, but it was quick.	Ma hubo sababta, laakiin waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
Nothing stopped.	Waxba ma joojin.
There is no help with that.	Ma jirto wax caawin ah taas.
I am very happy man.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay nin.
I am at home	Waxaan ahay guriga
As he said it will happen.	Sida uu sheegay wuu dhici doonaa.
The best can be done later.	Waxa ugu fiican ayaa la samayn karaa ka dib.
I think this is a great idea.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad aad u fiican.
There is nothing else, nothing less.	Wax kale ma jiraan, wax ka yar ma jiraan.
But that is old.	Laakiin taasi waa hore.
I saw a little more and less.	In yar iyo in ka yar ayaan arkay.
What did you say.	Maxaad tidhi.
Out.	Loo baxay.
It is everything.	Waa wax walba.
Then another good day, and another good day.	Ka dib maalin kale oo wanaagsan, iyo maalin kale oo wanaagsan.
It is a very bad idea.	Waa fikrad aad u xun.
Now I will take something, really.	Hadda wax baan qaadan doonaa, run ahaantii.
Mar mar.	Mar mar.
I did not see anything.	Waxba maan arag.
Good day.	Maalin wanaagsan.
I can come back and be surprised again.	Waan ku soo noqon karaa oo waan yaabanahay mar kale.
Now that would be something.	Hadda taasi wax bay ahaan lahayd.
At home, it could not be otherwise.	Guriga, si kale ma uu noqon karin.
Now.	Hadda .
You will be fine with this.	Waxaad u fiicnaan doontaa tan.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
It is something new.	Waa wax cusub.
No one, he said.	Qofna, ayuu yidhi.
It was invisible.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la arki karin.
No wonder.	La yaab maayo.
He lives here.	Halkan ayuu ku nool yahay.
Only, no time.	Kaliya, waqti ma leh.
I think it was found.	Waxaan filayaa in la helay.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay lahayn.
But it can be very interesting.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
I can't think of one now.	Ma malayn karo mid hadda.
It is a lie.	Waa been.
I heard what you want.	Waxaan maqlay waxaad rabto.
Making.	Samaynta.
I left	waan baxay
We will see how it is.	Waan arki doonaa sida uu yahay.
But it is longer than most.	Laakiin way ka sii dheer tahay inta badan.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
That is not a bad thing.	Taasi wax xun maaha.
I think he had.	Waxaan filayaa inuu lahaa.
We need more from you	Adiga ayaan uga baahanahay in ka badan
You do not need	Uma baahnid
I did it again.	Mar kale ayaan sameeyay.
I really don't want to talk about it.	Runtii ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
I need to see	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arko
They are just fun.	Waxay yihiin oo kaliya xiiso leh.
I am sure of that now.	Taas hadda waan hubaa.
You did what you did.	Waxaad samaysay waxaad ku samaysay.
She was a person.	Waxay ahayd qof.
He came.	Wuu yimid.
He was.	Waxa uu ahaa.
It would really be nice to see.	Runtii way fiicnaan lahayd in la arko.
It just doesn't seem right.	Kaliya uma eka mid sax ah.
I went in, no one was there.	Waan galay, qofna ma jirin.
Obviously not.	Si cad ma ahayn.
If you can get one.	Haddii aad mid heli karto.
He was a person.	Wuxuu ahaa qof.
I think you are surprised and surprised.	Waxaan filayaa inaad tahay yaab iyo yaab.
It's a little weird.	Waa yaab yar.
But it is a very difficult time.	Laakiin waa waqti aad u adag.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
After today.	Maanta ka dib.
He was very good.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u fiican.
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad wanaagsan.
But there was more.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
It was a problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato.
But tell me now.	Laakiin hadda ii sheeg.
I really can't help it	Runtii kuma caawin karo
Time for a man.	Waqti u nin.
Very long.	Aad uga dheer.
He thought he was beautiful.	Qurux buu is yidhi.
Much is clear.	In badan ayaa cad.
I did not find anything that told me that.	Ma helin wax taas ii sheegay.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
That is a very, very strange idea.	Taasi waa fikrad aad iyo aad u yaab badan.
Maybe she will lie.	Malaha been bay sheegi doontaa.
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
Too bad it is you and you.	Aad u xun waa adiga iyo adiga.
I will never do such a thing again.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah mar dambe ma samayn doono.
You are a very smart person.	Waxaad tahay qof caqli fiican leh.
I don't know why he is not.	Ma garanayo sababta uusan u ahayn.
You can find everything.	Waxaad ka heli kartaa wax kasta.
Why would that happen.	Maxay taasi u dhici lahayd.
She did it today.	Maanta way samaysay.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
Everything was done quickly.	Wax walba si degdeg ah ayaa loo sameeyay.
I found you	waan ku helay
This is still very bad.	Weli tani aad bay u xun tahay.
Do not go back.	Dib ha u noqon.
amazing.	yaab leh.
He told them to do the same.	Wuxuu u sheegay inay sidaas oo kale sameeyaan.
I knew how this would end up.	Waan ogaa sida ay tani ku dhammaan doonto.
busy enough for me	mashquul igu filan
You can come back	Waad soo noqon kartaa
Nothing will happen.	Waxba dhici maayo.
Which is not much for me.	Taas oo aan aniga wax badan ii ahayn.
This is something you can stop.	Tani waa wax aad joojin karto.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
But now, it is not mentioned here.	Laakiin hadda, halkan lama sheegin.
Don't think people are anything.	Ha u malayn dadka inay wax yihiin.
I can't go far	Meel dheer ma aadi karo
I guess you can't do that.	Waxaan filayaa inaadan taas samayn karin.
Not as expected.	Ma aha sidii la rabay.
He bought one.	Mid ka mid ah ayuu iibsaday.
For me, this is a good thing.	Aniga ahaan, tani waa wax wanaagsan.
There is nothing good about either.	Labaduba wax wanaagsan ma jiraan.
There was nothing worse.	Wax ka xun ma jirin.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jirto.
tell me you love me	ii sheeg inaad i jeceshahay.
Maybe you do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sameyso.
It's a lot of money.	Waa lacag aad u badan.
True, they are.	Run, way yihiin.
Everyone wants to go.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu tago.
He wants to talk to you.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu kula hadlo.
But that’s not true, either.	Laakiin taasi run maaha, sidoo kale.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
I have something for you.	Wax baan ku hayaa.
We cannot say why.	Ma sheegi karno sababta.
Not yet my favorite.	Wali ma ahan kan aan jeclahay.
It can be a few lucky ones.	Waxay noqon kartaa dhowr nasiib leh.
He wants it there.	Halkaas ayuu ka rabaa.
I told him no.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay jirin.
Take it any way you want.	U qaado si kasta oo aad rabto.
It was bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun.
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
It was not good now.	Si fiican uma ahayn hadda.
I will not tell you why.	Sababta ii sheegi maayo.
We will tell them all.	Waanu u wada sheegi doonaa.
Definitely here and there.	Hubaal halkan iyo halkaas.
It should not have existed.	Ma ahayn inay jirto.
Just to see how it is.	Kaliya si aan u arko sida ay tahay.
This is what they do.	Tani waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
He is mostly here.	Inta badan wuu joogaa halkan.
This is not difficult.	Tani ma aha mid adag.
Only new friends.	Kaliya saaxiibo cusub.
Everyone had.	Qof kastaa wuu lahaa.
But this is also very difficult to do.	Laakiin tani sidoo kale aad bay u adag tahay in la sameeyo.
But it was very small.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
We can't say.	Ma sheegi karno.
I also wish you well.	sidoo kale waan kuu rajeynayaa.
You did something	Wax baad samaysay
Not often.	Inta badan ma aha.
I hope all is well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in dhammaan ay wanaagsan yihiin.
I haven’t thought of anything in a while.	Waxba uma maleynayo in muddo ah.
Nothing can be seen here either.	Ma jiraan wax halkan lagu arki karo sidoo kale.
I'm just not sorry.	Waan ka xumahay kaliya maaha.
But he left.	Laakiin wuu baxay.
I have made that clear.	Taas si cad ayaan u sheegay.
It must have been.	Waa inay ahayd.
But soon you will be home.	Laakiin mar dhow guriga ayaad noqon doontaa.
That is not a problem now.	Taasi hadda dhib ma ahan.
I have heard good things about you.	Wax wanaagsan baan kaa maqlay.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
But he was more than just real.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa in ka badan oo kaliya dhab ah.
That can be a whole day.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa maalin dhan.
Give me something.	Wax i sii.
I want to see you	waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko
You need it	Waad u baahan tahay
No one will tell you that.	Qofna taas kuu sheegi maayo.
To me.	Ilaa aniga.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay.
Not everyone does what they like every day.	Ma aha in qof kastaa sameeyo waxa uu jecel yahay maalin kasta.
Everything seemed a little off.	Wax walba waxa u muuqday in yar.
It was really busy.	Runtii waxay ahayd mashquul.
He has been a great man for a while now.	Waxa uu ahaa nin weyn in muddo ah hadda.
I wanted to say.	Waxaan rabay inaan sheego.
I do not know why this is.	Ma garanayo sababta ay tani u tahay.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
She was smart.	Waxay ahayd caqli badan.
She thinks this is a good thing.	Waxay la tahay in tani ay tahay wax wanaagsan.
Really long time.	Runtii waqti dheer.
Really nice.	Runtii aad u fiican.
I do not like to be with you.	Ma jecli inaad ila joogto.
Now he has heard.	Hadda wuu maqlay.
Someone has to stay home.	Qof waa inuu guriga joogo.
Anyone can leave.	Qof walba wuu bixi karaa.
But obviously it cannot be where they are not.	Laakiin sida iska cad ma noqon karto meel aanay joogin.
I did not give anything.	Waxba ma siin.
But this is.	Laakiin tani waa.
That is the same thing you are doing now.	Taasi waa isla waxa aad hadda samaynayso.
I knew that very well.	Taas si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
Everyone knew this.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa tan.
It really is.	Runtii waa.
Maybe someone did.	Malaha qof baa sameeyay.
he must leave now.	waa inuu hadda baxo.
She can do this anytime she wants.	Waxay samayn kartaa taas wakhti kasta oo ay rabto.
You can't let him do that.	Uma ogolaan kartid inuu sidaas sameeyo.
You can do whatever you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
But something else happened.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa dhacay.
It was bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun.
But today is lucky.	Laakiin maanta waa nasiib.
For me, he said.	Aniga, ayuu yidhi.
I entered	waan galay
I felt that more could be done.	Waxaan dareemay in wax badan la qaban lahaa.
Not here	Halkan maaha
Probably not.	Malaha ma lahayn.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
He has not come before so hard and fast.	Hore uma uu iman si adag oo degdeg ah.
Everyone, everything.	Qof kasta, wax walba.
It's time	Waa wakhti
No one works hard.	Qofna si adag uma shaqeeyo.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
There was nothing close.	Wax u dhow ma jirin.
It is really nice to see him.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay in la arko isaga.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
No one wanted to make money.	Qofna ma doonayn inuu lacag sameeyo.
It is not too late.	Ma aha goor dambe.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
It really was a difficult time for me.	Runtii waxay ii ahayd wakhti adag.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
I expect a lot.	Wax badan ayaan filayaa.
I think this was it.	Waxaan filayaa inay tani ahayd.
Any problems, just let me know.	Dhibaato kasta, kaliya ii soo sheeg.
They are all owned.	Dhammaan waa la wada leeyahay.
Probably also true.	Malaha sidoo kale run.
I will stay there	halkaas ayaan joogi doonaa
I knew nothing about this.	Waxba kama ogayn arrintan.
Lucky man.	Nin nasiib badan.
Nothing for you right now.	Waxba adiga hadda ma jirto.
You will do what is said.	Waxaad samayn doontaa wixii lagu yidhi.
Just pick one.	Kaliya soo qaado mid.
If one is correct, time will tell.	Haddii mid ka mid ah uu sax yahay, wakhti ayaa sheegi doona.
It is not something I am.	Ma aha wax aan ahay.
They will love you.	Way ku jeclaan doonaan.
He would speak today.	Maanta wuu hadli lahaa.
Something terrible has happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa hadda dhacay.
I was ready for that.	diyaar ayaan u ahaa taas.
Just as it is.	Kaliya sida ay tahay.
Looks like you're in it	Waxay u egtahay inaad ku jirto
He no longer wanted to do that.	Mar dambe ma uu doonayn inuu taas sameeyo.
Everything else is kept.	Wax walba oo kale ayaa loo hayaa.
It certainly is.	Waa hubaal inay tahay.
Most do.	Inta badan waxay sameeyaan.
It will help me.	Way i caawin doontaa.
It's too big.	Aad buu u weyn yahay.
I refused.	Waan iska diiday.
I would do anything to get it.	Waxaan sameyn lahaa wax kasta si aan u helo.
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
A long time ago.	Waqti dheer ka hor.
It really was.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd.
I'm sure you will agree.	Waan hubaa inaad ogolaan doonto.
A little happened somewhere else.	Wax yar baa meel kale ka dhacay.
I can't see you today.	Maanta kuma arki karo .
I thought it would be better.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ka fiicnaan doono.
I'm sure that will happen.	Waxaan hubaa inay taasi dhici doonto.
He is better than us.	Isaga ayaa naga fiican.
They made no money.	Wax lacag ah ma ay samayn.
He always had something to do.	Mar walba wuxuu lahaa wax uu sameeyo.
I am very skeptical.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay.
I will do it again	mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa
But that will take time.	Laakiin taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
In fact, that was awful.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
That is free.	Taasi waa lacag la'aan.
But now there was no time.	Laakiin hadda waqti ma jirin.
You will talk.	Waad hadli doontaa.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
John was not present.	John ma joogin.
That being said may not be for everyone.	Taas marka la sheego waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan u ahayn qof walba.
Now, it will not happen.	Hadda, ma dhici doonto.
There is no one like him.	Qof la mid ah ma jiro.
I am very serious about that.	Aad ayaan uga dhab ahay taas.
Like people.	Sida dadka.
I saw it yesterday.	Shalay baan arkay.
One and only.	Hal iyo kaliya.
What a terrible place indeed.	Waa maxay meel aad u xun runtii.
No one else seemed to pick it up.	Ma jirin qof kale oo u muuqday inuu soo qaaday.
He wanted to leave.	Wuu rabay inuu baxo.
Now there was always something.	Hadda mar walba wax baa jiray.
I look happy and excited.	Waxaan u muuqdaa mid faraxsan oo faraxsan.
I can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karo.
Not surprisingly.	Ma aha yaab yaab leh.
I did not understand anything.	Waxba ma fahmin.
It was a very small day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u yar.
Really no one.	Runtii qofna ma leh.
I love how it looks now.	Waan jeclahay sida ay hadda u egtahay.
It would be so beautiful for me.	Waxay ii ahaan lahayd wax aad u qurux badan.
Not much here.	Ma badna halkan.
It's fast	Waa degdeg
But no problem.	Laakiin dhib ma lahayn.
I looked back.	Dib baan u eegay.
Everyone went home now.	Qof kastaa wuxuu aaday guriga hadda.
They are good friends.	Waa saaxiibo fiican.
Here is an opportunity	Halkan waa fursad
But he could not do much.	Laakiin wax badan ma uu qaban karin.
You are a tough person.	Waxaad tahay qof adag.
I know this is bad to know.	Waan ogahay in tani ay xun tahay in la ogaado.
I hear something almost every day.	Waxaan maqlay wax ku dhow maalin kasta.
He can see.	Wuu arki karaa.
He is definitely ready to come home.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu diyaar u yahay inuu guriga yimaado.
Pick it up and you will see why.	Soo qaado oo waad arki doontaa sababta.
It will be beautiful.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax qurux badan.
There is certainly a problem with what is going on.	Waxaa hubaal ah in dhibaato ay ka jirto waxa socda.
She didn't like it.	Ma ay jeclayn.
He would do it again.	Mar kale ayuu samayn lahaa.
And very happy too.	Oo aad u faraxsan sidoo kale.
A man with.	Nin leh.
You could not see	Ma aadan arki karin
I just don’t have another place to go.	Kaliya ma haysto meel kale oo aan aado.
You did everything right.	Wax walba si sax ah ayaad u samaysay.
I didn’t think this would just happen.	Uma malaynayn in tani ay dhici doonto oo kaliya.
I really don't know what to do.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
I should have.	Waxay ahayd inaan haysto.
He liked it.	Wuu ka helay.
I left, you know.	Waan ka tagay, waad ogtahay.
A little bad.	Wax yar oo xun.
And next.	Oo soo socda .
It's too big.	Way aad u weyn tahay.
Don't stop.	Ha 'joojin.
He looked at him.	Wuu eegay isaga.
Everything he said is enough.	Wax kasta oo uu sheegay ayaa ku filan.
I just want to be left alone.	Kaliya waxaan jeclahay in la iga tago.
It was a terrible place.	Waxay ahayd meel aad u xun.
I just don’t do this.	Kaliya tan ma samaynayo.
Here, there was nothing.	Halkan, waxba ma jirin.
It is great now.	Hadda waa weyn yahay.
They are very close to him.	Aad bay ugu jiraan isaga.
It will be beautiful.	Waxay noqon doontaa qurux.
Very long ago.	Aad u dheer ka hor.
You can do it if you want.	Waad samayn kartaa haddii aad rabto.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
There is no real food.	Ma jiro cunto dhab ah.
Maybe he is fine.	Malaha wuu fiican yahay.
It never happened.	Waligiis ma noqon.
But that is not true now.	Laakiin taasi hadda run maaha.
I think so.	Waxaan u malaynayaa.
And, he knew he had to do it quickly.	Oo, wuu ogaa inay tahay inuu si degdeg ah u sameeyo.
But he was having a difficult time.	Laakiin wuxuu ku jiray waqti adag.
That was the main thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ugu weyn.
But after that, there is nothing too difficult.	Laakiin tan ka dib, ma jiraan wax aad u adag.
That is too much.	Taasi waa mid aad u badan.
It was constant.	Waxay ahayd mid joogto ah.
He was a young man.	Nin yar buu ahaa.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
There was something else, too.	Wax kale ayaa jiray, sidoo kale.
He said he could not leave the scene immediately.	Wuxuu sheegay in uu si degdeg ah uga bixi waayay meesha.
You will be good friends.	Waxaad noqon doontaa saaxiibo fiican.
I know they will.	Waan ogahay inay yeeli doonaan.
It can only be a good thing.	Waxa kaliya oo ay noqon kartaa wax fiican.
Once upon a time.	Hal mar.
That is true.	Taas wuu ka dhab yahay.
One day there, the next day was gone.	Maalin halkaas ka mid ah, maalin dambe ayaa la tagay.
But it would not be me.	Laakiin aniga ma ahaan lahayd.
This was a given.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la siiyay.
No one is a friend.	Qofna saaxiib.
This was a great time.	Tani waxay ahayd waqti aad u badan.
I didn't tell him.	Uma sheegin.
I really doubt it.	Runtii waan ka shakisanahay.
you are amazing.	yaab baad tahay.
I decided to separate.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan kala tago.
That's how it was done.	Waa sida loo sameeyay.
He was a tough guy.	Wuxuu ahaa nin adag.
It can be very common in small doses.	Waxa uu aad ugu badan karaa in yar yar.
I was ready	diyaar baan ahaa
I have now been placed.	Hadda ayaa la ii dhigay.
They are smarter.	Way ka caqli badan yihiin.
I don't know him.	Ma garanayo isaga.
He has a long vision.	Arag dheer buu leeyahay.
It didn't matter what it was.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn waxa ay ahayd.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha mid adag.
You just can't go.	Kaliya ma aadi kartid.
It was so much, it was so much.	Waxay ahayd wax badan, waxay ahayd wax badan.
I don't see the former.	Uma arko mid hore.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
But he will not leave.	Laakiin ma bixi doono.
We can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban karno.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
There was only this.	Waxaa jiray tan kaliya.
She said so.	Waxay tidhi sidaas.
He took it seriously.	Si dhab ah ayuu u qaatay.
You can't stay here alone.	Halkan keligaa ma joogi kartid.
That is, perhaps, so far.	Taasi waa, laga yaabaa, ilaa hadda.
It may not be so short.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay ahayn muddo sidaas u yar.
I am not doing that now.	Hadda ma samaynayo taas.
She was a person like him.	Waxay ahayd qof isaga oo kale ah.
He wanted something he could do on his own.	Wuxuu rabay wax uu keligiis samayn karo.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
It's hard.	Waa mid adag .
You can do many other things.	Wax badan oo kale ayaad samayn kartaa.
She had no chance.	Wax fursad ah ma ay lahayn.
Fast forward three years later.	Si degdeg ah u socda saddex sano ka dib.
No one could stop him.	Qofna ma joojin karin.
You are really beautiful.	Runtii waad qurux badan tahay.
I got nothing from it.	Waxba waan ka helay.
There is nothing surprising.	Ma jiraan wax la yaab leh.
It just did nothing.	Kaliya waxba ma qaban.
I want to do more than see.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax ka badan inaan arko.
No one is coming.	Ma jiro qof u soo socda.
I will help you with everything.	Wax walba waan kaa caawin doonaa.
As before.	Sidii hore oo kale.
I have seen it many times.	Mar iyo jeer ayaan arkay.
This is urgent.	Tani waa mid degdeg ah.
He said he could pay.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu bixin karo.
It can't be right.	Sax ma noqon karto.
It's just here.	Kaliya waa halkaan.
This is again unnecessary.	Tani mar kale waa mid aan loo baahnayn.
We are the people.	Waxaan nahay dadka.
He did not return to the same person as he had left.	Uma soo noqon qof la mid ah kii uu tagay.
That would be like now.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd sida hadda.
what a friend.	maxaa saaxiib ah .
No one spoke at home.	Qofna kama uusan hadlin guriga.
Not everyone is like that.	Qof kastaa sidaas maaha.
And so every day.	Iyo sidaas oo kale maalin kasta.
He has to keep it somewhere else.	Waa inuu meel kale ku hayaa.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
Everyone is here, in the same place.	Qof kastaa waa halkan, isku meel.
I am really happy for you.	Runtii waan kugu faraxsanahay.
There was just surprise.	Waxaa jiray kaliya yaab.
He asked me to help.	Wuxuu iga codsaday inaan caawiyo.
You can leave at any time.	Waad iska bixi kartaa wakhti kasta.
Who did he spend time with when he was not with us?	Yaa uu waqti la qaatay mar aanu nala joogin.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I picked it up and parted.	Waan soo qaaday oo kala tagay.
He had to go now.	Waxay ahayd inuu hadda tago.
But you, well.	Laakiin adiga, si fiican.
It is true of everything new.	Waa run wax kasta oo cusub.
It is still too early to tell.	Wali waa goor hore in la sheego.
I really can't see how it can hurt.	Runtii ma arki karo sida ay wax u yeeli karto.
I can't do that again.	Taas mar kale ma samayn karo.
But it will be fine.	Laakiin way fiicnaan doontaa.
She should have known where he was.	Waxay ahayd inay ogaato meesha uu joogo.
I always win	Mar walba waan guulaysan
I stayed.	Waan iska joogay.
So far, no problem.	Ilaa hadda, dhib ma leh.
There is something else you have to do.	Waxaa jira wax kale oo ay tahay inaad sameyso.
You may want to do this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto inaad tan sameyso.
I can see that.	Waan arki karaa taas.
There is nothing really real.	Ma jiraan wax dhab ah oo dhab ah.
A man came in	Nin baa soo galay
I don't see that.	ma arko taas.
I will provide everything I need.	Waxaan bixin doonaa wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay.
This will be a lot more the same.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa wax badan oo isku mid ah.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
He tried everything.	Wax walba wuu isku dayay.
That is, no less.	Taasi waa, mar dambe ma yara.
But it can also be a bit of a hassle.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay noqon kartaa xoogaa dhib ah.
But they did nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma ay samayn.
But you did not do that.	Laakiin taas ma aadan samayn.
He could not see.	Wuu arki waayay.
And maybe.	Oo malaha .
Beautiful, but great.	Qurux badan, laakiin weyn.
Tell them everything.	Wax walba u sheeg.
I've heard it before, long ago.	Mar hore ayaan maqlay, waa hore ka hor.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
Let's do that first.	Marka hore aan samayno taas.
It's bad to do.	Way xun tahay in la sameeyo.
I have it now	hadda waan hayaa
He came in a little bit.	Wax yar buu halkan soo galay.
I hope they like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay jecel yihiin.
But it looks like.	Laakiin way u egtahay.
Not so good to do.	Aad uma fiican in la sameeyo.
Tonight would be over.	Caawa way dhammaan lahayd.
Now I don't understand anything.	Hadda waxba ma fahmin.
He was made to leave.	Waa laga dhigay inuu baxo.
Another man.	Nin kale.
That was the day before yesterday.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin ka hor shalay.
Sure, he wanted to be friends with her.	Hubaal, wuxuu rabay inuu saaxiib la noqdo.
I know I have to.	Waan ogahay in aan sameeyo.
Now that is not a good idea.	Hadda taasi maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
That can’t be too hard.	Taasi ma noqon karto mid aad u adag.
Maybe there is something he can do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax uu sameyn karo.
As always, we will see.	Sida had iyo jeer, waan arki doonaa.
That there is beauty.	In ay jirto qurux.
I was really new to him.	Runtii waxaan ahaa qof ku cusub isaga.
What does it look like ?.	Sidee u egtahay?.
Now he is surprised.	Hadda wuu yaabay.
You can come and stay with us.	Waad noo iman kartaa oo nala joogi kartaa.
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
It is still you.	Wali waa adiga.
I have not been there for a long time.	Ma aanan joogin halkaas waqti dheer.
If only she had done it.	Haddii kaliya ay samaysay.
He will come.	Wuu u iman doonaa.
Now that is good money.	Hadda taasi waa lacag fiican.
But someone else was there.	Laakiin qof kale ayaa joogay.
Now I can do that, you know.	Hadda waan samayn karaa taas, waad ogtahay.
It can be a lot.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax badan.
You know, you don't even have to do this.	Waad ogtahay, xitaa uma baahnid inaad tan sameyso.
He is still in prison.	Wali xabsiga ayuu ku jiraa.
That was taken from me.	Taas waa la iga qaatay.
I'm sure it will happen.	Waan hubaa inay dhici doonto.
The new door was beautiful.	Albaabka cusub wuxuu ahaa mid qurux badan.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
I guess he told me.	Waxaan filayaa inuu igu yidhi.
I think that's really the thing.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi runtii tahay wax.
He did not want to do that.	Ma uusan rabin inuu sidaas sameeyo.
When you.	Marka aad .
No one would help me.	Qofna ima caawin lahaa.
I hope we can do it again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale sameyn karno mar kale.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ahayn.
you are real.	dhab baad tahay.
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
It's a problem.	Waa dhib.
It’s just not too big.	Kaliya maaha mid aad u weyn.
That's not a big deal.	Taasi wax weyn maaha.
I decided that.	Taas ayaan go'aansaday.
What to do.	Muxuu samayn lahaa.
I will not return.	Soo noqon maayo.
A little now.	Wax yar hadda.
There is no certainty.	Wax hubaal ah ma jiro.
It will be a continuation of everything.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax sii socda oo dhan.
That is what it means to me.	Taasi waa waxa ay aniga ila tahay.
This includes you.	Tan waxaa ku jira adiga.
To speak.	Si loo hadlo.
This would happen very quickly.	Tani waxay u dhici lahayd si degdeg ah.
I always thought everyone knew this.	Waxaan had iyo jeer u maleynayay in qof kastaa uu tan ogaa.
We need more of that.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo taas ah.
I can barely see it here.	Si dhib ah ayaan halkan uga arki karaa.
That is who you really are.	Taasi waa qofka aad dhab ahaantii tahay.
He just took a job.	Kaliya shaqo ayuu qaatay.
Good strike.	Shaqo joojin wanaagsan.
I want to do it all.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo dhammaan.
That is, if you are lucky.	Taasi waa, haddii aad nasiib leedahay.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
Probably, nothing else.	Malaha, wax kale.
But it is a problem.	Laakiin waa dhibaato.
It will be a small task for you.	Waxay kuu noqon doontaa shaqo yar.
I really like him.	Runtii waan jeclahay isaga.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
I can't do what you do.	Ma sameyn karo waxaad sameyso.
This is what you have to do.	Tani waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
He may need time, too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu u baahan yahay waqti, sidoo kale.
It was probably right to leave after all.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sax ahayd inuu baxo ka dib oo dhan.
What? 	Maxay?
I dont understand.	Maan fahmin.
Please do not want.	Fadlan ha rabin.
It's me and you.	Waa aniga iyo adiga.
I really want you	aad baan kuu rabaa
I didn't know that until later.	Taas maan ogeyn ilaa markii dambe.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay.
He was an amazing man.	Nin yaab leh buu ahaa.
I love everything he does.	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta oo uu sameeyo.
He went to the back room.	Qolka dambe ayuu aaday.
I haven't found a place yet.	Weli meel maan helin.
Then, he said.	Ka dib, wuxuu yidhi.
I think that could be better.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiicnaan karto.
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
They are happy with nothing.	Waxba way ku faraxsan yihiin.
It was not too bad.	Wax aad u xun ma ahayn.
They are close.	Way isku dhow yihiin.
I hope this is not the case.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani aysan sidaas ahayn.
He may have seen better what happened.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu si fiican u arkay wixii dhacay.
Have a little.	Wax yar qabo.
They are the same.	Waxay la mid yihiin.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
You said that was enough for you now.	Waxaad sheegtay in kugu filan hadda.
He knows everything there is to know.	Wuu garanayaa wax kasta oo jira inuu ogaado.
He felt surprised.	Yaab buu dareemay.
I would take it back	dib ayaan u qaadan lahaa
That would do.	Taasi way samayn lahayd.
I was really surprised.	Runtii aad baan ula yaabay.
I think the same can be said of people.	Waxaan filayaa in sidaas oo kale laga odhan karo dadka.
But she refused.	Laakiin way diiday.
He could not say exactly why.	Si sax ah uma uu sheegi karin sababta.
But today it was unbelievable.	Laakiin maanta waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
And really, it was.	Oo runtii, waxay ahayd.
He saw everything.	Wax walba wuu arkay.
It's gone, just like that.	Waa tagay, sidaas oo kale.
I saw that.	Waan arkay taas.
You this too.	Adiga tan sidoo kale.
I hope to go	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan tago
She refused to do so.	Way diiday inay sidaas samayso.
I want more.	Waxaan rabaa waxyaabo badan.
Also once at home.	Sidoo kale hal mar guriga.
I saw nothing else.	Wax kale ma arag.
He has done everything he can now.	Waxa uu sameeyay wax kasta oo uu awoodo hadda.
That is why they are happy.	Taasi waa sababta ay u faraxsan yihiin.
That is what you have to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
I'm happy to be here.	Waxaan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
They could not allow themselves to do so.	Uma ogolaan karin inay sidaas sameeyaan.
I'm in now	Hadda ayaan galay
There was no time to tell him.	Ma jirin wakhti isaga loo sheego.
That's right.	Taas oo sax ah.
It is very common in the home.	Aad bay ugu badan tahay guriga.
I have never been like that.	Weligay sidaas ma aan noqon.
No one found it.	Qofna ma helin.
Now, as close as possible.	Hadda, inta kuu dhow.
This is where most of us live.	Tani waa halka in badan oo naga mid ah ay ku nool yihiin.
They are small.	Way yar yihiin.
It's a terrible thing.	Waa wax aad u xun.
He really loves school.	Runtii wuu jecel yahay dugsiga.
I am older.	Aniga ayaa ka weyn.
He may not have been in the same place for a long time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan isku meel joogin muddo dheer.
He is an amazing man.	Waa nin la yaab leh.
Something bad happened.	Wax xun baa dhacay.
Probably not.	Malaha maaha.
Greatly good.	Si weyn ayaa u fiican.
A lot is out of it.	Wax badan ayaa ka baxay.
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
But don't have three.	Laakiin ha haysan saddex.
A real problem.	Dhibaato dhab ah.
It was very interesting, really.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan, dhab ahaantii.
There was no one else.	Qof kale ma jirin.
Not much will be seen.	Wax badan la arki maayo.
There was nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo aan aado ma jirin.
It is uncertain whether he will do so.	In uu taas samayn doono lama hubo.
Mary is like that.	Maryan waa sidaas oo kale.
I just, really.	Waxaan kaliya, runtii.
I really can’t say, for sure.	Runtii ma odhan karo, hubaal.
Most of the time, there is no time.	Inta badan, ma jiro waqti.
I know you want to.	Waan ogahay inaad rabto.
I got it all.	Waan wada helay.
It's good, you know.	Way fiican tahay, waad ogtahay.
There is so much she can do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo ay sameyn karto.
I think that's right.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi sax tahay.
Now it was home.	Hadda waxay ahayd guriga.
Still, you will find the truth.	Weli, waxaad heli doontaa run.
Take me now.	Hadda ii qaado.
Also take a little.	Sidoo kale qaado wax yar.
I need to work on this.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka shaqeeyo arrintan.
How good yet.	Sidee u fiican weli.
This really can't happen.	Runtii tani ma dhici karto.
But you wouldn’t give it a chance.	Laakiin ma aad siin lahayd fursad.
It couldn't hurt me.	Waxba ima yeeli karin.
But there must be other things.	Laakiin waa inay jiraan waxyaabo kale.
Otherwise, no one will pay.	Haddii kale, qofna ma bixin doono.
I wanted to do something to help.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax aan ku caawiyo.
That can probably be done.	Taasi malaha waa la samayn karaa.
I did not come here to cause trouble.	Halkan uma iman inaan dhibaato sameeyo.
To this day I do not know.	Ilaa maanta ma garanayo.
He must leave.	Waa inuu ka tago.
That's what he does.	Waa waxa uu sameeyo.
They are so obvious that they really cannot be seen.	Way cad yihiin oo dhab ahaantii lama arki karo.
I can see it from all angles.	Waxaan ka arki karaa dhan walba.
Here it is, he said to himself.	Waa tan, ayuu is yidhi.
It is the best thing he can do.	Waa waxa ugu fiican ee uu samayn karo.
Much is needed.	Wax badan baa loo baahan yahay.
Maybe more than enough.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan oo ku filan.
A long time ago.	Muddo dheer ka hor.
It just can’t happen.	Kaliya ma dhici karto.
She was the next man.	Waxay ahayd nin soo socda.
I know they are always so beautiful.	Waan ogahay in ay had iyo jeer aad u qurux badan yihiin.
They did not stop.	Ma ay joojin.
All in all, have a nice day.	Dhammaan, maalin wanaagsan.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
This is even better.	Tani way ka sii fiican tahay.
you are amazing.	yaab baad tahay.
But he could not do anything.	Laakiin waxba ma uu qaban karin.
Everyone wants that.	Qof kastaa wuu rabaa taas.
He said I would go out with him.	Wuxuu yidhi waan la bixi doonaa.
I would say nothing.	waxba ma odhan lahaa.
There is nothing constant that is not known.	Ma jiraan wax joogto ah oo aan la garanayn.
That is not true of anything else.	Taasi run maaha wax kale.
Great one.	Mid weyn.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo taas.
No one did that, either.	Qofna taas ma samayn, sidoo kale.
It's been a long time.	Waa muddo dheer.
This looks like a lot.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid la mid ah.
It was very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan.
And all for nothing.	Oo dhammaan waxba.
I love it there, too.	Waan jeclahay halkaas, sidoo kale.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Maybe not today, but another day.	Malaha maanta maaha, laakiin maalin kale.
Everyone needs one.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u baahan yahay mid.
It is difficult to say whether this is true or not.	In taasi run tahay iyo in kale way adag tahay in la sheego.
But it is so much more.	Laakiin waa wax aad u badan.
Usually only one.	Inta badan hal kaliya.
This is correct.	Tani waa mid sax ah.
I love the place	waan jeclahay meesha
It has something to do with you.	Wax dhib kugu ah ayuu ku leeyahay.
No one knew who they were.	Qofna ma garanayn cidda ay yihiin.
Now, tell me.	Hadda, ii sheeg.
That is what needs to be done.	Taasi waa waxa la rabo in la sameeyo.
Something new.	Wax iyo meel cusub.
There is nothing close.	Ma jiraan wax u dhow.
you can't come to me.	igama iman kartid.
I'm right	sax ayaan joogaa
And they are very good.	Oo aad bay u fiican yihiin.
It was just great.	Kaliya waxay ahayd mid weyn.
Not bad.	Mid xun maaha.
But even that wasn’t a big deal.	Laakiin xitaa taasi wax weyn ma ahayn.
But here it is still a bit of a problem.	Laakiin halkan weli waa xoogaa dhibaato ah.
That is what they are for.	Taasi waa waxa ay u yihiin.
It could be anyone here.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta halkan.
Probably too.	Malaha sidoo kale.
far from me	iga dheer
This can be good.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan.
She had to tell him.	Waxay ahayd inuu u sheego.
It really doesn't matter.	Runtii waxba maaha.
And that he will be back soon.	Iyo in uu dhawaan soo noqon doono.
I have no idea that.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo taas.
Otherwise I would not be here.	Haddii kale halkan ma joogi lahaa.
Certainly not.	Run ahaantii maaha.
He had to get out of this.	Waxay ahayd inuu ka baxo arrintan.
You can still get money with us.	Weli lacag ayaad nala heli kartaa.
He did not come from anywhere else.	Meel kale kama iman.
I did nothing.	Anigu waxba maan samayn.
That is how it should be done.	Waa sidaas in la sameeyo.
There was no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn.
No one else.	Ma jiro qof kale.
I can be whatever you want me to be.	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta oo aad rabto inaan noqdo.
It really is a great place.	Runtii waa meel aad u fiican .
That was interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
She said for sure.	Waxay tidhi hubaal.
I am still at work	Weli shaqada ayaan ku jiraa
You are who you are.	Waxaad tahay qofka aad tahay.
Now everyone loves it.	Hadda qof walba wuu jecel yahay.
Three are gone.	Saddex ayaa tagay.
Everyone knows me.	Qof walba waa i yaqaan.
It is where she needs to be.	Waa meesha ay u baahan tahay.
I have never seen him.	Weligay ma arag isaga.
He is sure.	Wuu hubaa.
It is not money.	Lacag maaha.
This was not correct.	Tani sax ma ahayn.
You can't do this in person.	Uma samayn kartid tan qofka.
There was something in it.	Wax baa ku jiray.
Not often.	Inta badan maaha.
Each of us.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah.
Really, I really am.	Runtii, runtii waan ahay.
That is the best way.	Taasi waa sida ugu fiican.
We will do something about it.	Waanu wax ka qaban doonaa.
He was not there.	Halkaas ma uu joogin.
No one is talking.	Qofna lama hadlo.
Still, near work, there was nothing better.	Weli, shaqada dhow, ma jirin wax ka fiican.
No luck today.	Nasiib ma leh maanta.
I still don't know if we can do it.	Wali ma garanayo in aan samayn karno.
I will help myself.	Waan is caawin doonaa.
He was a tall white man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin cad oo dheer.
I saw it today.	Maanta ayaan arkay.
What I do not know at first.	Waxaan sameeyo ma garanayo markii hore.
I didn’t know she could do that.	Maan garanayn inay taas samayn karto.
You can always find one near you.	Mar walba waxaad heli kartaa mid kuu dhow.
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
I wonder if he has a friend.	Waxaan la yaabanahay in uu saaxiib leeyahay.
Bad job bad.	Shaqo xun oo xun.
That is what it is.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay.
We can't give that away.	Ma siin karno taas.
It was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan, aad u qurux badan.
That's not it, please don't be that way! 	Taas ma aha, fadlan taasi ha noqon!
.	.
I refused that.	Taas waan diiday.
I got enough	Waxaan helay ku filan
Something needs to be done urgently.	Wax loo baahan yahay in si degdeg ah loo sameeyo.
I know what.	Waan ogahay waxa.
That’s what we do here, after all.	Taasi waa waxa aan halkan ku samayno, ka dib oo dhan.
Today, that is no longer the case.	Maanta, taasi hadda ma jirto.
It’s so much more now.	Waa wax aad u badan hadda.
But nothing is said '.	Laakiin ma jiro wax la sheego'.
I know you have.	Waan ogahay inaad leedahay.
Now, that was amazing.	Hadda, taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
Maybe for a while.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in muddo ah.
Something terrible is going to happen here.	Halkan wax aad u xun ayaa ka dhici doona.
It is well and clearly.	Waa si fiican oo cad.
I'm surprised you're here.	Waxaan la yaabay inaad halkan joogto.
He saw her everywhere.	Meel walba oo ay ku jirto ayuu ku arkay.
All in all it was great.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
Probably no one will.	Malaha qofna ma yeeli doono.
I got time.	Waqti ayaan helay.
That's all, and no problem.	Taasi waa dhan, oo wax dhib ah maaha.
I will not lie to you again.	Been dambe kuu sheegi maayo.
But it is also a problem.	Laakiin sidoo kale waa dhib.
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax weyn.
What to do now?	Hadda maxaa la sameeyaa?.
She did not speak to him.	Ma aysan la hadlin.
It felt long	Waxa la dareemay dheer
But that's not so bad.	Laakiin taasi maaha wax sidaas u xun.
That is good to know.	Taasi waa wax fiican in la ogaado.
I can't get that, yet.	Taas ma heli karo, weli.
He is a very bad man.	Waa nin aad u xun.
It was really, really hard.	Waxay ahayd runtii, runtii adag.
I can't speak.	Ma hadli karo.
Everything he has done is not surprising.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyay maaha wax la yaab leh.
He must learn quickly.	Waa in uu si degdeg ah wax u barto.
It looks like he got it right.	Waxay u egtahay inuu mid sax ah helay.
I can't do anything.	waxba ma samayn karo.
He would be a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaan lahaa.
They are more, now, more than ever.	Way ka sii badan yihiin, hadda, in ka badan sidii hore.
I didn’t, you know.	Maan samayn, waad ogtahay.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
I will be ready	diyaar ayaan noqon doonaa
As long as we do.	Ilaa iyo inta aan samayno.
Both are very good.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin.
It needs to be talked about.	Waxay u baahan tahay in laga hadlo.
I did not return.	Kuma soo noqon.
I did not help.	Maan caawin.
Tomorrow, it will be a better day.	Berrito, waxay ahaan doontaa maalin ka wanaagsan.
That was the same, too.	Taasi waxay ahayd isku mid, sidoo kale.
It is too good to be true.	Aad buu u fiican yahay inuu run noqdo.
They do what they do.	Waxay sameeyaan waxay sameeyaan.
What happened is this.	Maxaa dhacay waa kan.
Maybe another time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waqti kale.
Where this is.	Halka ay tani .
she did not return.	kuma ay soo noqon.
All very interesting.	Dhammaan aad u xiiso badan.
They may not be back yet.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan weli soo wada noqon.
That's how bad they are.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun yihiin.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
That is nonsense.	Taasi waa wax aan jirin.
But it is the only thing we can do.	Laakiin waa waxa kaliya ee aan sameyn karno.
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
Everyone looked.	Qof kastaa wuu eegay.
But they are instant friends.	Laakiin waa saaxiibo degdeg ah.
It may have been seen.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in la arkay.
I get no money	Wax lacag ah ma helo
You know they exist.	Waad ogtahay inay jiraan.
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
But this was not all.	Laakiin tani ma ahayn dhammaan.
I didn't get any work.	Aan helin wax shaqo ah.
Probably not yet.	Malaha ilaa hadda.
I don't want to talk about him anymore.	Ma doonayo inaan mar dambe ka hadlo isaga.
She is always happy.	Had iyo jeer way ku faraxsan tahay.
I haven't seen him in much time.	In badan maan arag isaga.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad u qurux badan tahay.
She should have been with us.	Waxay ahayd inay nala jirto.
This is very real and very fast.	Tani waa mid dhab ah oo aad u degdeg ah.
It was not another.	Mid kale ma ahayn.
you don't want me here.	halkan ima rabto.
What you did was beautiful and accurate.	Waxa aad samaysay waxa ay ahayd mid qurux badan oo sax ah.
It was very good.	Waxa ay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I wanted him to do it.	Waxaan rabay inuu sameeyo.
Maybe he was still.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli ahaa.
We can no longer help.	Mar dambe kuma caawin karno.
Not a little.	Wax yar maaha.
is correct.	waa sax .
Certainly not right here.	Wax hubaal ah halkan kuma sax ahayn.
Very well laid out.	Aad u fiican ayaa loo dhigay.
Now is a good time.	Hadda waa wakhti fiican.
And what a day it was.	Oo maxaa maalin ahayd.
She said she has.	Waxay sheegtay inay leedahay.
So far it is not here.	Ilaa hadda halkan kuma jirto.
Just me.	Kaliya aniga oo aniga ah.
Maybe a day.	Malaha maalin.
I will always do, really.	Had iyo jeer waan sameyn doonaa, dhab ahaantii.
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
I did not know who.	Maan garanayn cidda.
I am nothing.	Anigu waxba kama ihi.
That is clearly not true.	Taasi si cad maaha run.
Amazing !.	Yaab badan!.
Now, this is a very small place.	Hadda, tani waa meel aad u yar.
But if he did.	Laakiin haddii uu sameeyay.
There is just so much space.	Waxaa jira meel aad u badan oo kaliya.
He had.	Wuu lahaa.
I wanted him to say something, everything.	Waxaan rabay inuu wax sheego, wax kasta.
I love that, beautifully.	Waan jeclahay taas, qurux ahaan.
There is something terrible.	Waxaa jira wax aad u xun.
I think it's a very bad idea.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay fikrad aad u xun.
There may be many things to do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in lagu sameeyo waxyaabo badan.
I must not pay you.	Waa inaanan lacag ku siin.
Now he loves it.	Hadda waa uu jecel yahay.
If it is true, it is a friend.	Haddii uu run yahay, waa saaxiib.
As of now.	Sida hadda oo kale.
You can get it if you want.	Waad heli kartaa haddii aad rabto.
Like, very little.	Sida, aad u yar.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
As they were supposed to do.	Sida ay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
Tell them what you said every day.	Maalin kasta u sheeg waxa aad sheegtay.
Wise money should leave.	Lacag caqli leh waa inuu ka tago.
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
I have to do that.	Waa inaan taas sameeyaa.
It is expected.	Waa la filayaa.
Indeed, it is.	Runtii, waa.
You are alone.	Waxaad tahay keligaa.
He had no one.	Cidna ma uu lahayn.
I have no idea why she is even there.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sababta ay xitaa halkaas u joogto.
Going to prison is bad.	In xabsiga la aado ayaa xun.
That will do.	Taasi way sameyn doontaa.
I have never been there.	Weligay ma aanan joogin.
And very little else.	Iyo wax kale oo aad u yar.
It's hard for him.	Way ku adag tahay isaga.
I expect so, and I hope so.	Waxaan filayaa sidaas, oo waxaan rajeynayaa.
Amazing things, really.	Waxyaabo yaab leh, runtii.
This is also not true.	Tani sidoo kale run maaha.
I love doing that.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan taas sameeyo.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
We can't stay here right now.	Halkan hadda kuma joogi karno.
It's too bad.	Aad baa u xun.
I think like this.	Waxaan u maleynayaa sida tan.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
And many other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale oo badan.
I really hope they are not.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan ahayn.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
Tell them you don't know what it is.	U sheeg inaadan garanayn waxa ay tahay.
He is a very good person.	Waa qof aad u wanaagsan.
I want to know more about it.	Waxaan rabaa in aan wax badan ka ogaado.
I am not true.	Aniga run maaha.
I spent a lot of time on this.	Waqti badan ayaan ku qaatay arrintan.
There is something you do	Waxaa jira wax aad sameyso
That was what he did.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa sameeyay.
But this is up there.	Laakiin tani waa ilaa halkaas.
You must not cook anything	Waa inaadan waxba karin
I'm sure it will be.	Waan hubaa inay ahaan doonto.
No three people came.	Saddex qofna uma iman.
Now we are.	Hadda sidaas ayaan nahay.
But that is too late.	Laakiin taasi waa dambe.
We will see each other.	Waan is arki doonaa.
He did not have time.	Ma uusan haysan waqti.
They need it.	Way u baahan yihiin.
I am always happy to see.	Had iyo jeer waan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko.
She had to go to work.	Waxay ahayd in ay shaqo aado.
What he found was surprising.	Wixii uu helay ayaa la yaabay.
They are difficult.	Way ku adag yihiin.
He looked bad.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid xun.
We just need a little time.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay waqti yar.
He looked like a sure man.	Waxa uu u muuqday nin la hubo.
It was a good work day.	Waxay ahayd maalin shaqo wanaagsan.
Always a new one.	Had iyo jeer mid cusub.
No problem, yet.	Dhibaato ma jiraan, weli.
That was unthinkable.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan la malayn karin.
There was not enough time.	Ma jirin waqti ku filan.
It just can’t be.	Kaliya ma noqon karto.
I think you are a good man.	Waxaan filayaa inaad tahay nin wanaagsan.
I must.	waa inaan.
But he was not yet ready to tell her.	Laakiin weli diyaar uma ahayn inuu u sheego.
What he did made us bad.	Waxa uu sameeyay ayaa naga dhigay mid xun.
He thought it was beautiful.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in ay tahay mid qurux badan.
It doesn’t take much else.	Wax badan oo kale ma qaado.
I will not lie to you.	Been kuu sheegi maayo.
I never saw him again.	Weligay ma arag goor dambe.
I am with you	waan kula jiraa
Why you are here	Sababta aad halkan u joogto
It never came out.	Waligiis lama soo bixin.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
This was also new.	Tani sidoo kale waxay ahayd mid cusub.
He is always bigger than anyone else.	Had iyo jeer wuu ka weyn yahay qof kasta oo kale.
He got a lot of time to go.	Waxa uu helay wakhti badan oo uu ku baxo.
Bad place.	Meel xun.
No one saw him.	Cidna ma uu arag.
I did not leave him.	Maan ka tagin isaga.
I am a bad man.	nin xun baan ahay.
He wants me to tell him.	Wuxuu rabaa inaan u sheego.
It wasn’t a lot of fun.	Ma ahayn wax xiiso badan.
He would be right, as always.	Wuxuu noqon lahaa sax, sida had iyo jeer.
But not too much.	Laakiin aad uma badna.
That's enough.	Taas oo ku filan.
I need a lot more like you.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan oo adiga oo kale ah.
Very interesting.	Aad u xiiso badan.
There is no such thing.	Wax isku mid ah ma jiraan.
He is here to help.	Wuxuu halkan u joogaa inuu caawiyo.
I do a lot of the same.	Waxaan sameeyaa wax badan oo la mid ah.
Tonight, if you will.	Caawa, haddii aad rabto.
She will love this one.	Way jeclaan doontaa kan.
Only found back	Kaliya dib ayaa lagu helay
Very, very good job.	Shaqo aad iyo aad u fiican.
Everything needed.	Wax kasta oo loo baahan yahay.
Like, tomorrow, even.	Sida, berri, xitaa.
Very little.	Runtii aad u yar.
Do not talk to anyone.	Qofna ha la hadlin.
It may still be.	Wali waa laga yaabaa.
I can't find the place.	Ma heli karo meesha.
I don't see much trouble here.	Dhib badan kuma arko halkan.
Not to return.	Inaan soo noqon.
But he doesn't seem to be happy.	Laakiin uma eka inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
The more surprising the better.	Inta ka sii yaab badan ayaa fiican.
Very nice, very happy.	Aad u fiican, aad u faraxsan.
You can leave now	Hadda waad bixi kartaa
I hope more will come.	Waxaan filayaa in wax badan ay iman doonaan.
A few things.	Waxyaabo dhowr ah.
That would really help us.	Taasi runtii way na caawin lahayd.
He is more.	Isaga ayaa ka badan.
I really want to do a lot of things	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo badan
Surely someone knows.	Hubaal in qof wax garanayo.
I want to go there as well.	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado halkaas sidoo kale.
But it is great.	Laakiin waa mid weyn.
She is very smart, she is very beautiful.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay, aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Now he is back for us.	Hadda wuu nagu soo noqday.
Do not talk to anyone.	Cidna ha la hadlin.
That probably is.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay.
Some solid food.	Cunto xoogaa adag.
But it is very difficult.	Laakiin aad bay u adag tahay.
It was still new.	Weli waxay ahayd mid cusub.
That is all that is now.	Taasi waa waxa hadda jira oo dhan.
I owe you	waan kugu leeyahay
Maybe you can do something about it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad wax ka qaban karto.
Better than it was.	Si ka wanaagsan sidii ay ahayd.
There is a lot going on about this.	Wax badan ayaa ka socda arrintan.
There is nothing harder than this.	Ma jiraan wax ka adag tan.
It was unbelievable.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
Maybe you can help me with that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad taas iga caawin karto.
And not much money.	Oo aan lacag badan ahayn.
Now you say.	Hadda waad sheegtay.
I would do the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan yeeli lahaa.
He lives here.	Halkan ayuu ku nool yahay.
I will not always be there.	Mar walba halkaas ma joogi doono.
But more is needed.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa loo baahan yahay.
As he knew it would happen.	Sida uu ogaa inay dhici doonto.
There are no real friends.	Ma jiro saaxiibo dhab ah.
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
They are rare.	Way ku yar yihiin.
He did not get it.	Ma uu helin.
He will be with us soon.	Dhawaan ayuu nala joogi doonaa.
I really didn’t want to.	Dhab ahaantii ma aanan rabin.
Upcoming.	Ku soo socda.
She can't talk.	Ma hadli karto.
But once, a long time ago.	Laakiin hal mar, wakhti dheer ka hor.
It may be correct.	Wuxuu noqon karaa mid sax ah.
This he wanted to keep surprised until later.	Tan waxa uu rabay in uu la yaab ku hayo ilaa goor dambe.
I think it could be so good.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas ku fiicnaan karto.
You can tell.	Waad sheegi kartaa.
It was very busy.	Waxay ahayd mid aad mashquul u ah.
Maybe it was always time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay mar walba ahayd waqti.
I look forward to seeing you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko.
I have no idea what to do.	Wax aan sameeyo wax fikrad ah uma hayo.
It is like being in prison.	Waxay la mid tahay in xabsiga lagu jiro.
I don't think so.	U malayn maayo.
She is happy and well.	Way faraxsan tahay oo way fiican tahay.
But it was nothing.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax aan waxba ahayn.
This was someone else.	Tani waxay ahayd qof kale.
And maybe he told me.	Oo malaha wuxuu igu yidhi.
I have no idea if she likes it or not.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay jeceshahay iyo in kale.
It’s a lot of other things.	Waa waxyaabo kale oo badan.
I don't like that very much.	Aad uma jecli taas.
I did that and more.	Taas iyo wax ka badan ayaan sameeyay.
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
I like it a lot	wax badan ayaan jeclahay
Bad job.	Shaqo xun.
Sure, I should.	Hubaal, waa inaan.
It was not.	Ma ahayn.
He felt he had that.	Wuxuu dareemay in uu taas ku leeyahay.
Nothing came out.	Wax soo baxay ma jiraan.
Unless you are one of us.	Haddii aadan naga mid ahayn ma jiraan.
It really is a good idea.	Runtii waa fikrad wanaagsan.
Maybe I know better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan si fiican u garanayo.
I will stop again one day.	Mar kale ayaan joojin doonaa maalin.
Including this.	Oo ay ku jirto kan.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
And it doesn't look very good anymore.	Oo uma eka mid aad u wanaagsan mar dambe.
Not until you tell me.	Ma aha ilaa aad ii sheegto.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
But it is a good idea.	Laakiin waa fikrad fiican.
I think it is not.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in aysan ahayn.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay .
That was spread.	Taas waa la kala qaaday.
It was done in good time.	Waxaa la sameeyay waqti fiican.
I wanted to learn from it.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax ka barto.
We will see that they are happy.	Waxaan arki doonaa in ay ku faraxsan yihiin.
He will tell you how to do it !.	Wuxuu kuu sheegi doonaa sida loo sameeyo!.
I looked back at him.	Waxaan dib u eegay isaga.
He still wanted to.	Weli wuu rabay.
We cannot allow this.	Ma ogolaan karno tan.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
This can take up to three years.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa ilaa saddex sano.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
Not much, he thought.	Ma badna, ayuu is yidhi.
I don’t even want to be another one.	Xitaa ma rabo inaan noqdo mid kale.
But it will be over soon.	Laakiin mar dhow way dhammaan doontaa.
I was there several times.	Dhowr jeer ayaa halkaas joogay.
There was something else as well.	Wax kale ayaa jiray sidoo kale.
It can be very real, very fast.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid dhab ah oo dhab ah, oo degdeg ah.
He is alive.	Waa nool yahay.
But the job was hard to find.	Laakiin shaqada ayaa ahayd mid adag in la helo.
It was a given.	Waxay ahayd wax la siiyay.
But he saw nothing of this.	Laakiin waxba kama uu arag arrintan.
So did everyone else.	Sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale lahaa.
I said nothing.	Ma odhan waxba.
I do not understand why this.	Ma fahmin sababta tan.
He will speak soon.	Dhawaan ayaa hadli doona.
Only one did.	Mid kaliya ayaa sameeyay.
I don't want to eat.	Ma rabo in la cuno.
I couldn’t see how real it could be.	Maan arki karin sida uu dhab u noqon karo.
Don't tell me anything.	Waxba ha ii sheegin.
I am a lucky person.	Waxaan ahay qof nasiib leh.
He knew very well.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
Someone knows something.	Qof baa wax yaqaan.
To do this requires hard work.	Si taas loo sameeyo waxay u baahan tahay shaqo adag.
There is a lot going on.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo socda.
Here, it is the place.	Halkan, waa meesha.
Now I come back to talk to him.	Hadda ayaan u soo noqday si aan ula hadlo.
I don’t understand how you don’t understand that.	Ma fahmin sida aadan taas u fahmin.
But this is good for me.	Laakiin tani way igu fiican tahay aniga.
Maybe I would	Malaha waan sameyn lahaa
I can't stop that.	Ma joojin karo taas.
He became a good friend.	Wuxuu noqday saaxiib wanaagsan.
They do it all the time bad.	Waxay sameeyaan mar kasta oo xun.
That's when he came to me.	Waa markii uu ii yimid.
She really promised she would stop.	Runtii waxay ballan qaaday inay joojin doonto.
I have no idea what it is.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxa ay tahay.
Everyone knows someone who knows.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa qof yaqaan.
It's work.	Waa shaqo.
It is very good that he has come so far.	Aad bay u fiican tahay inuu ilaa hadda yimid.
It was exactly as it was.	Waxay ahayd run ahaantii sida ay ahayd.
He appeared.	Wuxuu u muuqday .
I will do everything.	Wax walba waan sameyn doonaa.
No more cars	Baabuur dambe ma iman
It says no.	Waxay leedahay ma jiraan.
You should not say so.	Waa inaadan sidaas u hadlin.
I have never said anything like that.	Weligay wax sidaas oo kale ah uma odhan.
I had a good time tonight.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican caawa.
It can't be real.	Ma uu noqon karo dhab.
But it is not a big deal.	Laakiin wax weyn maaha.
Not to mention a little.	Ma aha in la sheego wax yar.
All may be enough.	Dhammaan waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku filan yihiin.
But he wanted more.	Laakiin wax badan ayuu rabay.
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
It is not a lie.	Been ma aha.
He can see everything from where he is.	Meesha uu joogo ayuu wax walba ka arki karaa.
But there was nothing exciting.	Laakiin ma jirin wax xiiso badan.
It was as she knew it would be.	Waxay ahayd sidii ay ogaatay inay ahaan doonto.
Others.	Dadka kale.
It was something, a real beauty.	Waxay ahayd wax, qurux dhab ah.
But you can't get everything.	Laakiin wax walba ma heli kartid.
Everyone seemed to like me.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqday inuu i jecel yahay.
There was nowhere.	Meel ma jirin.
No one likes that.	Qofna sidaas ma jecla.
I clearly say this.	Si cad ayaan tan u leeyahay.
Let me get you that.	Aan kuu helo taas.
She had a new job.	Waxay lahayd shaqo cusub.
He loves you.	Wuu ku jecel yahay.
That should do them, he thought.	Taasi waa inay sameeyaan, ayuu u maleeyay.
That is so far here.	Taasi waa ilaa hadda halkan.
There is something big going on.	Waxaa jira wax weyn oo socda.
But it could be better.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa si fiican.
I think you are a very busy person.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad tahay qof mashquul badan.
I am old.	Waxaan ahay hore.
I'm sorry for you.	Waan ka xumahay adiga.
I didn’t have anyone else.	Maan haysan qof kale.
That's really it.	Runtii taasi waa taas.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
You can do that, too.	Waad samayn kartaa taas, sidoo kale.
I don't know, but maybe you can.	Ma garanayo, laakiin malaha waad samayn kartaa.
Beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan.
He was one, too.	Mid buu ahaa, sidoo kale.
And a bad place.	Iyo meel xun.
Good things have happened here.	Waxyaabo wanaagsan ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
I lost one big enough for me.	Waxaan waayay mid weyn oo igu filan.
It doesn't look like you can find it anywhere.	Uma eka inaad ka heli karto meel kasta oo laga iibsado.
But he has to work on it.	Laakiin waa inuu ka shaqeeyo.
Nothing is right.	Waxba sax ma aha.
We were not.	Waxaan ahayn.
I never took anything.	Weligay waxba maan qaadan.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii waa qurux.
Nothing good so far.	Wax fiican maaha ilaa hadda.
It looks real.	Waxay u egtahay mid dhab ah.
There is not much.	Wax aad u badan ma jiraan.
I can't take much	Wax badan ma qaadan karo
i love you so much	waan ku jeclahay sidaas
Everyone got it.	Qof kastaa wuu helay.
She was unable to help herself.	Way awoodi wayday inay is caawiso.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
No one could see it.	Qofna ma arki karin.
And I didn't need to.	Oo uma baahnayn.
Several things came from this.	Waxyaabo dhowr ah ayaa tan ka yimid.
No one is there yet.	Qofna weli ma joogo.
Obviously you can't just say.	Sida iska cad ma sheegi kartid kaliya.
But you can tell.	Laakiin waad sheegi kartaa.
They did not lie.	Been kuma ay sheegin.
That she will leave.	In ay iska tagi doonto.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd muddo dheer.
Much more is needed before it can be paid for.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa loo baahan yahay ka hor inta uusan la bixin.
Another man came in.	Nin kale ayaa soo galay.
Not sure.	Ma hubo taas.
I wish he was here.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan joogo.
I'm sorry for him, but he was a little surprised.	Waan ka xumahay isaga, laakiin wuu yara yaabay.
Something happened to me.	Wax baa igu dhacay.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
Everything is beautiful.	Wax walba qurux baa ku jira.
Many things are good.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa wanaagsan.
Can someone please help me?	Qof fadlan ma i caawin karaa.
This is difficult.	Tani waa mid adag.
And, that's right.	Oo, waa sax.
This is something new.	Tani waa wax cusub.
Probably three of them.	Malaha saddex ka mid ah.
As if.	Sida haddii .
It was a long time coming.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer soo socda.
Now he is surprised.	Hadda wuu yaabay.
It's a problem.	Waa dhibaato.
What now? 	Hadda waa maxay?
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I wanted to know everything about it.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ka ogaado.
He was not one of us.	Mid naga mid ah ma ahayn.
It was close.	Waxay ahayd wax dhow.
What could be better than that?	Maxaa taas ka wanaagsan?.
It seems.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa.
Lots of this.	Wax badan oo tan ah.
I left you.	waan kaa tagay.
I don't like you anymore.	Mar dambe kuma jecli.
He wanted to leave, all.	Waxa uu rabay in uu ka baxo, dhammaan.
I'm not even sure they will allow it.	Xitaa ma hubo inay u ogolaan doonaan.
There was a car.	Waxaa jiray baabuur.
Now they have to do it.	Hadda waa inay sameeyaan.
Not first.	Maaha marka hore.
Today is correct.	Maanta waa sax.
I know what to do.	Waan ogahay waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo.
It is more beautiful here.	Way ka qurux badan tahay halkan.
But this can also be delayed.	Laakiin tani waxay sidoo kale dib u dhici kartaa.
Which you need to do as well.	Taas oo aad u baahan tahay inaad sidoo kale sameyso.
He can help you.	Wuu ku caawin karaa.
It was a lot to work on.	Waxay ahayd wax badan in laga shaqeeyo.
Unable to take.	Meel aan loo qaadan karin.
I hope we will.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan sameyn doono.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
Here, there was none.	Halkan, ma jirin.
Still, it could be better.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, way ka sii fiicnaan kartaa.
Something happened to him.	Wax isaga ku jira ayaa ka dhacay.
They both need money.	Labaduba waxay u baahan yihiin lacag.
He would really do.	Runtii wuu yeeli lahaa.
It’s hard to find something like that.	Way adag tahay in lagu helo wax la mid ah.
I have not seen you.	kuma arag.
I tried to help.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan caawiyo.
Obviously she did.	Sida iska cad way samaysay.
Something happened to me.	Wax baa igu soo dhacay.
I have to see what it is.	Waa inaan arko waxa ay tahay.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax aan ka qaban karno taas.
It's just this.	Waa tan kaliya.
he could not find.	wuu heli waayay.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
But, he did not.	Laakiin, ma uu samayn.
However it was urgent.	Si kasta oo ay ahayd degdeg.
I can see that in him.	Waxaan taas ku arki karaa isaga.
He saw something else.	Wax kale ayuu arkay.
I am really happy about that.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
This is something to see at home.	Tani waa wax ay tahay in la arko guriga.
There is no time now.	Waqti hadda ma jiro.
And because you are beautiful.	Iyo sababta oo ah waad qurux badan tahay.
There are a lot of unknown things here.	Waxa jira waxyaabo badan oo aan la garanayn halkan.
That is not just an idea.	Taasi fikrad kaliya maaha.
I really hope to be back soon !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan si dhab ah u soo noqdo dhawaan!.
I would do whatever he does.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta oo uu sameeyo.
Not everyone likes everything all the time.	Qof kastaa ma jecla wax walba mar kasta.
It looks beautiful.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid qurux badan.
There was, as always, no one there.	Waxaa jiray, sida had iyo jeer, qofna halkaas ma jirin.
You did real things.	Waxaad samaysay waxyaabo dhab ah.
He wanted to leave.	Wuu rabay inuu baxo.
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa .
He is doing a good job.	Shaqo wanaagsan ayuu hayaa.
But you will get something.	Laakiin waxaad heli doontaa wax.
Everyone has three friends.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay saddex saaxiib.
That is not just me.	Taasi aniga kaliya maaha.
Great place to have you here	Meel fiican oo aad ku leedahay halkan
I really wish you were here.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkaan joogto.
No luck.	Wax nasiib ah maaha sababta.
No one can help me.	Qofna ma iga caawin karaa.
Otherwise, it was very difficult.	Haddii kale, waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
No problem.	Dhib ma rabo.
Maybe a lot of things.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waxyaabo badan.
I love beautiful things.	Waxaan jeclahay waxyaabo qurux badan.
She should know.	Waa in ay ogaato.
I will tell you this once, and once.	Tan waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa hal mar, iyo hal mar.
I want to do this for him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan u sameeyo isaga.
It was a very difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u adag.
He didn't really believe it.	Aad uma uu rumaysan.
He is a beautiful man.	Waa nin qurux badan.
Glad to know him.	Ku faraxsanahay in aan ogaado isaga.
And maybe he can.	Oo laga yaabo inuu awoodo.
No one seems to know what that could be.	Qofna uma eka inuu garanayo waxa ay taasi noqon karto.
I think he can do it.	Waxaan filayaa inuu samayn karo.
That was all there, for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhammaan halkaas, hubaal.
Everyone is gone.	Qof walba wuu baxay.
In fact, all the better.	Dhab ahaantii, dhammaan ka wanaagsan.
I'm pretty sure this too, is a lie.	Waxaan aad u hubaa in tani sidoo kale, ay tahay been.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
Long chance there.	Fursad dheer halkaas.
You have to be lucky.	Waa inaad nasiib u leedahay.
I didn't like it very much.	Aad uma jeclayn.
I want to be there for everything.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba u joogo.
You can help	Waad ku caawin kartaa
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
Not until you want to.	Ma aha ilaa aad rabto.
Everyone knows others.	Qof kastaa wuu yaqaan dadka kale.
That's how it was.	Taasi waa sidii ay ahayd.
I'm glad he is.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu yahay.
We would not do otherwise.	Si kale ma yeeli lahayn.
The door only.	Albaabka kaliya .
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd .
What happened? ' 	Maxaa dhacay?'
Everything else is great.	Wax kasta oo kale waa weyn.
I think he bought that.	Waxaan filayaa inuu taas iibsaday.
This includes no certainty.	Tan waxaa ka mid ah ma jiro hubaal la'aan.
Clearly and unnecessary.	Si cad oo aan loo baahnayn .
It was home.	Waxay ahayd guriga.
This is always true.	Tani mar walba waa run.
No one was found.	Mid la helay ma jiro.
Maybe he's at home, don't you know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu guriga joogo, miyaadan ogayn.
He had many other things to do.	Waxa uu lahaa waxyaabo kale oo badan oo uu sameeyo.
Someone will come.	Qof baa iman doona.
She realized she wasn't.	Way ogaatay inaysan ahayn.
I think she will do that.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sameyn doonto.
They weren’t there for me.	Ma ay joogin aniga.
Something else is coming.	Wax kale ayaa soo socda.
Although it was very good.	In kasta oo ay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
There was no urgency	Ma jirin wax degdeg ah
I know if nothing else.	Waan ogahay haddii aysan jirin wax kale.
She was not a friend.	Ma aysan ahayn saaxiib.
It would be great.	Aad bay u fiicnaan lahayd.
The best way to do this is to be present.	Sida ugu fiican ee taas loo samayn karaa waa in la joogo.
You just can't do that.	Kaliya taas ma sameyn kartid.
She will do it for me.	Way ii samayn doontaa.
You look so beautiful.	Waxaad u egtahay mid qurux badan.
In fact he promised he would not do it.	Dhab ahaantii waxa uu ballan qaaday in aanu samayn doonin.
Not sure.	Ma hubo runtii.
That we can still be together.	In aan weli wada joogi karno.
Something similar as he said.	Wax la mid ah sida uu sheegay.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
That had nothing to do with it.	Taasi shaqo kuma lahayn.
But nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale oo aan ahayn.
I hope you do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso.
Nothing was seen there.	Ma jirin wax halkaas lagu arkay.
It's a great place	Waa meel fiican
I had to do that a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd inaan sidaas sameeyo wakhti dheer ka hor.
Maybe a little.	Malaha wax yar.
He looked at me	I eegay
Maybe that was true.	Malaha taasi run bay ahayd.
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
Not one year.	Hal sano maaha.
He had one at school today.	Mid buu ku lahaa dugsiga maanta.
He felt that one all.	Waxa uu dareemay in mid ka mid ah oo dhan.
I am very scared	Aad ayaan uga baqayaa
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
And you clearly went out.	Oo aad si cad u baxay.
Don't do anything again.	Wax dib ha u qaban.
Although it doesn't matter who she is.	In kasta oo aanay waxba ahayn cidda ay tahay.
All taken.	Dhammaan waa la qaatay.
It may not be much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay wax badan ahayn.
He saw something in me.	Wax buu igu arkay.
That was true, she did.	Taas oo run ahayd, way samaysay.
Which is probably a good idea.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
They will take it.	Way qaadan doonaan.
I know you want to help.	Waan ogahay inaad rabto inaad caawiso.
The reason can be seen.	Sababta waxaa laga arki karaa.
He was more than one man.	Waxa uu ahaa in ka badan hal nin.
I wondered who it was.	Yaab yaa ahaa.
.	.
One is all we need.	Mid waa waxa aan u baahanahay oo dhan.
You can expect everything from us.	Wax walba waad naga filan kartaa.
It always is.	Had iyo jeer waa.
I saw something.	Wax baan arkay.
I wish I had one.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan haysto mid.
Let me do it.	Ha igu sameeyo.
No one had food.	Qofna cunto ma haysan.
I did not know.	Maan garanayn.
It's great !.	Waa wax fiican!.
Hold on tight.	Si adag u qabo.
I don't want to do too much.	Ma doonayo inaan wax badan sameeyo.
That was taken.	Taas ayaa loo qaatay.
What he could not say.	Wixii uu ku odhan waayay.
He seemed unbelievable.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aan la rumaysan karin.
They really do.	Runtii way sameeyaan.
That's how bad it is.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun tahay.
Much, much worse than before.	In badan, aad uga xun sidii hore.
Good for you.	Ku fiican adiga.
it is not.	ma ahan.
But it doesn't matter.	Laakiin waxba maaha.
Do you have.	Ma waxaad leedahay .
I can't find him.	Ma heli karo isaga.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
Just take it all.	Kaliya qaado dhammaan.
I think that's right.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax tahay.
That is so.	Taasi waa sidaas.
I can't see and I don't have anyone.	Ma arki karo qofna ma haysto.
He looked at him.	Wuu eegay isaga.
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
They are very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan yihiin.
What happened here.	Maxaa halkan ka dhacay.
But he liked it.	Laakiin wuu ka helay.
But it is not the same.	Laakiin isku mid maaha.
That is a bad idea.	Taasi waa fikrad xun .
That can be done.	Taasi waa la samayn karaa.
There is nothing you can do now.	Ma jiraan wax aad hadda samayn karto.
That was no small task.	Taasi shaqo yar ma ahayn.
I don't want that for you.	Taas adiga kuma rabo.
It can be very good.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
Another man.	Nin kale.
No problem if you tell them now.	Wax dhib ah malaha haddii aad hadda u sheegto.
It's a little harder than that.	Way ka yara adag tahay taas.
And a lot of friends, too.	Iyo saaxiibo badan, sidoo kale.
He made everything really fun.	Wax walba wuxuu ka dhigay mid si dhab ah u faraxsan.
He said he would not leave the house.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu ka bixi doonin guriga.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe sidaas maaha.
You can pay for something bad.	Waxaad bixin kartaa wax xun.
For a friend.	Ee saaxiib.
But she did not leave.	Laakiin meesha way ka bixi wayday.
That may be a precedent.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid hore.
That's a lot of money.	Taasi waa lacag aad u badan.
I just have to do it.	Kaliya waa inaan sameeyaa.
Now there.	Hadda waxaa jira.
But it was also not very good.	Laakiin sidoo kale ma ahayn mid aad u wanaagsan.
And, this is true.	Oo, tani waa run.
I have always been with you.	Had iyo jeer waan kuu joogi jiray.
He said loudly.	Aad buu u yidhi.
It is very fast.	Aad ayuu u degdeg badan yahay.
Work is still needed.	Shaqada weli waa loo baahan yahay.
But I didn't want to.	Laakiin ima rabin.
You did that.	Adiga ayaa taas sameeyay.
I can speak clearly.	Si cad ayaan u hadli karaa.
But he did not tell anyone why.	Laakiin cidna uma uu sheegin sababta.
It's smart and amazing.	Waa caqli iyo yaab.
But he lost.	Laakiin wuu waayay.
No problems were permanent.	Wax dhibaato ah ma ahayn mid joogto ah.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
But it may not be.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay ahayn.
He should not be here.	Waa inuusan halkaan joogin.
But it's just me.	Laakiin waa aniga oo kaliya.
That can happen to anyone.	Taasi qofna way ku dhici kartaa.
sax uma eka	sax uma eka
Stop everything you are doing.	Jooji wax kasta oo aad samaynayso.
And don't tell them.	Oo ha u sheegin.
He gave a lot of things to friends.	Wuxuu siiyay waxyaabo badan saaxiibo.
You can get it any way you want.	Waxaad u heli kartaa si kasta oo aad rabto.
To come back, really.	Si aan u soo noqdo, dhab ahaantii.
Not sure how to do this.	Ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
It was something else.	Wax kale ayuu ahaa.
I do not know how and why.	Ma garanayo sida iyo sababta.
I did the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan sameeyay.
I have never seen anything like it.	Wali ma arag wax la mid ah.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
But that did not stop him.	Laakiin taasi ma joojin isaga.
He didn't want to know, either.	Ma uusan rabin inuu ogaado, sidoo kale.
Now I am at home	Hadda waxaan joogaa guriga
That's fine there.	Taasi waa ku fiican tahay halkaas.
I was surprised you did.	Waxaan la yaabay inaad sameyso.
It has always been good.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
In fact, it was a lot.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd wax badan.
You said that, several times.	Adiga ayaa sidaas sheegtay, dhowr jeer.
I never really did.	Weligay runtii ma samayn.
We were home.	Waxaan ahayn guriga.
She didn't think so.	Waxay u malayn wayday.
There was no one there.	Meesha qofna ma jirin.
There is a lot of time.	Waqti badan ayaa jira.
I didn't give a damn.	Waxba ma siin.
At one point, it would be him and me.	Hal mar, waxay noqon lahayd isaga iyo aniga.
He knew this for sure.	Wuu ogaa tan hubaal.
That is good for us.	Taasi waa nagu fiican tahay.
And how much she wants to know.	Iyo inta ay rabto in ay ogaato.
I can't lie.	Been uma sheegi karo.
I can see it now	Hadda waan arki karaa
Really good food.	Runtii cunto wanaagsan.
But he seemed very happy.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u faraxsan.
Maybe they still do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli sameeyaan.
But maybe not there.	Laakiin malaha halkaas.
Maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa .
Not real.	Mid dhab ah maaha.
I think it would be a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan lahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
That is not what we are.	Taasi maaha waxa aan nahay.
She promised not to mention.	Waxay ballan ku qaaday in aanay sheegin.
He is at work.	Shaqada ayuu ku jiraa.
I have a lot of work to do.	Waxaan hayaa shaqo badan.
Now I got it.	Hadda waan helay.
Just like you, really.	Si la mid ah adiga, runtii.
I never got to say it.	Weligay ma helin inaan sheego.
Something terrible happened here.	Wax aad u xun ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
I know enough is enough that you do not believe anything.	Waan ogahay in kugu filan inaadan waxba rumaysan.
Let me be clear.	Aan si cad u sheego.
It is a lie.	Waa been.
I got nothing.	Waxba ma helin.
There is not enough.	Ma jiraan wax ku filan.
She could not leave.	Way ka bixi wayday.
I thought we might be friends again.	Waxaan u maleeyay in laga yaabo inaan mar kale saaxiibo noqon karno.
She was familiar.	Waxay ahayd la yaqaan.
It is not a coincidence.	Ma aha wax iska dhacay.
See you there !.	Meesha ku arag!.
But it is not true	Laakiin run maaha
It was what they loved to do.	Waxay ahayd waxay jecel yihiin inay sameeyaan.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
It was good.	Waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
It’s more than that, well.	Way ka sii badan tahay, si fiican.
Maybe it was worse.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ahayd wax ka xun.
It was almost time for another one.	Waxay ahayd waqti ku dhow mid kale.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
Many of us love it.	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaa jecel.
It looks like this is.	Waxay u egtahay in tani ay tahay.
I will help you.	Waan kaa caawin doonaa.
He will come to us.	Wuu noo iman doona.
This was unspoken.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aan la sheegin.
It wasn’t much to see.	Wax badan ma ahayn in la arko.
Everything is well done.	Wax walba si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
He has become wise.	Caqli buu noqday.
It has to do everything you want.	Waa inay sameyso dhammaan waxaad rabto.
They will do something about it.	Wax bay ka qaban doonaan.
Even a little bit.	Xitaa wax yar.
Maybe he really loves me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu runtii i jecel yahay.
I'm sorry, 'he said badly.	Waan ka xumahay,' ayuu si xun u yidhi.
This is clearly false.	Tani waxay si cad u been tahay.
Love to do it.	Jeclahay in uu sameeyo.
But it does nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma samaynayso.
There really was nothing, nobody was nothing.	Runtii waxba ma jirin, cidna waxba uma ahayn.
I know she will do the same for you.	Waan ogahay inay sidaas oo kale kuu samayn doonto.
He did a little.	Wax yar ayuu sameeyay.
Every time you help someone else.	Mar kasta oo aad qof kale caawiso.
Certainly not the same.	Hubaal isku mid maaha.
I think that's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run tahay.
I think he is very happy.	Waxaan filayaa inuu aad ugu faraxsan yahay.
In fact, they are already.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay hore u yihiin.
I love having a good time.	Waxaan jeclahay waqti fiican.
It would be nice to see you.	Way fiicnaan lahayd inaan ku arko.
She still refuses.	Weli way diiday.
Something else is coming.	Wax kale ayaa soo socda.
You look good.	Waxaad u egtahay mid fiican.
There’s a lot, too.	Waxaa jira wax badan, sidoo kale.
But clear, hard truth.	Laakiin cad, run adag.
They live together.	Way wada nool yihiin.
Maybe he knows better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu si fiican u yaqaan.
Does he too.	Miyuu sidoo kale.
I hold everything beautifully.	Wax walba si qurux badan ayaan u hayaa.
I came out.	Waan ka soo baxay.
But that is why you are here.	Laakiin taasi waa sababta aad halkan u joogto.
It will take people’s work.	Waxay qaadan doontaa shaqada dadka.
I spent a lot of time here.	Waqti badan ayaan ku qaatay halkan.
I don't know enough about myself	Ma garanayo wax igu filan
He tried everything.	Wax walba wuu isku dayay.
Very happy, really.	Aad u faraxsan, runtii.
Just everything bad.	Kaliya wax walba oo xun.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
Would it be true.	Ma run bay ahaan lahayd.
One will be fine.	Mid ayaa fiicnaan doona.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
They are all out.	Waa la soo wada baxay.
She says nothing.	Waxba uma sheegto.
You will do it for me.	Waad ii samayn doontaa.
He decided to find out.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu ogaado.
I can be anyone.	Waxaan noqon karaa qof kasta.
I will get it now.	Hadda waan heli doonaa.
He was very clear.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u cad cad.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
Great job indeed.	Shaqo weyn runtii.
It was already home.	Waxay hore u ahayd guriga.
I told him I would not do that.	Waxaan u sheegay inaanan sidaas yeeli doonin.
That is not a bad idea.	Taasi fikrad xun maaha.
But take this.	Laakiin tan qaado.
That is much more true now.	Taasi aad bay uga run badan tahay hadda.
That's all so far.	Waa dhan ilaa hadda.
We can't get that.	Ma heli karno sidaas .
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
He came to us yesterday to tell us.	Shalay ayuu noo yimid inuu noo sheego.
Maybe that’s just me.	Malaha taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Do you love?.	Ma jeceshahay?.
Maybe he knew everything.	Malaha wax walba wuu ogaa.
But not everyone wants it.	Laakiin qof walba ma doonayo.
But there may be another truth.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto run kale.
Not him, exactly.	Ma aha isaga, si sax ah.
But that was now unthinkable.	Laakiin taasi hadda waxay ahayd wax aan la malayn karin.
I found it to be very good.	Waxaan u arkay inay tahay mid aad u fiican.
Everything is new.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay tan.
Nothing interesting, for sure.	Wax xiiso leh ma jiro, hubaal.
And really even after that.	Oo runtii xitaa ka dib taas.
You are not alone.	Adiga kaliya maaha.
He thinks that's really bad for you.	Waxa uu u malaynayaa in ay taasi runtii kuu xun tahay.
I told you so.	sidaas ayaan kuu sheegay.
Everything, really.	Wax walba, runtii.
Not that she said much.	Ma aha in ay wax badan sheegtay.
I did not want to be left behind.	Ma rabin in la iga tago.
It needs to be seen.	Waxay u baahan tahay in la arko.
Just tell them where.	Kaliya u sheeg meesha.
How can that be? 	Sidee taasi noqon kartaa?
All at once.	Dhammaan isku mar.
It is still too early here	Wali waa goor hore halkan
Now obviously.	Hadda iska cad .
This is certainly not difficult to do.	Tani dhab ahaantii ma aha mid adag in la sameeyo.
I think he felt very bad.	Waxaan filayaa inuu aad u xun dareemay.
It really is only one day.	Runtii waa hal maalin oo kaliya.
Do not go.	Ha tagin.
Both are fine.	Labaduba waa iska fiican yihiin.
But for me, it is not you.	Laakiin aniga, adiga maaha.
It is new.	Way cusub tahay.
I think they are happy.	Waxaan filayaa inay faraxsan yihiin.
Not now.	Hadda ma jiro.
He must have tried.	Waa in uu isku dayay.
I would do the same.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax la mid ah.
What it was, it was.	Maxay ahayd, waxay ahayd.
You said I would talk about it.	Waxaad tidhi waan ka hadli doonaa.
I had the same luck anyway.	Waxaan lahaa nasiib isku mid ah si kasta.
There was something very good.	Wax aad u fiican baa jiray.
Nothing comes back.	Waxba kama soo noqdo.
I am not so small	Anigu sidaas uma yara
You are in me.	Adiga ayaa igu jira.
It is now ready	Hadda waa diyaar
It looks so good !.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican!.
There was no one available	Ma jirin mid la heli karo
It was the right thing to do.	Waxay ahayd wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
This will not do.	Tani ma yeeli doonto.
It can be difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
Nothing came without a hitch.	Waxba ma iman dhib la'aan.
You are the one who did the right thing.	Adiga ayaa ah inaad samaysay wax sax ah.
I think it is not difficult.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in aysan ahayn mid adag.
He knew very little.	Wax yar buu ogaa.
It may not be included.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ku jirin.
That can be very obvious.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u cad.
Probably they are.	Waxay u badan tahay inay yihiin.
Maybe it was the same.	Malaha waxay ahayd isku mid.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo .
And this, several times a day.	Oo tan, dhowr jeer maalin kasta.
This was not the only good thing.	Tani kaliya wax wanaagsan ma ahayn.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
I have been here several times.	Dhowr jeer ayaa halkan joogay.
Nothing would come of it.	Waxba kama iman lahaa.
Not a bad day.	Maalin xun maaha.
It is a very, very important thing.	Waa wax aad iyo aad u baahan.
He fell behind.	Wuu dib u dhacay.
I have an idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad.
Not much, but enough.	Ma badna, laakiin ku filan.
I couldn't do anything wrong.	Wax xun ma sameyn karin.
I don't have to talk to him.	Ma aha inaan la hadlo isaga.
A man can.	Nin wuu karaa.
Exactly,.	Si sax ah, .
They always do.	Had iyo jeer way sameeyaan.
I think she probably did.	Waxaan filayaa inay malaha samaysay.
I really don't know what to do.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
Not, for the most part, anyway.	Ma aha, inta badan, si kasta.
He does a lot.	Aad buu u sameeyaa.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
Anyway he said.	Si walba ayuu yiri.
To talk to.	Si aan ula hadlo.
Very well done.	Aad u wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
I can't see it any other way.	Si kale uma arki karo.
It is new.	Waa mid cusub.
You know it is.	Waad ogtahay inay sidaas tahay.
I will just take everything.	Kaliya wax walba waan qaadan doonaa.
we will see you again soon	mar kale ayaan ku arki doonaa dhawaan
There was so much food.	Waxaa jiray cunto aad u badan.
I know you do your best.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyso waxa ugu fiican.
It's better not to talk about it.	Waxaa fiican inaanan ka hadlin.
Go home early.	Goor hore inaad guriga aado.
As you do.	Sida aad sameyso.
They just have to do it.	Waa inay sameeyaan kaliya.
It is definitely known.	Dhab ahaantii waa la yaqaan.
I'm not sure it will be.	Ma hubo inay ahaan doonto.
I have already fallen.	Hore ayaan u dhacay.
I'm sorry	waan xumahay
It was all she knew.	Waxay ahayd wax kasta oo ay ogtahay.
It's all there.	Waa u wada dhan.
They do not exist today.	Maanta ma jiraan.
She didn't want her here.	Ma rabin inay halkan joogto.
He has been there for less than a year.	Waxa uu joogay in ka yar hal sano.
She had no food.	Wax cunto cunto ah ma ay lahayn.
you can't stay	ma joogi kartid
Maybe there is more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay jiraan wax ka badan.
She would do something about it.	Wax bay iska samayn lahayd.
He made it difficult.	Waxa uu ka dhigay mid adag.
I'm not sure what's out there.	Ma hubo waxa halkaas ka jira.
He didn't like this.	Ma uu jeclayn tan.
It was very difficult.	Dhib badan bay ahayd.
There is no other.	Mid kale ma jiro.
Not the same, but the same.	Isku mid maaha, laakiin la mid ah .
He wants me to leave.	Wuxuu rabaa inaan baxo.
I did a little.	Wax yar ayaan sameeyay.
There is so much.	Waxaa jira wax aad u badan.
No one will see you.	Qofna kuma arki doono.
You think you do.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad samaynayso.
How are you.	Sidee tahay.
Someone was with us.	Qof baa nagu jiray.
But what was it.	Laakiin maxay ahayd.
But he left.	Laakiin wuu baxay.
You do not have to do much.	Uma baahnid inaad wax weyn ka sameyso.
He is really good at everything.	Runtii wuu ku fiican yahay wax kasta.
Everyone has something in it.	Qof walba wax baa ku jira.
How hard is that ?.	Sidee u adag tahay taas?.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
I really don’t do that much.	Runtii taas wax badan ma sameeyo.
I was not present	Maan joogin
Not discussed.	Lama wada hadlin.
Not too small	Aad uma yara
Otherwise, well.	Haddii kale, si fiican.
He certainly got it now.	Waa hubaal inuu hadda helay.
You do not need to know what it is.	Uma baahnid inaad ogaato waxa ay tahay.
I decided to leave.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan ka tago.
Not surprisingly, really.	Ma aha wax yaab leh, runtii.
You can do anything.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta.
I have a job	Waxaan leeyahay shaqo
Maybe that’s true, too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi run tahay, sidoo kale.
They will find you.	Way ku heli doonaan.
It can be very new.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax aad u cusub.
I want you to know that.	Waxaan rabaa inaad taas ogaato.
I should have known that.	Waxay ahayd inaan taas ogaado.
I think that's something.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi wax tahay.
you are a beautiful man.	nin qurux badan baad tahay.
It was a very difficult job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo aad u adag.
Maybe it was too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidoo kale ahayd.
But he did nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma uu qaban.
Maybe you haven't seen it.	Malaha ma aadan arag.
But we were friends.	Laakiin waxaan ahayn saaxiibo.
This needs to be stated firmly.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay in si adag loo sheego.
Too bad.	Waxyaabo aad u xun.
If you really want to know.	Haddii aad runtii rabto inaad ogaato.
There is so much more to say.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo kale oo la sheegi karo.
I have no idea what they do, really.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxay sameeyaan, run ahaantii.
But this again.	Laakiin tani mar kale.
Now she had.	Hadda way lahayd.
It was a while ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti ka hor.
Every meal was the same.	Cunto kasta isku mid bay ahayd.
But this was really a very difficult time for me.	Laakiin tani runtii waxay ii ahayd wakhti aad u adag.
If someone could help it would be great.	Haddii qof uu caawin karo way fiicnaan lahayd.
How he knows so much.	Sidee ayuu u garanayaa in badan .
It is not too late.	Ma aha goor dambe.
Three of them arrived.	Saddex ka mid ah ayaa yimid.
To say.	Si aan u sheego.
And he thinks you like it too.	Oo wuxuu u maleynayaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay.
I have to stay home	Waa inaan guriga joogo
That's what.	Taasi waa waxa .
They are good at that.	Way ku fiican yihiin taas.
I don't have to be here.	Ma aha inaan halkan joogo.
She lied to herself.	Been bay isku sheegtay.
I love everything in you.	Wax walba oo kugu jira waan jeclahay.
It's great for me.	Mid weyn bay ii tahay.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
Even one that never says much.	Xitaa mid aan waligiis wax badan odhan.
I love this more than any other.	Tan ayaan ka jeclahay mid kasta oo kale.
He should not have done this.	Ma ahayn inuu tan sameeyo.
Making is another.	Samaynta waa mid kale.
That did not come out.	Taasi ma soo bixin.
He was a beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan buu ahaa.
It was a long time coming.	Wuxuu ahaa waqti dheer soo socda.
First, it may be correct.	Marka hore, wuxuu noqon karaa mid sax ah.
It's a great place.	Waa meel aad u fiican.
And well, too.	Iyo sidoo kale, sidoo kale.
This is how and why.	Tani waa sida iyo sababta.
Don't misunderstand me.	Ha i fahmin.
I think this can help.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto.
It looks like everything is there.	Waxay u egtahay in wax walba ay jiraan.
Nothing else was said.	Wax kale lama odhan.
No one else was here.	Qof kale halkan ma joogin.
I think it could not be predicted.	Waxaan filayaa in aan la sii sheegi karin.
Tell all if you.	Dhammaan sheeg haddii aad.
No one else sees it.	Qof kale ma arko.
If you are good, you are good.	Haddii aad wanaagsan tahay, waad wanaagsan tahay.
That’s why she found out she could do this.	Taasi waa sababta ay u ogaatay inay tan samayn karto.
And you know, it probably was.	Oo waad ogtahay, waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd.
It's good, but it's not surprising.	Way fiican tahay, laakiin maaha mid la yaab leh.
It's money again.	Waa lacag mar kale.
It was how they lived.	Waxay ahayd sida ay u nool yihiin.
But this is definitely old.	Laakiin tani hubaal waa hore .
I think where you are.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in meesha aad joogto.
I told you why.	Waxaan kuu sheegay sababta.
It should not have.	Ma ahayn inay.
This is definitely true.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa run.
Maybe she had.	Malaha way lahayd.
Something unthinkable he said.	Wax aan la malayn karin ayuu yidhi.
Very close, very close.	Aad u dhow, aad u dhow.
I hope to get there.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan halkaas ku helo.
He already knows me.	Hore ayuu ii garanayaa.
You can't cause any more problems.	Dhibaato kale ma yeeli kartid.
Maybe that’s too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ay tahay mid aad u badan.
That's what they really have to do.	Taasi waa waxa runtii ay tahay inay sameeyaan.
he was surprised.	wuu yaabay.
But then, no idea.	Laakiin ka dib, wax fikrad ah.
But this was a lie.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd been.
That was not a coincidence.	Taasi wax iska dhacay ma ahayn.
He never came.	Waligiis uma iman.
Take it for sure.	Qaado si hubaal ah .
It was found.	Waa la helay.
He has to go	Waa inuu aado
I have no idea what this might be.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxa ay tani noqon karto.
I wanted to keep it.	Waxaan rabay inaan sii hayo.
I am always in it.	mar walba waan ku jiraa .
No one can be better.	Qofna uma fiicnaan karo.
But obviously he did.	Laakiin sida cad wuu sameeyay.
Maybe that’s because he talks less.	Malaha taasi waa sababta oo ah wax yar oo uu ka hadlo.
I want to be there	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkaas joogo
That is so beautiful.	Taasi waa wax aad u qurux badan.
Now it’s just me and him.	Hadda waa aniga iyo isaga kaliya.
I know it will happen.	Waan ogahay inay dhici doonto.
He did not want to be there.	Ma uusan rabin inuu halkaas joogo.
No one is really happy.	Runtii qof faraxsan ma jiro.
He wanted to leave.	Waxa uu rabay in uu baxo.
Maybe he saw something.	Malaha wax buu arkay.
Everyone has to go.	Qof walba waa inuu tago.
Maybe he should have known better.	Malaha waxay ahayd inuu si fiican u yaqaan.
Someone will be ready.	Qof ayaa diyaar noqon doona.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
hold on a bit	xoogaa u qabo
It's hard for me.	Way igu adag tahay.
I hope he is not at work tonight.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan caawa shaqada ku jirin.
You certainly should.	Waa hubaal inaad.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
It will not hurt.	Kuma yeeli doono.
Nice to see you.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay inaan ku arko.
He came in.	Meesha ayuu soo galay.
She was very popular.	Waxay ahayd mid aad loo yaqaan.
In fact, you can do more than this.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka badan tan.
It was unknown.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la garanayn.
I didn’t get a chance to find out.	Maan helin fursad aan ku ogaado.
Give him the best.	Isaga sii inta ugu fiican.
He refused.	Wuu iska diiday.
It can happen to anyone, not even anyone like me.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta, xitaa qof aniga oo kale ah ma jiro.
I have another idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad kale.
There was something wrong.	Waxaa jiray wax aan sax ahayn.
That is something that will never happen again.	Taasi waa wax aan dhici doonin mar dambe.
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
First, it is not really true.	Marka hore, run ahaantii run maaha.
But it is nothing else.	Laakiin ma aha wax kale.
But that didn't work out.	Laakiin taasi waxba kama soo bixin.
There was nothing that anyone could do for him.	Ma jirin wax qof u samayn karo isaga.
It was not very beautiful.	Ma ahayn mid aad u qurux badan.
But this is exactly what you want.	Laakiin tani waa si sax ah waxa aad rabto.
Everything I needed was available at home.	Wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay ayaa laga heli jiray guriga.
I know him very well.	Runtii si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
But very little.	Laakiin aad u yar.
He has to eat.	Waa inuu wax cuno.
I say.	Waxaan leeyahay.
He is a very smart man.	Waa nin caqli badan.
I always hope.	Had iyo jeer waan rajeynayaa.
What a great.	Waa maxay weyn.
One person.	Hal qof.
He should have known what had happened.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado waxa dhacay.
It felt a little bad.	Waxa la dareemay wax yar oo xun.
No one has, as far as she knows.	Qofna ma haysan, ilaa hadda inta ay ogtahay.
Maybe you are good at it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ku fiican tahay.
I don't feel right	Ma dareemayo sax
They love it so much.	Aad bay u jecel yihiin.
She should know better.	Waa inay si fiican u ogaato.
How we live.	Sida aan u nool nahay.
There was a man at the door.	albaabka waxaa joogay qof.
I decided to leave work early today.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan shaqada ka tago goor hore oo maanta ah.
I didn't get it.	Ma helin.
If so, he would take it.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, wuu qaadan lahaa.
They will come to me.	Way ii iman doonaan.
You know, everything you wanted was great.	Waad ogtahay, wax kasta oo aad rabto ayaa ahaa mid weyn.
Absolutely no one.	Dhab ahaantii qofna ma jiro.
I really fell for it.	Runtii waan ku dhacay.
It would be me.	Aniga ayaa ahaan lahayd.
This was good.	Tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
Now she would be someone else for a while.	Hadda waxay ahaan lahayd qof kale in muddo ah.
I know what that looks like.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u egtahay.
They make a lot of money and a lot of money.	Waxay sameeyaan lacag badan iyo lacag badan.
He does it only when he is happy.	Wuxuu sameeyaa kaliya marka uu faraxsan yahay.
It is always the same.	Had iyo jeer waa isku mid.
You will win.	Waad guulaysan doontaa.
Too much for me.	Aad ii badan.
It’s all together.	Waa wax walba oo wada jira.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
Not so with every time we spend together.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale waqti kasta oo la wada qaatay.
He once said.	Mar buu yidhi.
Any time will do for me.	Waqti kasta ayaa ii qaban doona.
He is not just a man.	Nin kaliya maaha.
You don't even have to be here.	Xitaa maaha inaad halkan joogto.
I don't think it's very beautiful.	Uma maleynayo inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
Not much.	Ma aha in badan.
That's what he does.	Waa waxa uu sameeyo.
It is set enough.	Waa la dhigay in ku filan.
No one seems to know why.	Qofna uma eka inuu garanayo sababta.
He heard.	Wuu maqlay.
They are all you need.	Waxay yihiin waxa aad u baahan tahay oo dhan.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Laakiin malaha taasi waa wax fiican.
I think it is good.	Waxaan qabaa inay tahay mid wanaagsan.
It was right too.	Waxay ahayd mid sax ah sidoo kale.
This will end badly for me.	Tani waxay igu dhammaan doontaa si xun.
That will be tomorrow.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa berri.
But it was the best thing she could do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan ee ay samayn karto.
He may not have seen this before.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan hore u sii arag tan.
It looks familiar.	Waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
He looked very happy.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u faraxsan.
Now he is in the room.	Hadda waxa uu joogaa qolka.
No wonder, too.	La yaab maaha, sidoo kale.
I wish it could be found everywhere.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in meel walba laga heli karo.
It cannot be clear.	Waxa cad cad ma noqon karo.
This looks like it will be fun to do.	Tani waxay u egtahay inay noqon doonto mid xiiso leh in la sameeyo.
He really did nothing.	Runtii waxba ma uu samayn.
In fact, one did recently.	Runtii, mid ayaa dhawaan sameeyay.
It was also amazing.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I think that's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiican tahay.
He seemed to feel everything.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu wax walba dareemay.
Just keep busy with other things.	Kaliya ku mashquul waxyaabo kale.
No one has it.	Qofna ma qabo.
He certainly did not know he loved her.	Hubaal ma uusan ogeyn inuu jecel yahay.
I think we can take most of it here, too.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan u qaadan karno inta ugu badan halkan, sidoo kale.
I don't like to do anything.	Ma jecli inaan waxba sameeyo.
As it is not even close	Sida xitaa ma dhow
He wanted to.	Wuxuu rabay .
Sure, I can do that.	Hubaal, waan samayn karaa taas.
There was so much more.	Wax kale oo aad u badan ayaa jiray.
I think that’s the biggest thing.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay waxa ugu weyn.
To do this.	Si arrintan loo sameeyo.
I will tell you more in time.	Wax badan ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa waqti.
I can tell you what is in it.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa waxa ku jira.
I still can't tell.	Wali ma sheegi karo.
I looked good.	Si fiican ayaan u eegay.
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
I took a lot from it.	Wax badan ayaan ka soo qaatay.
But this will not always be the case.	Laakiin tani mar walba sidaas ma ahaan doonto.
Tell us what to do.	Noo sheeg waxa la sameeyo.
That doesn't sound interesting.	Taasi uma eka mid xiiso leh.
I am very happy here	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay halkan
Not right.	Sax uma eka.
You may not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan ahayn.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
Certainly nothing said here is true.	Dhab ahaantii waxba halkan lagu sheegay waa run.
I thought it was very good.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad u fiican tahay.
I am a man of thought.	Waxaan ahay nin fikrad leh.
No problem, this would happen.	Dhib malaha, tani way dhici lahayd.
Just up to the door.	Kaliya ilaa albaabka.
I think it is beautiful.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay qurux badan tahay.
Ah well, it can't be helped right now.	Ah si fiican, hadda lama caawin karo.
Maybe I am one of them.	Malaha waxaan ka mid ahay.
But maybe that's not a problem.	Laakiin malaha taasi dhib maaha.
It was non-existent.	Wax aan jirin bay ahayd.
This must be done.	Tani waa in la sameeyaa.
It is better than that.	Way ka fiican tahay taas.
True and false.	Dhab ah iyo mid aan run ahayn.
I can get away with anything.	Wax walba waan ka bixi karaa.
I would like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa.
There was nothing that she did to cause it.	Wax ay samaysay ma jirin wax sax ah oo ay samaysay.
But there was certainly more to it than that.	Laakiin hubaal waxaa jiray wax ka badan taas.
Today was a great day.	Maanta waxay ahayd maalin aad u weyn.
Everything else is fine.	Wax kasta oo kale waa dhib la'aan.
But it was enough.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid ku filan.
Most of that didn’t matter.	Inta badan taasi shaqo kuma lahayn.
Not available yet.	Waa la heli waayay ilaa hadda.
Maybe I should have spoken earlier.	Malaha waxay ahayd inaan mar hore hadlo.
It should not have.	Ma ahayn inay.
I had no idea it was you.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay adiga tahay.
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
He really said.	Runtii wuu yidhi .
.	.
I think it's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay wax wanaagsan.
There is so much in it.	Wax aad u badan ayaa ku jira.
Great idea.	Fikrad aad u fiican.
Every day is a new day.	Maalin kasta waa maalin cusub.
She told him a good day.	Waxay u sheegtay maalin wanaagsan.
No one could see him.	Cidna ma uu arki karin.
A friend was with me.	Saaxiib baa ila jiray.
But that’s what you are.	Laakiin waa waxa aad tahay.
At one point he put it well.	Hal mar ayuu si fiican u dhigay.
We were not the same.	Waxaan ahayn isku mid.
And maybe I have.	Oo malaha leeyahay.
In fact, this was obvious.	Runtii, tani waxay ahayd si cad.
Not him, but you.	Isaga maaha, laakiin adiga.
Do not allow anything.	Waxba ha u ogolaan.
A man came out.	Nin baa soo baxay.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
He was a bit old.	Wuxuu ahaa xoogaa hore.
Mostly.	Inta ugu badan.
It's easier than that.	Way ka dhib yar tahay.
Both are very smart.	Labaduba aad bay u caqli badan yihiin.
I really fell for it.	Runtii waan ku dhacay.
But the whole prison.	Laakiin xabsiga oo dhan.
I don't want to, obviously.	Ma rabto, sida cad.
I don't want to break up.	Ma rabo inaan kala tago.
He put it.	Wuu dhigay.
Now there is one every day.	Hadda waxaa jira mid maalin kasta.
This is obvious.	Tani waa wax iska cad.
I'm just amazed.	Kaliya waxaan ahay yaab.
.	.
Probably right.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sax ahayd.
She was unaware.	Waxay ahayd mid aan ogayn.
What happened right.	Wixii si sax ah u dhacay.
They may be right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax yihiin.
But for sure otherwise.	Laakiin waa hubaal haddii kale.
For me.	Aniga ahaan.
But you did what you had to do.	Laakiin waxaad samaysay wixii aad samayn lahayd.
Everything is alive.	Wax walba waa nool yihiin.
I did not understand at first.	Maan fahmin markii hore.
A place called.	Meel loo yaqaan .
She has not yet arrived.	Wali ma ay iman.
Now he wants to talk.	Hadda wuxuu rabaa inuu hadlo.
I thought this was a good thing.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay tahay wax wanaagsan.
She will not get it.	Ma heli doonto.
I knew this very well.	Tan si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
It is a problem for someone else.	Waa dhib qof kale leeyahay.
That was great to have.	Taas oo ahayd mid aad u fiican in la haysto.
But he would come so far.	Laakiin wuu iman lahaa ilaa hadda.
He did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma uu sheegin.
As soon as he wanted something, he got it.	Isla markii uu wax rabay, wuu helay.
And very beautiful.	Oo aad u qurux badan.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
Everyone may have done it.	Qof kasta ayaa laga yaabaa inuu sameeyay.
Do not take anything seriously.	Waxba ha u qaadan si dhab ah.
It is not urgent.	Degdeg uma aha .
No one can do that for him.	Qofna taas uma samayn karo isaga.
No one talked much.	Qofna wax badan kama hadlin.
Luckily for everything.	Waa nasiib wax walba.
This is why we do this.	Tani waa sababta aan tan u samayno.
Said a man.	Nin baa sidaas yidhi.
Maybe I don't want to know that.	Waa laga yaabaa oo ma rabo in aan taas ogaado.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
And it contains everything you need to know.	Oo waxaa ku jira wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
She still refuses.	Weli way diiday.
Now intellectually this cannot be true.	Hadda caqli ahaan tani run ma noqon karto.
I wish you would see.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad arki lahayd.
I want to see.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko.
He was very bad.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u xun.
I told you.	Adiga ayaan u sheegay.
I really had a hard time at school.	Runtii waqti adag ayaan ku qaatay dugsiga.
And now he clearly saw why.	Oo hadda si cad ayuu u arkay sababta.
I think it will happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici doonto.
But he was not alone.	Laakiin keligiis ma ahayn.
All, all alone.	Dhammaan, dhammaan keligiis .
We can't do this.	Ma samayn karno tan.
It's really good.	Runtii waa wax wanaagsan.
He seemed ready to leave.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid diyaar u ah in uu meesha ka baxo.
As it should be.	Sidii ay ahaan lahayd.
Definitely enough, that's what she said.	Hubaal ku filan, taasi waa waxa ay tidhi.
He had a place to go.	Meel uu aado ayuu lahaa.
Nothing else can really be done.	Wax kale runtii lama samayn karo.
I never thought that would come.	Waligiis uma malaynayn inay taasi iman doonto.
If they do.	Haddii ay sameeyaan.
Nor did it, before it was discovered.	Sidoo kale ma aysan samayn, ka hor inta aan la helin.
That is work.	Taasi waa shaqo.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
He is a car man.	Waa nin baabuur ah.
It is difficult to say how much of each.	Way adag tahay in la sheego inta mid kasta ah.
I would like to get to know you better.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan si fiican u barto.
Still, what happened a long time ago.	Weli, waxa dhacay waa hore.
Here it is !.	Halkan waa!.
He does not want to know.	Ma rabo inuu ogaado.
Another, another, another.	Mid kale, mid kale, mid kale.
I came in	waan soo galay
Lots of fun.	Wax badan oo xiiso leh.
This will not be a problem.	Tani dhib ma ahaan doonto.
They are almost identical.	Waxay ku dhow yihiin isku mid.
I found it here.	Halkan ayaan ka helay.
Each as needed.	Mid kasta sida uu u baahan yahay.
There was no time.	Waqti ma jirin.
But so do others.	Laakiin sidoo kale dadka kale.
Nothing interesting.	Wax xiiso leh maaha.
It does not have to be.	Ma aha inay jirto.
This is not a coincidence.	Tani ma aha wax iska dhacay.
You can leave me here.	Waxaad iga tagi kartaa halkan.
It took me a while to find it.	Wax yar baan ku qaatay si aan u helo.
You can do the same if you want.	Waxaad u samayn kartaa sidii hore haddii aad rabto.
There was nothing here.	Ma jirin wax halkan ka jira.
Just me.	Aniga kaliya.
Very happy for him.	Aad ugu faraxsan isaga.
I thought you would tell.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad u sheegi lahayd.
He did.	Waxa uu sameeyay.
So much so.	Sidaas aad u badan.
You can see if it is ready.	Waad arki kartaa haddii uu diyaar yahay.
He put it off and he is really good.	Dib buu u dhigay oo runtii wuu fiican yahay.
But he will come back to me.	Laakiin wuu ii soo noqon doonaa.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
She can lie.	Been way sheegi kartaa.
I said nothing else.	Wax kale uma odhan.
He was a good man.	Nin fiican buu ahaa.
I need to know why you are here	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta aad halkan u joogto
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Just because.	Sababta kaliya.
I do not.	Ma sameeyo.
I don't want to talk about the same thing.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo wax la mid ah.
Many were surprised.	Wax badan baa yaabay.
Maybe you like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad jeceshahay.
He walked out the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka baxay.
It is certainly nothing new.	Dhab ahaantii wax cusub maaha.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
Not in person.	Ma aha qof ahaan.
It certainly won’t be too bad.	Hubaal ma noqon doonto mid aad u xun .
Like you own the place.	Sida adiga oo meesha iska leh.
I want to see you badly.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko si xun.
He does, but with difficulty.	Wuu sameeyaa, laakiin si dhib yar.
What's closest.	Maxaa ugu dhow.
It is permanent.	Waa joogto.
But he is very smart.	Laakiin waa uu aad u caqli badan yahay.
The main reason is affordable.	Sababta ugu weyn waa la awoodi karo.
What a surprise.	Maxaa la yaab leh.
It's amazing somewhere.	Waa yaab meel.
That's right, we'll see you later.	Sax, waanu ku arki doonaa in yar.
No one had anything to do with it.	Qofna waxba kuma lahayn.
Sure, she had.	Hubaal, waxay lahayd.
There may not be much to say.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan jirin wax badan oo la sheego.
Now, it is definitely a job.	Hadda, hubaal waa shaqo.
Very little.	Aad u yar .
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
I heard enough.	Waxaan maqlay wax igu filan.
I have something to tell you.	wax aan kuu sheego ayaan hayaa.
It was an amazing idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad la yaab leh.
He will do the right thing.	Wuxuu sameyn doonaa wax sax ah.
This is all they do.	Tani waa waxa ay sameeyaan oo dhan.
He will speak.	Wuu hadli doonaa.
You have a good place there.	Meel fiican baad ku leedahay halkaas.
Now it is again.	Hadda waa mar kale.
There are so many things.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa ah.
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
That was why she didn't tell him.	Taas oo ahayd sababta ay u sheegi wayday.
There are three, he said.	Waxaa jira saddex, ayuu yidhi.
It was what everyone thought.	Waxay ahayd waxa qof walba u maleeyay.
It was what he said.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu yidhi.
Anything you may need	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan karto
This is true and not true.	Tani waa run oo run maaha.
Do not leave him.	Ha ka tagin isaga.
You look beautiful.	Waxaad u egtahay qurux.
I think that's more likely.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi u badan tahay.
Now tell everyone.	Hadda qof walba u sheeg.
This was awful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
No one wanted to know.	Qofna ma rabin inuu wax ogaado.
So far, so much better.	Ilaa hadda, ka sii fiican.
Please, please, please.	Fadlan, fadlan, fadlan.
It would be interesting to see what he would do.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh in la arko waxa uu samayn doono.
No problem here.	Wax dhib ah halkan ma jiro.
Even now he could not stop.	Xitaa hadda wuu joojin waayay.
One was only once.	Mid ka mid ah wuxuu ahaa kaliya hal mar.
Maybe this has something to do with it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay wax ku leedahay.
There was nothing good about lying.	Ma jirin wax wanaagsan oo been ah.
It is best not to tell anyone.	Waxaa fiican inaadan cidna u sheegin.
I would like to talk about it now.	Waxaan ka jeclaan lahaa hadda inaan ka hadlo.
Not often the same.	Ma badna isku mid.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
They love him very much.	Aad bay u jecel yihiin isaga.
I really hope you are happy here.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad halkan ku faraxsan tahay.
But you were one.	Laakiin mid baad u ahayd.
I don't think I can stop.	Uma eka inaan joojin karo.
You can do as many times as you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa inta jeer ee aad rabto.
It is not something that is going on.	Ma aha wax socda.
There is nothing to do.	Wax la sameeyo ma jiraan.
But so far no.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma jirto.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
A lot of it was like that to me.	In badan oo ka mid ah waxay ila ahayd sidaas.
Always, and again.	Had iyo jeer, iyo mar kale.
And, of course, everything is fine.	Oo, hubaal, wax walba waa fiican yihiin.
Didn't hear how.	Ma maqlay sida loo.
I was there to eat.	Waxaan u joogay inaan wax cuno.
We cannot win.	Ma guulaysan karno.
I would love to see more	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan arko
It was taken immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayaa loo qaaday.
Where found.	Halka laga helay.
But that doesn’t do anything.	Laakiin taas waxba kuma sameeyo.
You can actually do this if you want.	Dhab ahaantii waad samayn kartaa tan haddii aad rabto.
That could be you.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa adiga.
She can do that.	Way samayn kartaa taas.
Maybe a good person.	Malaha qof wanaagsan.
You can't get that from anyone else.	Taas qof kale kama heli kartid.
You couldn’t see much.	Wax badan ma aad arki karin.
It can be very good.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
That he never has, he will never do.	In uusan waligiis haysan, waligiis ma yeeli doono.
Bad, bad idea.	Xun, fikrad xun.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
Tell him again.	Mar kale oo aad u sheegto isaga.
I was surprised by that.	Waxaan la yaabay taas.
But I need something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaan u baahanahay.
But that is the only reason.	Laakiin taasi waa sababta kaliya.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
After all, it’s just a matter of urgency.	Had iyo jeer, kaliya waa mid degdeg ah.
And fast.	Oo degdeg ah.
They both do.	Labaduba way sameeyaan.
.	.
There are several.	Waxaa jira dhowr ka mid ah.
He wanted someone to get it from him.	Waxa uu rabay in qof ka helo isaga.
This is really something.	Tani runtii waa wax.
He had to find out if they were like him.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado inay isaga la mid yihiin iyo in kale.
It has never been so.	Weligay sidaas ma ahaan jirin.
I didn't want to know.	Maan rabin inaan ogaado.
I know he lives, somewhere.	Waan ogahay inuu ku nool yahay, meel.
He picked it up.	Wuu soo qaaday.
I won't see much.	Wax badan ma arki doono.
I didn't have time for that.	Waqti uma helin taas.
She gave nothing else.	Wax kale ma aysan siin.
I'm sure I'm sorry about that.	Waan hubaa taas waan ka xumahay.
He should have known better.	Waxa ay ahayd in uu taas ka sii ogaado.
Something real known.	Wax dhab ah oo la yaqaan.
I wondered what we were doing.	Waxaan la yaabay waxa aan samayno.
But that is everything.	Laakiin taasi waa wax walba.
But what we need is much bigger.	Laakiin waxa aan u baahanahay ayaa aad uga weyn.
Truly, it is beautiful.	Runtii, way qurux badan tahay.
Not sure how little	Ma hubo inta yar
But it is not over yet.	Laakiin weli ma uu dhammaan.
He wants to buy it.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ka iibsado.
This would not be so bad.	Tani ma ahaan lahayd mid sidaas u xun.
It was really fun.	Waxay ahayd xiiso dhab ah.
I'll talk to you later	dib ayaan kula hadli doonaa
It was all very interesting.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
But he says there is no chance.	Laakiin wuxuu leeyahay fursad ma jirto.
Both are required.	Labaduba isku mid ayaa loo baahan yahay.
And more, and more, and more.	Iyo in ka badan, iyo ka badan, iyo in ka badan.
But it is not.	Laakiin ma aha.
But that is still too much.	Laakiin taasi weli aad bay u badan tahay.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
But really, it is not.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
I really didn’t know what to do with it.	Runtii ma garanayn waxaan ku sameeyo.
Maybe I should.	Malaha waa inaan.
I can't tell you anymore.	Mar dambe ma kuu sheegi karo.
Someone else promised me.	Qof kale ayaa la ii ballan qaaday.
One small.	Mid yar.
A few years at home.	Dhowr sano oo guriga ah.
This was his favorite place at home.	Tani waxay ahayd meesha uu ugu jecel yahay guriga.
I felt at home.	Waxaan dareemay in aan guriga joogo.
Everyone loves it.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay.
This was too long.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer.
Since, there is nothing wrong with that.	Tan, ma jiraan wax aan isku mid ahayn.
tell me .	ii sheeg .
It was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u qurux badan, wax aad u qurux badan.
I look forward to tonight.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in aan caawa.
But I'm still not sure.	Laakiin weli ma hubo.
Like, that's something new.	Sida, taasi waa wax cusub.
But you can't stop.	Laakiin ma joojin kartid.
He won’t even be able to be any other.	Xitaa ma awoodi doono inuu si kale noqdo.
Really, really happy.	Runtii, runtii aad u faraxsan.
I never went there.	Weligay halkaas ma tagin.
I liked it a lot.	Wax badan ayaan ka helay.
I was lucky.	Waxaan ahaa mid nasiib badan.
He has a job.	Shaqo ayuu leeyahay.
Things they can't say.	Waxyaabo aanay ku odhan karin.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
I am all real.	Dhammaan anigu dhab baan ahay.
He was a very smart man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin caqli badan.
I have to know it better.	Waa inaan si fiican u garanayaa.
A lot in it	Wax badan oo ku jira
An adult.	Qof weyn.
Not all.	Dhammaan maaha.
I know a lot about him.	Wax badan ayaan ka garanayaa isaga.
Well, it's even harder.	Way, way ka sii adag tahay.
And not just you.	Oo adiga kaliya maaha.
And now very little has been taken.	Oo hadda aad u yar ayaa la qaatay.
I just can't see.	Kaliya ma arki karo.
I don't have time.	Waqti ma hayo.
I went back to the wrong place.	Waxaan ku noqday meel xun.
I can't go to him.	Ma tagi karo isaga.
I didn’t think this was going to happen anytime soon.	Uma malaynayn inay tani noqon doonto dhawaan.
It is difficult to see otherwise.	Way adag tahay in si kale loo arko.
I am not that.	Anigu taas kama ihi.
I'll tell you why.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa sababta.
What you did tonight.	Wixii aad caawa samaysay.
I didn't want to do it.	Ma rabin inaan sameeyo.
And they are likely to leave.	Oo waxay u badan tahay inay ka bixi doonaan.
That really isn’t long.	Taasi runtii wakhti dheer maaha.
This does not seem like a big deal.	Tani uma eka wax weyn.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay .
People in need.	Dadka u baahan.
That's what you did.	Sidaas ayaad samaysay.
He came home.	Wuxuu yimid guriga.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi sidaas maaha.
You will stay here	Halkan ayaad joogi doontaa
Give until tomorrow.	Sii ilaa berri.
It is more difficult than anything.	Wax walba way ka adag tahay.
But we do not do this.	Laakiin tan ma samayno.
They are so big.	Aad bay u weyn yihiin.
I hope he is happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu faraxsan yahay.
Now he is constantly on the move.	Hadda si joogto ah ayuu u baxay.
Do not say anything.	Waxba ha odhan.
The reason for this.	Sababta tan.
It may be very difficult to find.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u adag tahay in la helo.
And you do not want to know.	Oo ma rabto inaad ogaato.
But no one was there.	Laakiin qofna ma jirin.
And a little happier.	Iyo in yar oo faraxsan.
That’s a bit of hard work right there.	Taasi waa xoogaa shaqo adag ah isla halkaas.
For this you need some strength.	Tan waxaad u baahan tahay xoogaa awoodo ah.
He is now one of us.	Hadda waa mid naga mid ah.
You can't leave now.	Hadda ma bixi kartid.
I need one more person.	Waxaan u baahanahay hal qof oo kale.
But this does not seem to be the case.	Laakiin tani uma eka inay sax tahay.
Tonight it looked beautiful.	Caawa waxa uu u muuqday mid qurux badan.
More is coming.	Wax badan ayaa soo socda.
And to be with you.	Iyo inaan kula joogo.
That is really old.	Taasi runtii waa hore.
You will give me that.	Waad i siin doontaa taas.
Not only that.	Ma aha oo kaliya.
I have no food.	Cunto ma haysto.
I need to tell you something else.	Waxaan u baahanahay in aan kuu sheego wax kale.
This is clearly a constant.	Tani waxay si cad u tahay mid joogto ah.
I didn't see anything, really.	Waxba ma arag, dhab ahaantii.
Anyone can go home.	Qof kastaa wuu tagi karaa guriga.
I don't want to do too much about it.	Ma rabo inaan wax badan ka sameeyo.
You know they don't take this well.	Waad ogtahay inaysan si fiican u qaadan tan.
Obviously, this is a bad thing.	Sida cad, tani waa wax xun.
I am really happy to talk to you.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan la hadlo.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
But it is a great place.	Laakiin waa meel weyn.
I said nothing.	Waxba kuma odhan.
But he is more than that.	Laakiin wuu ka sii badan yahay.
What, who knows.	Waa maxay, yaa yaqaan.
That is just me.	Taasi waa aniga kaliya.
Like everyone else.	Sida qof kasta oo kale.
I am ready for it	diyaar ayaan u ahay
But not anymore.	Laakiin mar dambe maaha.
More so, even.	Si ka sii badan, xitaa.
I would definitely do more.	Hubaal wax badan ayaan ka qaban lahaa.
He wondered if that was the case with everyone.	Waxa uu is waydiiyay in ay sidaas tahay qof walba.
I still think that is true.	Weli waxaan qabaa inay taasi run tahay.
Otherwise please let me know.	Haddii kale fadlan ii sheeg.
Not as a man.	Nin ahaan maaha.
Very beautiful, very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan, aad u qurux badan.
But you don't have to worry about that.	Laakiin uma baahnid wax dhib ah taas.
I don't feel like I need to say much.	Ma dareemayo inaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan sheego.
That is the same as before.	Taasi waa sidii hore.
To find out.	Si aad wax u ogaato.
I think they are very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u fiican yihiin.
Don't do that !.	Ha samayn taas!.
Problem but not.	Dhibaato laakiin ma ahayn.
What would come.	Maxaa iman lahaa.
I knew something about him.	Wax baan ka ogaa isaga.
It was very good before.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan ka hor.
I am this	waxaan ahay kan
He would love to see you.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu ku arko.
We will only see this.	Waxaan kaliya arki doonaa arrintan.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ma uu rabin inuu ila hadlo.
He knew you would come back.	Wuu ogaa inaad soo noqon doonto.
This can be undesirable.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aan la rabin.
I have something to tell you one day.	Waxaan hayaa wax aan kuu sheego maalin.
Only when they do to you, you know.	Kaliya marka ay kugu sameeyaan, waad ogtahay.
I would love to be there to see it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas u joogo si aan u arko.
I had to be there.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas joogo.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
Just stop, again.	Kaliya jooji, mar dambe.
Like when he eats.	Sida marka uu wax cuno.
Everyone will see.	Qof kastaa wuu arki doonaa.
It looks so bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xun.
He really tried to help.	Runtii wuxuu isku dayay inuu caawiyo.
A lot has come out of it.	Wax badan baa ka soo baxay.
He seemed to reject something.	Waxa uu u muuqday in uu diiday wax.
I reported.	waan soo sheegay.
He came out.	Wuu ka soo baxay.
She was very smart.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u caqli badan.
But it is beautiful.	Laakiin way qurux badan tahay.
It didn't help.	Ma aysan caawin.
He has to go.	Waa inuu iska tago.
I just lost my job.	Kaliya waxaan waayay shaqada.
It will not get better over time.	Waqti ka dib ma fiicnaan doonto.
Now he is sure.	Hadda wuu hubaa.
It can be almost.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax ku dhow.
Too much, too good.	Aad u badan, aad u fiican.
This was a blatant lie.	Tani waxay ahayd been cad.
Three problems occurred.	Saddex dhibaato ayaa dhacay.
I tried to find it.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo.
That is true, and true.	Taasi waa run, oo sax ah.
This cannot be good.	Tani ma fiicnaan karto.
A friend is missing.	Waa la waayay saaxiib.
But he thought he knew.	Laakiin wuxuu mooday inuu garanayo.
This is not correct.	Tani sax uma eka.
I am the only one	aniga kaliya ayaan ahay
You will need more than ever.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa in ka badan sidii hore.
He entered the place.	Meesha ayuu ka galay.
It just can't be that way.	Kaliya sidaas ma ahaan karo.
Doing this would be difficult.	In tan la sameeyo waxay ahaan lahayd mid adag.
They are in dire need of it.	Aad bay ugu baahan yihiin.
I don’t even talk to him.	Xitaa lama hadlo isaga.
He was only three.	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya saddex.
As if there were none.	Sida in aanay jirin.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas .
As he looked.	Sida uu u eegay.
It was like everything else.	Waxay ahayd sida wax kasta oo kale.
It's all clear.	Waa wada cad.
As always.	Sida had iyo jeer.
Here, you will have the opportunity to help.	Halkan, waxaad heli doontaa fursad aad ku caawiso.
You don't have to do anything.	Ma aha inaad wax samayso.
I definitely don't think so.	Hubaal uma malaynayo taas.
It was a great time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti aad u fiican.
There really was nothing there.	Dhab ahaantii ma jirin wax halkaas ah.
It was awful to see.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun in la arko.
I really didn't want anything.	Runtii waxba maan rabin.
It is too bad he is alive.	Aad bay u xun tahay inuu nool yahay.
I wonder if someone is living now.	Waxaan la yaabanahay in qof hadda ku nool yahay.
He wants to work hard.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu si adag u shaqeeyo.
This told me something.	Tani wax bay ii sheegtay.
Like a man.	Sida nin.
I'm sure I didn't do anything about it.	Waxaan hubaa inaanan waxba ka qaban.
If he did, he would surely succeed.	Haddii uu taas sameeyo, waxa hubaal ah in uu guulaysan lahaa.
It will be gone.	Waa la tagi doonaa.
Something really amazing is going on here.	Wax runtii la yaab leh ayaa halkan ka socda.
I will come to you.	waan kuu iman doonaa.
I didn't have to come back.	Ma ahayn inaan soo noqdo.
Work, work.	Shaqo, shaqo.
The cause is still unknown.	Sababta ilaa hadda lama garanayo.
I could not say why.	Ma sheegi karin sababta.
I am just	waxaan ahay kaliya
It was a nice little surprise.	Waxay ahayd yaab yar oo fiican.
Stop this now.	Hadda jooji tan hadda.
Just a little while	Kaliya waqti yar
I had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin.
What we do is right.	Wax aan samayno waa sax.
You can't do that anywhere.	Taas meel kasta kuma samayn kartid.
Good friend.	Saaxiib wanaagsan.
I think it would be.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan lahayd.
I don't have to keep you.	Ma aha inaan ku sii hayo.
It was everything a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wax walba waqti dheer ka hor.
I am a great man.	Waxaan ahay nin weyn.
Whatever you have to do.	Wax kasta oo ay tahay inaad sameyso.
After all there was nothing lacking to do.	Ka dib oo dhan ma jirin wax la'aan ah oo la sameeyo.
I need to get there first.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan marka hore halkaas tago.
Only man.	Kaliya nin.
Maybe she still wants to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli rabto.
There are several such.	Waxaa jira dhowr sida.
That was once and for all.	Taasi waxay ahayd hal mar oo aad u badan.
Got a job.	Shaqo helay.
I have never had another job.	Weligay shaqo kale maan helin.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
But he has to do other things as well.	Laakiin waa inuu sidoo kale sameeyo waxyaabo kale.
To lie.	Inuu been u sheego.
A lot has happened here.	Wax badan ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
That was untrue.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan run ahayn.
I am not the youngest.	Ma ihi kan yar.
He came to do it.	Wuxuu u yimid inuu sameeyo.
Obviously this is too big for one person.	Waxaa cad in tani ay aad ugu weyn tahay hal qof.
That is because they are very new.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah aad bay u cusub yihiin.
I need someone here	Waxaan u baahanahay qof halkan
But he knows how much I think.	Laakiin wuu garanayaa inta ay aniga ila tahay.
I will do the same.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa sidaas oo kale.
That every day is so much more.	In maalin kasta ay sidaas u badan tahay.
I still don't really understand how.	Wali si dhab ah uma fahmin sida.
Something would have been done there.	Wax baa halkaas lagu samayn lahaa.
Not if.	Ma aha haddii.
I went to him.	Waan u tagay.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu la joogo.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
He was so beautiful.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u qurux badan.
But you can't always win.	Laakiin ma guulaysan kartid mar kasta.
They will not.	Ma samayn doonaan.
She would give that.	Way siin lahayd taas.
Let me tell you.	Aan kuu sheego .
But that is the only thing that exists.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa kaliya ee jira.
Much known, really.	Wax badan oo la yaqaan, runtii.
He was not there and he knew.	Ma jirin oo wuu ogaa.
Waa ha ha ha !.	Waa ha ha ha!.
That was quick.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
We are ready for a long day's work.	Waxaan diyaar u nahay shaqo maalin dheer.
That would be a great place to shop.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd meel fiican oo wax laga iibsado.
That's fine.	Taasi waa iska fiican tahay.
After all, he would still be here.	Ka dib oo dhan, weli wuu joogi lahaa halkan.
It could be him.	Waxay noqon kartaa isaga.
There is not much	Ma jirto wax badan
Very fast, very fast.	Aad u degdeg badan, aad u degdeg badan.
It will be you.	Waxaad noqon doontaa adiga.
I knew what was coming.	Waan ogaa waxa soo socda.
That was all she had to say.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee ay odhan lahayd.
Really good.	Runtii aad u fiican.
It's hard, but it's true.	Way adag tahay, laakiin waa run.
He can do whatever he wants.	Wax kasta oo uu doono wuu samayn karaa.
Maybe it's still the best for me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay weli aniga ugu fiican.
But, so, very interesting.	Laakiin, si, aad u xiiso badan.
This is done.	Tani waa la sameeyay.
You can do better than that.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka wanaagsan taas.
But just let me know if you need anything.	Laakiin kaliya ii soo sheeg haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
You may not understand this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan fahmin tan.
I need to do better than this.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo wax ka fiican tan.
Now it's the bad one.	Hadda waa kan xun.
He did more.	Wax ka badan ayuu sameeyay.
But let me tell you something.	Laakiin aan wax kuu sheego.
Very bad bad.	Aad u xun xun.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
I'm sure it's right.	Waan hubaa inay sax tahay.
To help me.	Si aad ii caawiso.
As you are.	Sida aad tahay.
I am the same.	anigu isku mid ayaan ahay.
But we can't keep it here.	Laakiin halkan kuma haysan karno.
What three.	Waa maxay saddex.
No one here knows how to do it.	Qofna halkan ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo.
I was unable to do so.	Ma awoodin in aan sameeyo.
In fact, it is much more difficult than that.	Dhab ahaantii, aad bay uga dhib badan tahay taas.
No one can help.	Qofna ma caawin karo.
Whatever you need, he can get it.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay, wuu heli karaa.
Something like that might be really true.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ayaa laga yaabaa runtii run.
Now I am good	Hadda waxaan ahay mid wanaagsan
He could not be more happy.	Ma uu noqon karin mid aad ugu faraxsan.
Probably, one place.	Malaha, hal meel.
It has been known for some time now.	Waa la yaqaan in muddo ah hadda.
Nothing too difficult.	Wax aad u adag ma jiraan.
As it was.	Sida ay ahayd.
We were just.	Waxaan ahayn kaliya.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
He was everything to me.	Wax walba ayuu ii ahaa.
But it can really be, it can be anyone.	Laakiin runtii way noqon kartaa, waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
No one can believe it is true.	Qofna ma rumaysan karo inay run tahay.
But I can't get to work.	Laakiin ma heli karo in aan shaqeeyo.
That is the only way it will happen.	Taasi waa sida kaliya ee ay ku dhici lahayd.
I love learning	Waxaan jeclahay inaan wax barto
I think it's true.	Waxaan filayaa inay run tahay.
This is a great place to be.	Tani waa meel aad u fiican oo la joogo.
This is a very long time.	Tani waa wakhti aad u dheer.
I do not know what to do.	Anigu ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
If she loved you, she would love you.	Haddii ay ku jeceshahay, way jeclaan lahayd.
Maybe he still gets it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli helo.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Kaliya ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo.
Beautiful day.	Maalin qurux badan.
He came to help.	Wuxuu u yimid inuu caawiyo.
It can be great.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn.
It is unthinkable.	Maaha wax la malayn karo.
Whoever it is, it is the same.	Qof kasta oo ay tahay, waa isku mid.
If not, you can do something else.	Haddii aysan ahayn, wax kale ayaad samayn kartaa.
But you know she loves you more than anything.	Laakiin waad ogtahay inay wax walba kaa jeceshahay.
This will end.	Tani way dhammaan doontaa.
I really don't understand.	Runtii ma fahmin.
I would expect him.	Waxaan ka filan lahaa isaga.
There isn’t much.	Ma jiraan wax aad u badan.
.	.
It will not hurt you.	Waxba ku yeeli maayo.
I want to know if he was surprised to see me or not.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado inuu la yaabay inuu i arko iyo in kale.
And they are so beautiful.	Oo aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
I hope she does.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sameyso.
That was one.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid.
I had to do it better.	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga si ka wanaagsan u sameeyo.
Not one.	Mid maaha.
There has never been such a thing before.	Wax la mid ah hore ma jirin.
It looks great.	Waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
It can help	Way ku caawin kartaa
They really like it.	Runtii way jecel yihiin.
To find out where he went and why.	Si loo ogaado halka uu aaday iyo sababta.
One made for me.	Mid la ii sameeyay.
I still haven't found it.	Wali maan helin.
I still have it today.	Ilaa maanta waan hayaa.
He did not understand what had happened to him.	Ma uu fahmin waxa ku soo dhacay.
It was everything.	Waxay ahayd wax walba.
It was a lot.	Wax badan bay ahayd.
You, with me.	Adiga, ila leh.
I felt it again.	Mar kale ayaan dareemay.
Let everyone know what they know.	Qof kastaa wuxuu yaqaan ha sheego.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
I'll talk about it.	Waan ka hadli doonaa.
Tell them what you want.	U sheeg waxaad rabto.
He was very young, after all.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u yar, ka dib oo dhan.
No wonder why.	La yaab ma leh sababta.
I don't want to do anything with this.	Ma doonayo inaan wax ku sameeyo tan.
It will take time to find out for sure.	Waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti in la ogaado hubaal.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
He decided not to say anything.	Waxa uu go'aansaday in aanu waxba odhan.
I will never allow that.	Weligay ma ogolaan doono taas.
There is nothing else going on.	Wax kale oo socda ma jiraan.
That sounds familiar.	Taasi waxay u egtahay in la yaqaan.
That is not interesting.	Taasi ma ahan mid xiiso badan.
But, yesterday was a good day for me.	Laakiin, shalay waxay ii ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
He loves people.	Dadka wuu jecel yahay.
Maybe it was too much.	Malaha waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
Everyone wants it.	Qof kastaa wuu rabaa.
It is not something we can take for granted.	Ma ahan wax aan iska qaadan karno.
It was not money.	Ma ahayn lacag.
I am very skeptical of that.	Aad ayaan uga shakisanahay taas.
He will come.	Wuu iman doonaa.
We were robbed.	Waa nala dhacay.
Unless they go back to prison.	Waa haddii aanay dib ugu noqon xabsiga.
I'm sure I won't.	Waan hubaa in aanan yeeli doonin.
Not sure what it is.	Ma hubo waxa ay tahay.
It cannot be done.	Lama qaban karo.
They are bad.	Way xun yihiin.
The same is not true here.	Isla sidaas oo kale maaha run halkan.
I don't see anything big.	Ma arko wax weyn.
That is really the reason.	Taasi waa runtii sababta.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
It was great for me to see you	Aad bay ii ahayd inaan ku arko
If available, we will receive it.	Haddii la heli karo, waanu heli doonaa.
It really is the only thing out there.	Dhab ahaantii waa waxa kaliya ee halkaas ka jira.
He really didn't like it.	Runtii ma uu jeclayn.
I should love to know what it is.	Waa inaan jeclahay inaan ogaado waxa ay tahay.
But there was no way he was alone.	Laakiin ma jirto si uu keligiis ugu jiray.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
In tan si.	In tan si.
I look forward to working with him.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan la shaqeeyo isaga.
It was not yesterday.	Shalay ma jirin.
I do, one.	Waxaan sameeyaa, hal.
I wonder, really, how you can make one.	Waxaan la yaabanahay, runtii, sida aad mid u yeeli karto.
One came to him.	Mid baa u yimid.
But he was here.	Laakiin halkan ayuu joogay.
People going to work.	Dadka u socda shaqada.
Much has been said.	Wax badan baa la yidhi.
He'll get it right.	Waxa uu heli doonaa in ay sax.
But that is not what it is.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ay tahay.
Very amazing, very beautiful !.	Aad u yaab badan, aad u qurux badan!.
Something better has always come out.	Wax ka fiican ayaa had iyo jeer soo baxay.
You are all together.	Adiga oo dhan baad wada.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
You did it all.	Waad wada samaysay.
You can.	Waad awoodi kartaa.
I felt she would come back.	Waxaan dareemay in ay soo noqon doonto.
That was a bad thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax xun.
Not everyone is like that.	Qof walba sidaas uma aha.
Now I'm back here.	Hadda halkan ayaan ku soo noqday.
But that’s just me.	Laakiin taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
Little was seen.	Wax yar baa la arki jiray.
Not really a big deal.	Runtii wax weyn maaha.
I haven't seen anything else before.	Wax kale maan arag markii hore.
This is not the best thing you can do.	Tani ma waxa ugu fiican ee aad samayn karto.
"Let me see," he said.	Aan arko ayuu yidhi.
I never talked about it.	Weligay maan ka hadlin.
How beautiful they are.	Sidee u qurux badan yihiin.
I can clearly see.	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Malaha, laakiin malaha.
You cannot let him do this.	Uma ogolaan kartid inuu tan sameeyo.
I don’t want to see this, ever.	Ma rabo inaan tan arko, weligay.
No one is happy, but no one can do anything.	Qof faraxsan ma jiro, laakiin qofna waxba kama qaban karo.
I think he will.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu sameyn doono.
You cannot do this alone.	Tani ma samayn kartid keligaa.
I have to be very happy.	Waa inaan aad u faraxsanahay.
He just needs a chance.	Kaliya wuxuu u baahan yahay fursad.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
But there was nothing else to do.	Laakiin ma jirin wax kale oo la sameeyo.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
It was so good.	Waxay ahayd inay aad u fiican tahay.
I started with nothing.	Waxaan ku bilaabay waxba.
But you have another one.	Laakiin mid kale ayaad leedahay.
A long time ago, really.	Waqti hore, dhab ahaantii.
I do not lie.	Been ma sheego.
That's right.	Waa sax.
It is something new	Waa wax cusub
I would love to be here to see this one.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan u joogo inuu kan arko.
At least for me.	Inta ugu yar aniga.
I say maybe.	Waxaan leeyahay malaha.
Maybe there was nothing wrong with him.	Malaha waxba kuma jirin isaga.
I wasn’t there, after all.	Maan joogin, ka dib oo dhan.
I need a good place to be	Waxaan u baahanahay meel fiican oo aan joogo
And, of course, it is.	Iyo, dhab ahaantii, waa.
It's a great place.	Waa meel fiican.
This was a terrible problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhibaato aad u xun.
It was again.	Waxay ahayd mar kale.
Don't tell me anything else.	Wax kale ha ii sheegin.
I was lucky to have it there before.	Nasiib badan ayaan halkaas hore ugu lahaa.
I really should.	Runtii waa inaan.
I will do this again.	Mar kale ayaan tan samayn doonaa.
I asked him to leave.	Waxaan ka codsaday inuu baxo.
That is like him.	Taasi waa isaga oo kale.
We need all the rest we can get.	Waxaan u baahanahay dhammaan inta kale ee aan heli karno.
I think it was awful.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd wax aad u xun.
It can be anyone, anywhere.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta, meel kasta.
I have to go for something to eat.	Waa inaan aado wax aan cuno.
But they would not see that.	Laakiin taasi ma ay arki doonin.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn.
Someone else did.	Qof kale ayaa sameeyay.
Anyone can leave anyone.	Qof kasta wuu ka tagi karaa qof kasta.
Most of the time, you can’t get that.	Inta badan, taas ma heli kartid.
But, there is a lot going on.	Laakiin, waxaa jira wax badan oo socda.
I will do it later	mar dambe ayaan samayn doonaa
I got the best.	Waxaan helay waxa ugu fiican.
It is a very clear idea.	Waa fikrad aad u cad.
He is a real person.	Waa qof dhab ah.
He also looked surprised.	Waxa kale oo uu u muuqday mid la yaabay.
It was very clear and very clear.	Waxay ahayd mid cad oo aad u cad.
He knew a lot.	Wax badan buu ogaa.
That is now to be expected.	Taasi hadda waa la filayaa.
I got there	Meesha waan ka helay
I need more.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan.
I suspect they exist.	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inay jiraan.
I will just do that.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa kaliya taas.
What happened was not you.	Waxa dhacay adiga ma ahayn.
That may not be the case.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan taasi ahayn.
He said he had.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu lahaa.
Maybe too bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u xun.
This is not very good.	Tani maaha mid aad u fiican.
More new things are coming.	Waxyaabo badan oo cusub ayaa soo socda.
They are so bad.	Aad bay u xun yihiin.
He must be lying.	Waa inuu been yahay.
It's all new.	Dhammaan waa wax cusub.
He is the one who left me.	Waa kii iga tagay.
He liked that.	Taas ayuu ka helay.
Maybe he did.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidaas sameeyay.
I just did.	Kaliya waan sameeyay.
Maybe it could be too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale noqon karo.
Not like the previous one.	Ma aha sidii kii hore.
No one else spoke.	Qof kale ma hadlin.
Only now a little too hard.	Kaliya hadda in yar oo aad u adag.
He really wanted to leave.	Dhab ahaantii wuxuu rabay inuu ka baxo.
Nothing hard was found.	Ma jirin wax adag oo la helay.
I just took it.	Kaliya waan ka qaaday.
Everyone is very good.	Qof walba aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
It’s so much one day.	Waa wax aad u badan hal maalin.
That is very good.	Taasi waa mid aad u fiican.
Probably less than three.	Malaha in ka yar saddex.
Not sure where to go.	Ma hubo meel aan aado.
Very, very real.	Aad iyo aad u dhab ah.
I have never seen anything.	Weligay waxba maan arag.
No one knows what it is.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa uu yahay.
This is very bad, and it is bad over time.	Tani waa wax aad u xun, iyo waxa xun waqti.
It belongs to you.	Adiga ayaa iska leh.
That is, but it is also a lot.	Taasi waa, laakiin sidoo kale waa wax aad u badan.
You can stay home.	Waxaad joogi kartaa guriga.
He should not have done so.	Ma ahayn inuu sidaas sameeyo.
You do not have to lie.	Ma aha inaad been sheegto.
If you did, you would be telling the truth.	Haddii aad samayso, run baad u sheegi lahayd.
This is a terrible thing.	Tani waa wax aad u xun.
We will see what happens next.	Waan arki doonaa waxa soo socda.
I felt that no one could find me.	Waxaan dareemay in qofna i heli karin.
And left me.	Oo iga tagay.
It's hard to do.	Waa wax adag in la sameeyo.
That is what the adult does.	Taasi waa waxa qofka weyn uu sameeyo.
I think it would have been so much better.	Waxa aan filayaa in ay sidaas uga sii fiicnaan lahayd.
I wanted to do it right.	Waxaan rabay inaan si sax ah u sameeyo.
So far, he is a good friend, as of now.	Ilaa hadda, waa saaxiib wanaagsan, sida hadda.
The best available.	Sida ugu fiican ee la heli karo.
She had many friends there.	Waxay halkaas ku lahayd saaxiibo badan.
In a few years everything is great.	Dhowr sano wax walba waa weyn yihiin.
How good for him.	Sidee u fiican isaga.
I will always love him.	Had iyo jeer waan jeclaan doonaa isaga.
But this is definitely not true.	Laakiin hubaal tani run maaha.
You certainly are.	Waa hubaal inaad tahay.
She said she was not ready.	Waxay sheegtay inaysan diyaar u ahayn.
It doesn't have to do well.	Ma aha in ay wax wanaagsan samayn lahayd.
He will be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
No one saw anything.	Qofna waxba ma arag.
That is, if you do nothing about it.	Taasi waa, haddii aadan waxba ka qaban.
But for others it cannot happen.	Laakiin dadka kale ma dhici karto.
Not that they really believe it.	Ma aha in ay dhab ahaantii rumaysan yihiin.
I have done it before.	Mar hore ayaan sameeyay.
He can do a lot.	Wax badan ayuu samayn karaa.
I want to learn more about what he does.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sii barto waxa uu sameeyo.
Not a good idea.	Ma aha fikrad wanaagsan.
Just not sure what.	Kaliya ma hubo waxa.
Too much money.	Lacag aad u badan.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
This seems familiar.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
What does that say.	Maxay taasi leedahay.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
It's really not a problem.	Runtii dhib maaha.
It was so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas .
You were fast.	Waxaad ahayd si degdeg ah.
I do, a lot.	Waxaan sameeyaa, aad u badan.
No one has a problem with that.	Qofna dhib kuma qabo taas.
I can't figure out why.	Ma awoodo inaan ogaado sababta ay taasi tahay.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
That's really bad.	Taasi runtii waa wax xun.
No one really knew.	Runtii qofna ma ogayn.
As if she could see me.	Sidii inay i arki karto.
In fact, it is very small.	Runtii, aad buu u yar yahay.
It does not work	Ma shaqeeyo
This sounds like a lot of trouble at work.	Tani waxay u egtahay dhibaato badan oo shaqada ah.
He is a real person.	Waa qof dhab ah.
Over time they will get better.	Waqti ka dib way fiicnaan doonaan.
Don't be beautiful.	Ha noqon mid qurux badan.
I have to work	Waa inaan shaqeeyo
It is a very difficult job for him.	Waa shaqo aad u adag isaga.
But this is not surprising.	Laakiin tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
I found the whole house.	Waxaan ka helay guriga oo dhan.
Who owns us.	Yaa noo leh.
He always did that.	Mar walba taas buu samayn jiray.
Still, enough is enough.	Weli, ku filan ayaa ku filan.
They still love me.	Wali way i jecel yihiin.
Anyone can tell anyone, at any time.	Qof kastaa wuu u sheegi karaa qof kasta, wakhti kasta.
But he tried.	Laakiin wuu isku dayay.
Not half a ton.	Ma rabin tan.
We will find him.	Waanu heli doonaa isaga.
He heard it again.	Mar kale ayuu maqlay.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani run maaha.
It would have won him over.	Way ku guulaysan lahayd isaga.
I didn't see one coming.	Ma arag mid soo socda.
It could not be, but it was there.	Ma ay noqon karin, laakiin waxay ahayd halkaas.
He would do everything and everything for me.	Wax walba iyo wax walba wuu ii samayn lahaa.
I would like to talk about this.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arrintan ka hadlo.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I think he is in trouble.	Waxaan filayaa inuu dhib ku jiro.
A little better.	In yar oo ka fiican.
He still wondered.	Weli wuu is yaabay.
You will see him.	Waad arki doontaa isaga.
I came back	waan soo noqday
In person.	Qof ahaan.
So far it has not been successful.	Ilaa hadda kuma guulaysan.
It was a good place.	Waxay ahayd meel wanaagsan.
That was a given.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax la siiyay.
I suspect you probably do.	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inay u badan tahay inaad sameyso.
Which really is it too.	Taas oo runtii sidoo kale ah.
But there was no car.	Laakiin ma jirin baabuur.
No problems were reported.	Wax dhibaato ah oo la sameeyay ma jirto.
And for the most part, that is true.	Iyo inta badan, taasi waa run.
He has many friends.	Wuxuu leeyahay saaxiibo badan.
You must have one.	Waa inaad mid leedahay.
So many things.	Waxyaabo aad u badan.
And maybe more than once.	Oo laga yaabo in ka badan hal mar.
But a good one.	Laakiin mid wanaagsan.
She thinks that.	Waxay u malaynaysaa in.
Just stop already.	Kaliya jooji mar hore.
Not sure if it is.	Ma hubo inay tahay.
No one else can do it.	Qof kale ma samayn karo.
I know what it is.	Waan ogahay waxa ay tahay.
I'll be back.	Dib ayaan ugu soo noqon doonaa.
It looks beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay mid qurux badan.
But don't believe me.	Laakiin ha i rumaysan.
He was not very lucky.	Nasiib badan ma lahayn.
And it was, and it is.	Oo waxay ahayd, oo waa.
That was what he was here for.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu halkan u joogay.
I did not do this today.	Maanta tan ma samayn.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
I also want you to know that it is correct.	Waxa kale oo aan rabaa in aad ogaato in ay sax tahay.
I did not say anything like that.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah uma odhan.
This is what she has to do	Tani waa inay sameyso
This was a much bigger place.	Tani waxay ahayd meel aad uga weyn.
He just couldn't do it.	Kaliya wuu awoodi waayay inuu sameeyo.
Are you ready?	Diyaar ma u tahay?.
You cannot let them do this.	Uma ogolaan kartid inay tan sameeyaan.
Good time.	Waqti fiican.
I was everything.	Waxaan ahaa wax walba.
He really knows.	Dhab ahaantii wuu garanayaa.
This is usually all that is needed.	Tani inta badan waa waxa loo baahan yahay oo dhan.
It looks beautiful.	Waxay u egtahay qurux.
There were three men.	Waxaa jiray saddex nin.
it will come to me.	way ii iman doontaa.
I was there enough to see.	In ku filan ayaan meesha joogay si aan u arko.
He will just do it.	Kaliya wuu sameyn doonaa.
We would be in trouble.	Waxaan noqon lahayn dhibaato.
I don’t have anything like that.	Ma haysto wax la mid ah.
Someone is still in it.	Qof ayaa weli ku jira.
There may be no problem.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan jirin wax dhibaato ah.
He seemed happy to be in prison.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan in uu xabsiga ku jiro.
It turned out.	Waxaa soo baxay.
I'll see you tonight.	caawa ayaan arki doonaa.
He is very smart.	Aad buu u caqli badan yahay.
That I hope to find	In aan rajaynayo in aan helo
He was so beautiful for that.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u qurux badan taas.
You should not do anything about it.	Waa inaadan waxba ka qaban taas.
He is still alive.	Wali waa nool yahay.
He was.	Waxa uu ahaa.
It was invisible.	Waxay ahayd mid aan la arki karin.
In fact, it has already begun.	Dhab ahaantii, mar hore ayuu bilaabay.
I heard everything.	Wax walba waan maqlay.
But it can't be.	Laakiin ma noqon karto.
No one really knows that.	Qofna runtii taas ma garanayo.
Tell them you are there.	U sheeg inaad halkaas joogto.
You are close to us.	Adiga ayaa noo dhow.
Not even a little.	Xitaa wax yar maaha.
He didn't want to be here.	Ma uusan rabin inuu halkaan joogo.
But not everything.	Laakiin wax walba maaha.
She can say whatever she wants.	Waxay doonto way sheegi kartaa.
This is something new.	Tani waa wax cusub.
So you really can't do that.	Marka dhab ahaantii ma sameyn kartid taas.
That would be very difficult.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid aad u adag.
That was a good day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
It is a great opportunity for me to be here.	Waxay ii tahay fursad weyn inaan halkaan joogo.
But there are several problems here.	Laakiin waxaa jira dhowr dhibaato halkan.
He did enough.	Waxa uu sameeyay ku filan.
Very well reported.	Si aad u wanaagsan ayaa loo sheegay.
You are the only one for me.	Adiga kaliya ayaa ii ah.
But no one wants anyone to really learn.	Laakiin qofna ma rabo in qofna si dhab ah wax u barto.
I hope today is also good for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in maanta ay sidoo kale kuu fiican tahay.
Maybe you were one of them.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ka mid ahayd.
Not so, obviously.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale, iska cad.
And there was no money at all.	Oo ma jirin wax lacag ah oo dhan.
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid iska cad.
They are really happy.	Runtii aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
I really would	Runtii waan samayn lahaa
He could not tell me what he said.	Wuu ii sheegi waayay wuxuu ku yidhi.
I will never see him again.	Weligay mar dambe ma arki doono.
There has to be a place.	Waa inuu jiraa meel.
But it is also an amazing place to go.	Laakiin sidoo kale waa meel la yaab leh oo la tago.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
It was a lot.	Waxay ahayd wax badan.
This is very complicated.	Tani waa mid aad u dhib badan.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin tani maaha.
It is a real time.	Waa waqti dhab ah.
I have to do it again.	Waa inaan mar kale sameeyo.
He knew she loved him.	Wuu ogaa in ay isaga jeceshahay.
If you would like.	Haddii aad jeclaan lahayd.
I hope you can do the same.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas oo kale samayn karto.
I saw that.	Waan arkay taas.
He is the same person.	Waa isku qof.
I just don't want to go now.	Kaliya ma rabo inaan aado hadda.
Really, maybe you can help me.	Runtii, malaha waad i caawin kartaa.
It was too late.	Waxay ahayd goor dambe.
It looks like now.	Waxay u egtahay hadda.
You can see that.	Waad arki kartaa taas.
I really want to learn.	Waxaan aad u rabaa inaan barto.
It will give you interest	Waxay ku siin doontaa xiiso
Really, if you don't need me.	Runtii, haddii aadan ii baahnayn.
It was but right.	Waxay ahayd laakiin sax.
Everyone seems to know something.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu wax garanayo.
It's just not a good idea.	Kaliya maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
He wonders what it could be.	Waxa uu la yaabanahay waxa ay noqon karto.
A place to go.	Meel la aado.
You do not need a good friend.	Uma baahnid saaxiib fiican.
Still, he did.	Weli, wuu sameeyay.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, laga yaabaa, laga yaabaa.
Several men entered the room.	Dhowr nin ayaa qolka ku soo dhacay.
Understood, but very good.	La fahmin, laakiin aad u fiican.
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
You do not have to like it.	Uma baahnid inaad jeceshahay.
It looks like he couldn't stop.	Waxay u egtahay inuu joojin waayay.
You will see, it will help you.	Waad arki doontaa, way ku caawin doontaa.
This is not a new day.	Tani maaha maalin cusub.
I didn't know that.	Taas maan garanayn.
Now she says she loves it.	Hadda waxay sheegtay inay jeceshahay.
It will not be a problem.	Dhib ma noqon doono.
I didn't have to lie.	Maan haysan in aan been sheego.
But that is a false lie.	Laakiin taasi waa been aan run ahayn.
I found something else for you.	Wax kale ayaan kuu helay.
No one wants to give up everything he knows.	Qofna ma rabo inuu ka tago wax walba oo uu yaqaan.
There is something strange.	Waxaa jira wax yaab leh.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
Correct who started it.	Sax cidda bilaabay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I will find him, you will see.	Waan heli doonaa isaga, waad arki doontaa.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
That's really bad.	Runtii taasi waa wax xun.
Very bad idea.	Fikrad aad u xun.
It would be seen.	Waa la arki lahaa.
After a while, he disappeared.	Muddo ka dib, waa la waayay.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
This can be bad.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid xun.
That is not yet.	Weli taasi maaha.
This is for you all.	Tani waa adiga oo dhan.
They may not get it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan helin.
Which is probably a good thing.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay tahay wax wanaagsan.
That will not be for me.	Taasi aniga ima ahaan doonto.
We will see if that is true.	Waan arki doonaa inay taasi run tahay iyo in kale.
You were bad.	Waxaad ahayd mid xun.
This was very difficult to ascertain.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u adag in la ogaado.
You are too tall	Aad baad u dheer tahay
I am a good man.	aniga nin wanaagsan.
I always want to do something else.	Had iyo jeer waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax kale.
He looked at me everywhere but he looked at me.	Meel walba ayuu iga eegay laakiin aniga ayuu i eegay.
There are three problems.	Waxaa jira saddex dhibaato.
This is new.	Tani waa cusub.
It's good for that.	Way u fiican tahay taas.
That way you can not need.	In si aadan u baahan karin.
I just didn’t like to say.	Kaliya ma jeclayn inuu sheego.
He was here at home.	Halkan ayuu joogay guriga.
It is part of that.	Waxay ka mid tahay taas.
I could not say anything.	Waxba ma odhan karin.
They are in everyone.	Waxay ku jiraan qof walba.
It will not be again.	Mar dambe ma noqon doono.
I looked tough	Waxaan u muuqday mid adag
I saw a lot.	Wax badan ayaan arkay.
I had to do more.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax badan sameeyo.
This was very strange, very complicated.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad yaab leh, aad u dhib badan.
This was obvious and a real problem.	Tani waxay ahayd mid cad oo dhibaato dhab ah.
I think it will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
Maybe it's him.	Malaha waa isaga.
I tried to tell him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan u sheego.
Much smaller and more beautiful as well.	Si aad ah uga yar oo aad uga qurux badan sidoo kale.
I keep it there	halkaas ayaan ku hayaa
It is somewhere else.	Waa meel kale.
She was another friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib kale.
I can't believe that.	Taas ma rumaysan karo.
I didn't get much.	Wax badan ma helin.
I have to see you	waa inaan ku arko
I don't want to do it.	Ma rabo inaan sameeyo.
It's still good, but.	Weli way fiican tahay, laakiin.
I know you can do it.	Waan ogahay inaad sameyn karto.
I found one a long time ago.	Waxaan helay mid wakhti hore ka hor.
We will see more, more of this.	Waxaan arki doonaa wax badan, wax badan oo tan ah.
It was just here, now.	Waxaa jiray halkan kaliya, hadda.
Where you want to be.	Meesha aad rabto inaad ku jirto.
She can do it.	Way samayn kartaa.
But it can be better.	Laakiin waa laga fiicnaan karaa.
Nice to see you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
I want you to be with me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ila joogto.
It was that there was more than that.	Waxay ahayd in ay jiraan wax ka badan taas oo kaliya.
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
But, it does not.	Laakiin, taasi ma samayso.
She promised.	Way ballan qaaday.
Don't do this.	Ha samayn tan.
Surely that would do.	Hubaal in taasi samayn lahayd.
I have never been one.	Weligay mid ma joogin.
It was very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan.
Good thing, too.	Wax fiican, sidoo kale.
It seems timeless.	Waxay u egtahay mid aan wakhti lahayn.
He has another.	Mid kale ayuu leeyahay.
She will not do that again.	Taas hadda ka dib ma samaynayso.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha wax adag.
You can go to him.	Waad u tagi kartaa isaga.
I think it is probably.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay malaha.
In addition, it is not very common.	Waxaa dheer, aad uma badna.
he needs.	wuu u baahan yahay.
Now you can pay	Hadda waad bixin kartaa
They will find you.	Way ku heli doonaan.
I would get it	waan heli lahaa
It is very beautiful but it is a lie.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay laakiin waa been.
This is great.	Tani waa mid weyn.
It is always so.	Had iyo jeer waa sidaas oo kale.
Maybe a man.	Malaha nin.
That is until someone wants something that is nothing.	Taasi waa ilaa uu qof doonayo wax aan waxba ahayn.
Let me tell you this.	Aan kuu sheego tan.
Don't tell him.	Ha u sheegin isaga.
She needs money.	Waxay u baahan tahay lacag .
A day later.	Maalin ka dib.
It's hard to do.	Way adag tahay in la sameeyo.
He would do little.	Wax yar ayuu samayn lahaa.
But he really knows what he wants.	Laakiin runtii wuu garanayaa waxa uu rabo.
Definitely a place to be seen.	Dhab ahaantii meel lagu arko.
But it was a very interesting idea.	Laakiin waxay ahayd fikrad aad u xiiso badan.
Ima stop.	Ima joojin.
Where she is now, she did not know.	Meesha ay hadda joogto, ma ay garanayn.
But she was very clear and smart.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u cad oo caqli badan.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda waa taas.
At first nothing came of it.	Markii hore waxba kama soo bixin.
Everyone here knows that.	Qof kasta oo halkan joogaa wuu garanayaa taas.
I did.	Aniga ayaa sameeyay.
It was not so bad.	Ma ahayn sidaas u xun.
I'm glad you're beautiful.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad qurux badan tahay.
I didn't want to come back for long.	Maan doonayn inaan soo noqdo muddo dheer.
I thought it would help.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay ku caawin doonto.
He went in through the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka soo galay oo soo galay.
Not sure what that looks like yet.	Ma hubo sida ay taasi u egtahay weli.
There was nothing to talk about.	Ma jirin wax laga hadlo.
This is a big problem.	Tani waa dhibaato weyn.
Someone else got it first.	Qof kale ayaa markii hore helay.
No one knows everything.	Qofna wax walba ma yaqaan.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ma awoodo, ma awoodo, ma awoodo.
I love that, it is so beautiful.	Waan jeclahay taas, aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
No friend, really.	Ma jiro saaxiib, dhab ah.
Hold on, all.	Qabo, dhammaan.
True, not much to see.	Run, ma aha wax badan in la arko.
He is everywhere.	Meel walba wuu joogaa.
There is no way to know.	Ma jirto si uu u ogaado.
But he knew it was true.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inay run tahay.
But nothing came.	Laakiin waxba ma iman.
But that’s just me.	Laakiin taasi waa aniga kaliya.
And he began to want new things.	Oo wuxuu bilaabay inuu rabo waxyaabo cusub.
You know, if you need to.	Waad ogtahay, haddii aad u baahan tahay.
I thought you were.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay.
He would do something about it.	Wax buu ka qaban lahaa.
Not that it's a bad idea.	Ma aha in ay fikrad xun tahay.
Lots of fun.	Wax badan oo xiiso leh.
You need it	Waxaad u baahan tahay
Someone else bought it.	Qof kale ayaa iibsaday.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
But as it is still long.	Laakiin sida ay weli u dheer tahay.
I love this.	Waan jeclahay kan.
I know.	Waan garanayaa.
Not too hard, but happy all the same.	Ma aha mid aad u adag, laakiin ku faraxsan dhammaan isku mid.
No one would believe me.	Qofna ima rumaysan lahaa.
He is good at that.	Waa uu ku fiican yahay taas.
They are good for us.	Way noo fiican yihiin.
Everyone will tell you.	Qof walba ayaa kuu sheegi doona.
Everyone wants money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa lacag.
It's not pretty.	Ma ahan wax qurux badan.
I think it is still new.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in ay wali tahay mid cusub.
It is supposed to.	Waa loo malaynayaa.
Don't tell anyone.	Cidna ha u sheegin.
She had to be told.	Waxay ahayd in loo sheego.
We will do it.	Waanu samayn doonaa .
But no one talked much.	Laakiin qofna wax badan kama hadlin.
It is a solid food.	Waa cunto adag.
And as he said, it will be.	Oo sida uu yidhi, way ahaan doontaa.
It just won’t happen.	Kaliya ma dhici doonto.
I'm sorry about what happened.	Waan ka xumahay wixii dhacay.
Take what you can get.	Qaado waxa aad heli karto.
She was obviously a good person.	Sida cad waxay ahayd qof wanaagsan.
This is just me.	Tani waa aniga kaliya.
Do nothing about it.	Waxba ha ka qaban isaga.
Very good.	Aad u fiican.
He decided he had enough.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu haysto wax ku filan.
This is exactly that.	Tani waa dhab ahaan taas.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
This was for everyone.	Tani waxay ahayd qof kasta.
I think he was right.	Waxaan filayaa inuu sax ahaa.
Let me know once.	I soo sheeg hal mar.
I was a little surprised.	Waan yara yaabay.
If so, there are a lot of us.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, waxaa jira wax badan oo naga mid ah.
He should not have come back here.	Ma ahayn inuu halkan ku soo noqdo.
I think it was right.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ahayd mid sax ah.
He was talking to me.	Wuu ila hadli jiray.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Very smart, really.	Aad u caqli badan, runtii.
I wanted to know.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado.
Another came in.	Mid kale ayuu soo galay.
It needs a little more consistency.	Waxay u baahan tahay wax yar oo joogto ah.
But he said nothing.	Laakiin waxba kama odhan jirin.
It was a problem.	Dhib bay ahayd.
It will always come true.	Had iyo jeer run bay ku soo noqon doontaa.
I did it most of the time.	Inta badan waan sameeyay.
I can't find it	Ma heli karo
She told him a little.	Wax yar bay u sheegtay.
That was really beautiful.	Taasi runtii waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
Everyone was ready again.	Qof walba mar kale ayuu diyaar ahaa.
It will not happen well.	Si fiican uma dhici doonto.
He would be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
And you don't have to do it.	Oo uma baahnid inaad samayso.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
What did she do.	Maxay samaysay .
Just lucky.	Kaliya nasiib badan.
It can happen anywhere.	Waxay ka dhici kartaa meel kasta.
And a good time was spent together.	Oo wakhti fiican ayaa la wada qaatay.
Before he could see it he wondered.	Inta aanu arki karin ayuu is waydiiyay.
I thought for sure this was it.	Waxaan u maleeyay hubaal inay tani tahay.
But he was not like anyone.	Laakiin ma ahayn sida qof.
A friend said.	Saaxiib ayaa yidhi.
I just had a better idea.	Kaliya waxaan lahaa fikrad ka fiican.
I guess? 	Waxaan filayaa?
I felt strange.	Waxaan dareemay wax yaab leh.
They are fine now.	Hadda way wanaagsan yihiin.
A man came home.	Nin guriga u yimid.
And there is nothing you can do.	Oo ma jiraan wax aad samayn kartaa.
If so, that's a good idea.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, waa fikrad wanaagsan.
We would not go anywhere else.	Meel kale ma aadi lahayn.
I didn't think so.	Uma malaynayn.
It needs everyone.	Waxay u baahan tahay qof walba.
I was not	Maan ahayn
He asked them not to tell anyone.	Waxa uu ka codsaday in aanay cidna u sheegin.
Just always.	Kaliya had iyo jeer.
I'm really sorry about that.	Runtii taas aad baan ugu xumahay.
Over time this may be done.	Waqti ka dib waxaa laga yaabaa in tan la sameeyo.
I need more than they need me.	Waxaan u baahanahay in ka badan inta ay ii baahan yihiin.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
He is one of them.	Isaga ayaa ka mid ah.
I will definitely stay there again.	Dhab ahaantii waan sii joogi doonaa halkaas mar kale.
I just can't help myself.	Kaliya ma is caawin karo.
But give us time.	Laakiin waqti na sii.
He needs something else.	Wax kale ayuu u baahan yahay.
Today I will talk about who made it and why.	Maanta waxaan ka hadli doonaa cidda samaysay iyo sababta.
He could not believe it.	Wuu rumaysan waayay.
I will not return.	Soo noqon maayo.
Someone like me.	Qof aniga oo kale ah.
I didn't want to be part of it.	Ma aanan rabin inaan dadka ka mid noqdo.
It is not beautiful now.	Hadda ma qurux badna.
He could not stop again.	Mar dambe wuu joojin waayay.
This is a lot of work.	Tani waa shaqo aad u badan.
Smart and smart.	Caqli iyo caqli badan.
He is a bad man.	Waa nin xun.
I would get it	waan heli lahaa
That's right, that's right.	Taasi waa wax, waa sax.
That didn’t do him well.	Taas si fiican uma samayn isaga.
After a long time.	Muddo dheer ka dib.
I am with him.	waan la joogaa.
Mostly it is true.	Inta badan waa run.
He would talk, talk, talk.	Wuu ka hadli lahaa, ka hadli lahaa, ka hadli lahaa.
But they are.	Laakiin waxay yihiin.
Do not do it until you are ready.	Ha samayn ilaa aad diyaar u tahay.
She had many friends.	Waxay lahayd saaxiibo badan.
I hope that is correct.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi sax tahay.
It would probably be better.	Waxay u badan tahay inay fiicnaan lahayd.
I want more than anything.	Waxaan rabaa in ka badan wax kasta.
Everything is bad, bad, bad.	Wax walba waa xun, xun, xun.
I think it should be more.	Waxaan qabaa inay tahay in ka badan.
I need another one	Waxaan u baahanahay mid kale
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
That is not true.	Taasi run ma aha.
I really, really, love you.	Run ahaantii, runtii, waan ku jeclahay.
It can take a long time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer.
It’s what we do during.	Waa waxa aan samayno inta lagu jiro.
But nothing, no one.	Laakiin waxba ma jiraan, qofna.
He knows it well.	Si fiican ayuu u yaqaan.
And who knows what else.	Oo yaa yaqaan waxa kale.
I get nothing.	waxba ma helo.
This is not going to be pretty.	Tani ma noqon doonto mid qurux badan.
I hope we will be friends.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan noqon doono saaxiibo.
It is the most common reason.	Waa sababta ugu badan.
But this is new.	Laakiin tani waa mid cusub.
I had you.	waan ku lahaa.
A little too.	Wax yar sidoo kale.
She is like you.	Waxay kula mid tahay adiga.
It is very beautiful too.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay sidoo kale.
And very good.	Iyo mid aad u fiican.
It does not say everything.	Wax walba uma sheegto.
It was taken.	Waa la qaatay.
I really did.	Runtii waan galay.
You may not understand.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan fahmin.
He can stay here.	Wuu joogi karaa halkan.
That’s why we do this, right ?.	Taasi waa sababta aan tan u samayno, sax?.
Not more than one year.	Ma aha in ka badan hal sano.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
He was not a bad man.	Ma ahayn nin xun.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Which, of course, she had.	Taas oo, si, ay lahayd.
This will take time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
It is difficult to strike him.	Way adag tahay in shaqo joojin lagu sameeyo isaga.
It was still too early for anyone to be there.	Weli waxay ahayd goor hore oo qofna inuu halkaas joogo.
But so far it has not.	Laakiin ilaa hadda maaha.
I did not go back.	Dib uma noqon.
There is a long time today.	Waqti dheer ayaa maanta jira.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Maybe someone knows.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu qof yaqaan.
I can talk to him.	Waan kala hadli karaa isaga.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda way fiican tahay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
A lot is for sure.	Wax badan ayaa hubaal ah.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
It has been made real.	Waxaa laga dhigay dhab.
And this too.	Iyo tan sidoo kale.
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
It has been a long time for that.	Waxay ahayd muddo dheer taas.
We would still be there if it weren't for that.	Weli waan joogi lahayn halkaas haddii aysan taasi ahayn.
I think that is old.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay mid hore.
I was at work.	Waxaan ku jiray shaqada.
It is all true.	Dhammaan waa dhab.
I have a lot.	Wax badan ayaan hayaa.
I will, I must.	Waan yeeli doonaa, waa inaan.
That was good but very bad.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid fiican laakiin aad u xun.
But so we are.	Laakiin si aan u nahay.
Just good to know.	Kaliya fiican in la ogaado.
It looks like a lot of work.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo aad u badan.
It can't be.	Ma noqon karto.
I think it is a very exciting time.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay wakhti aad u xiiso badan.
But that is enough.	Laakiin taasi waa ku filan tahay.
It's all a lie.	Dhammaan waa been.
He did not come to tell them he loved them.	Uma uu iman inuu u sheego inuu jecel yahay.
It’s not really fun.	Ma aha mid xiiso leh runtii.
This was a great place.	Tani waxay ahayd meel fiican.
Something she knew she needed to do.	Wax ay ogaatay inay u baahan tahay inay samayso.
I really don't know.	Run ahaantii ma garanayo.
So, it's very difficult.	Marka taasi, waa mid aad u adag.
It looks like they are.	Waxay u egtahay inay yihiin.
You will.	Waad sameyn doontaa.
That was exactly what happened.	Taasi waxay ahayd si sax ah waxa dhacay.
A lot has been here a while ago.	Wax badan ayaa halkan joogay in yar ka hor.
I just think it's weird.	Kaliya waxaan u maleynayaa inay la yaab leh tahay.
Not that it will always help.	Ma aha in ay had iyo jeer caawin doonto.
We will catch up soon	Dhawaan ayaan soo qaban doonaa
That may not be a bad thing at all.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay taasi ahayn wax xun.
This is what happened here.	Tani waa waxa halkan ka dhacay.
It will be.	Waxay noqon doontaa.
He certainly knew that.	Hubaal wuu ogaa taas.
He saw it again.	Mar kale ayuu arkay.
That can take a long time.	Taasi waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer.
I told him he could only get it.	Waxaan u sheegay inuu kaliya heli karo.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
She had to talk to him about that.	Waxay ahayd inuu taas kala hadlo isaga.
He did not want to leave.	Ma rabin in uu baxo.
Stop working on anything else.	Jooji shaqada wax kasta oo kale.
Very good money.	Lacag aad u wanaagsan.
This is great.	Tani waa mid weyn.
We will see what we will see.	Waan arki doonaa waxaan arki doono.
He has to be here.	Waa inuu halkaan joogo.
But this was not a job	Laakiin tani ma ahayn shaqo
Not the worst, not the best.	Ma aha kan ugu xun, ma aha kan ugu fiican.
We are so excited to be able to do this for you !.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan tan kuu sameyn karno!.
Can you keep him.	Ma aad u haysan kartaa isaga.
If you have money, it's great.	Haddii aad lacag leedahay, aad bay u fiican tahay.
But he is still there.	Laakiin weli wuu joogaa.
I hope it is good for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay kuu fiican tahay.
Not that anyone would see it.	Ma aha in qofna uu arki lahaa.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
I knew it all.	Waan ogaa taas oo dhan.
They will stay here	Way joogi doonaan halkan
We need something better than that.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax taas ka fiican.
I want more.	Wax badan ayaan rabaa.
She didn't want to, at first.	Ma ay rabin, marka hore.
I need this for work.	Waxaan tan ugu baahanahay shaqada.
I saw how it could be.	Waxaan arkay sida ay noqon karto.
It's just fine.	Kaliya wuu fiican yahay.
To see if they need something.	Si loo arko inay wax u baahan yihiin iyo in kale.
But let me tell you why.	Laakiin aan kuu sheego sababta.
They are still alive.	Wali waa nool yihiin.
She was busy.	Waxay ahayd qof mashquul ah.
They are clear on this.	Way ku cad yihiin arrintan.
Ayuu yiri.	Ayuu yiri.
He was there regularly.	Si joogto ah ayuu halkaas u joogay.
It's a lot.	Waa wax badan.
I will give it.	waan siin doonaa.
It is often very bad.	Inta badan waa mid aad u xun.
He really enjoyed that.	Aad ayuu uga helay taas.
He may still be in prison.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli xabsiga ku jiro.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
We can't do this.	Ma samayn karno tan.
Now everything is fine.	Hadda wax walba waa wanaagsan yihiin.
It was really awful.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
For a long time, really.	Waqti dheer, dhab ahaantii.
More to come	Wax badan oo soo socda
Maybe I did well in the same thing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan si fiican u sameeyay isla wax la mid ah.
It is more than that.	Way ka badan tahay taas.
And this is something everyone loves.	Oo tani qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay.
Really not sure.	Runtii ma hubo.
Don't go back there.	Halkaas ha ku noqon.
Every job is hard.	Shaqo kasta waa adag tahay.
I don't see it, but it's fine.	Ma arko, laakiin waa fiican tahay.
Everything really is.	Wax kasta oo run ahaantii waa.
He wanted everything.	Wax walba wuu rabay.
So far it has been all work.	Ilaa hadda waxay ahayd shaqo oo dhan.
New to the job.	Ku cusub shaqada.
Not everyone is like you.	Qof walba adiga oo kale maaha.
I thought maybe we could go by car.	Waxaan u maleynayay in laga yaabo inaan aadi karno baabuur.
She really did, another day here.	Runtii way samaysay, maalin kale halkan.
They may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan haysan.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
They may not have time to do that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan waqti u helin inay taas sameeyaan.
It would probably be better to eat.	Waxay u badan tahay inay u fiicnaan lahayd inay cunto.
I think now, few of us do.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in hadda, in yar oo naga mid ah ay sameeyaan.
But here it is beautiful, too.	Laakiin halkan waa qurux, sidoo kale.
And that he does not want.	Iyo in uusan rabin.
I don't know how to do this.	Ma garanayo sida tan loo sameeyo.
Here and now.	Halkan iyo hadda.
There is nothing like prison.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah xabsiga.
But she did.	Laakiin taasi way samaysay.
When it's good, it's really good.	Marka ay wanaagsan tahay, runtii way fiican tahay.
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
I had to say something.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax sheego.
Just everyone.	Kaliya dadka oo dhan.
I put an idea there.	fikrad ayaan halkaas dhigay.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii waan ka helay.
But something really needs to be said about this.	Laakiin run ahaantii wax baa u baahan in arrintan laga sheego.
This is what they do.	Tani waa waxa ay u sameeyaan.
You do not need an appointment.	Uma baahnid ballan.
That is not my job.	Taasi shaqo igama aha.
You will see how it will be.	Waxaad arki doontaa sida ay noqon doonto.
But really, very good.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, aad u fiican.
He needs to leave.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu ka tago.
I get nothing from him.	Waxba ma helo isaga.
I am very happy so far.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay ilaa hadda.
Everything is small.	Wax walba waa yar yihiin.
After all, maybe enough.	Ka dib oo dhan, waxaa laga yaabaa in ku filan.
And he liked what he saw.	Oo uu ka helay waxa uu arkay.
But now there is no idea.	Laakiin hadda wax fikrad ah ma jiraan.
I don't know where.	Ma garanayo meel.
I think you really like me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad runtii i jeceshahay.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I don't want to.	Lama rabo.
Just hard.	Kaliya mid adag.
You can't do it right.	Si sax ah uma samayn kartid.
I know what is true.	Waan ogahay waxa run ah.
He may not know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ogeyn.
There was no one else.	Qof kale ma jirin.
That is how it always is.	Taasi waa sida ay had iyo jeer tahay.
He wants to be with you.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu kula joogo.
This is more difficult.	Tani way ka adag tahay.
Maybe help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in la caawiyo.
But that was not a big deal.	Laakiin taasi wax weyn ma ahayn.
Ah, he said, he got it.	Ah, wuxuu yidhi, wuu helay.
I will tell you something you do not know.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa wax aadan ogeyn.
He didn't have to work tomorrow.	Ma ahayn inuu berri shaqeeyo.
He was always surprised.	Mar kasta ayuu la yaabay.
I never told anyone.	Weligay cidna uma sheegin.
But it is old.	Laakiin waa hore.
We are ready, for sure.	Waxaan diyaar u nahay, hubaal.
What, he did not know.	Waxa, ma uu ogayn.
I will only give him to work with me.	Waxaan siin doonaa isaga inuu ila shaqeeyo oo kaliya.
Not once.	Hal mar maaha.
Tell us nothing.	Waxba noo sheeg.
It is good for you.	Adiga ayaa kuu fiican.
Probably the closest.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay meesha ugu dhow.
Too bad, really.	Aad u xun, dhab ahaantii.
I didn't think it would happen.	Uma malaynayn inay dhici doonto.
The most obvious.	Tan ugu cad.
You will be fine.	Waad ku fiicnaan doontaa.
I just don’t buy it.	Kaliya ma iibsado.
He was also a great friend.	Waxa kale oo uu ahaa saaxiib weyn.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
Please stop.	Fadlan jooji.
No one could see it.	Qofna ma arki karin.
I will get it back	dib ayaan u heli doonaa
I hope you will help !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ku caawin doonto!.
He is obviously the same person.	Sida cad waa isku qof.
Back house, if all.	Guriga dambe, haddii ay dhan tahay.
Stop me immediately	degdeg ii jooji
No one else knows.	Ma jiro qof kale inuu ogaado.
He is with someone else.	Qof kale ayuu la joogaa.
I was really surprised.	Runtii waan la yaabay.
I am so happy to see you again.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko.
I need more	wax badan ayaan u baahanahay
But it was fun.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
You can still come back	Wali waad soo noqon kartaa
What did you say.	Maxaad ku tidhi.
But that is not what he wants.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa uu doonayo.
But this is a problem.	Laakiin tani waa dhibaato.
Can you believe they are not coming back with you.	Ma rumaysan kartaa in aanay kula soo noqon.
Like yesterday.	Sida shalay.
Great and clear.	Si weyn oo cad.
I don't know what you can say.	Ma garanayo inaad sheegi karto.
I really looked good.	Runtii waxaan u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
I have been doing this for a while.	In muddo ah ayaan taas sameeyay.
No idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma jiraan.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
Maybe just.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in kaliya.
But he stayed.	Laakiin wuu iska joogay.
Whether you know it or not, that doesn't matter.	Haddii aad ogtahay iyo haddii kale, taasi dhib ma leh.
A lot of bad things will happen.	Waxyaabo badan oo xun ayaa dhici doona.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
They probably won't see it again.	Waxay u badan tahay in aanay dib u arki doonin.
He bought it.	Wuu iibsaday.
It's a real surprise.	Waa yaab dhab ah.
It can even help.	Xitaa way ku caawin kartaa.
Both are very complex.	Labaduba aad bay u adag yihiin.
Done again.	Mar kale sameeyay.
I need to go out a lot	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax badan baxo
That's how she knows.	Taasi waa sida ay ogtahay.
We loved the place.	Meesha waanu jeclayn.
I was left behind.	Waa la iga tagay.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
You can make some money.	Waxaad samayn kartaa xoogaa lacag ah.
Can anyone help me know what is going on.	Qof ma iga caawin karaa in aan ogaado waxa socda.
He fell again.	Mar kale ayuu soo dhacay.
Better than others.	Ka wanaagsan dadka kale.
It will be him.	Waxay noqon doontaa isaga.
The front door.	Albaabka hore.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
Nothing, nothing.	Waxba, waxba .
Otherwise it will not happen.	Haddii kale ma dhici doonto.
I hope you will agree.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ogolaan doonto.
We can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban karno.
In fact, she says.	Runtii, way leedahay.
And I always want more.	Oo aan had iyo jeer doonayo wax badan.
Everyone had a place, and it was made for them.	Qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa meel, oo loo sameeyay.
So he came out.	Sidaas ayuu u soo baxay.
But it is still good.	Laakiin weli way fiican tahay.
Let him have it.	Ha haysto.
It looks beautiful.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid qurux badan.
You can now go home	Hadda waad aadi kartaa guriga
Too lucky and unfortunate.	Si aad u nasiib badan oo aan nasiib lahayn.
It really was something.	Runtii wax bay ahayd.
Same everywhere.	La mid ah meel kasta oo kale.
It's like now.	Waa sida hadda oo kale.
It’s hard, it really is.	Way adag tahay, runtii waa.
we will see.	waan arki doonaa.
Now I can't say anything.	Hadda waxba ma odhan karo.
That could not be better.	Sidaas uma fiicnaan karto.
Not anymore.	Mar dambe maaha.
Everyone would help.	Qof walba wuu caawin lahaa .
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
That was a good job.	Taasi waxay ahayd shaqo fiican.
No one knew anything.	Qofna waxba ma ogayn.
Maybe more than me.	Malaha aniga ayaa iga badan.
No, we have to do it, but we will do it.	Ma aha, waa inaan samayno, laakiin waan yeeli doonaa.
I could not have imagined that.	Maan u malayn karin sidaas.
I couldn't do it, I couldn't.	Ma aanan sameyn karin, ma awoodin.
I can always see people.	Mar walba dadka waan arki karaa.
That is great.	Taasi waa mid aad u weyn.
This may help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay taasi kaa caawiso.
I don't see how she can do that.	Ma arko sida ay sidaas u samayn karto.
That is certainly true.	Taasi waa run dhab ahaan.
He loves you so much.	Aad buu kuu jecel yahay.
He would say.	Waxa uu odhan lahaa.
But what you say is true.	Laakiin waxa aad leedahay waa run.
It's like you're not here.	Waxay la mid tahay inaadan halkan joogin.
I have no job.	Shaqo ma hayo.
Now it would be a good time to have it.	Hadda waxay ahaan lahayd wakhti fiican oo la helo.
You are a person.	Waxaad tahay qof.
You can do it first.	Waxaad samayn kartaa marka hore.
I don't like to be seen.	Ma jecla in la arko.
For me, a lot of work.	Aniga ahaan, shaqo aad u badan.
Whatever you like.	Wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
I think it is beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan tahay.
Like you are always busy.	Jeceshahay inaad mashquul tahay mar walba.
In fact, much remains to be done.	Dhab ahaantii, wax badan ayaa weli ahaa.
As much as they need me.	Inta ay ii baahan yihiin.
Maybe we are still.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan weli nahay.
I was very impressed with him.	Aad iyo aad ayaan isaga la dhacay.
Maybe they still do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli sameeyaan.
Maybe it was true there was nothing to do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay run ahayd ma jirin wax la sameeyo.
I couldn’t tell him anymore.	Mar dambe ma u sheegi karin.
It can happen to him greatly.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa isaga si weyn.
I really wasn't.	Runtii ma aanan ahayn.
I can cook	Waan karin karaa
Whatever happened to you there, you can tell me.	Wax kasta oo halkaas kugu dhacay, waad ii sheegi kartaa.
You can take what you can get.	Waxaad qaadan kartaa waxaad heli karto.
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
If someone doesn't like me, fine.	Haddii qof uusan i jeclayn, fiican.
Maybe I don't think so.	Malaha sidaas uma malaynayo.
They are very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan yihiin.
I just didn’t do anything.	Kaliya waxba ma samayn.
But just to be seen.	Laakiin kaliya in la arko.
There is still a lot of great work to be done.	Weli waxaa jira shaqo badan oo weyn.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale arko.
I also wonder how it will be.	Waxa kale oo aan la yaabanahay sida ay noqon doonto.
I would really like to see it	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko
We cannot be everything to everyone.	Ma noqon karno wax walba dadka oo dhan.
But, it was nothing.	Laakiin, waxba ma ahayn.
It was alive.	Wax nool bay ahayd.
But that was not what it was.	Laakiin taasi ma ahayn waxa ay ahayd.
No one does that.	Qofna sidaas oo kale uma sameeyo.
I tried and tried	waan isku dayay oo isku dayay
Maybe you are lucky.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tahay mid nasiib badan.
I started small	Wax yar ayaan bilaabay
I want you to be with me tonight.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ila joogto caawa.
You can't do everything but you can do something.	Wax walba ma samayn kartid laakiin wax baad samayn kartaa.
I want to see you soon.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko si degdeg ah.
She would do something about it.	Wax bay ka qaban lahayd.
I wanted to.	Aniga waan rabay.
No one else does.	Qof kale ma sameeyo.
He wants to know what you did.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ogaado waxaad samaysay.
Something strange happened to me.	Wax yaab leh ayaa igu dhacay.
That is all you need to know now.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay inaad hadda ogaato.
You said you still love me.	Waxaad tidhi weli waad i jeceshahay.
He said he was busy.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu mashquul yahay.
What happened.	Maxaa ku dhacay.
But it was not to be done.	Laakiin ma ahayn in la sameeyo.
He is good at what he does.	Wuu ku fiican yahay waxa uu sameeyo.
I can't afford one now.	Ma awoodin in aan iibsado mid hadda.
But there has always been a lot for me.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waxaa jiray wax badan oo aniga ah.
But they are still difficult.	Laakiin weli way adag yihiin.
But he also knew she needed this.	Laakiin sidoo kale wuu ogaa inay u baahan tahay tan.
I just know it is.	Kaliya waan ogahay inay tahay.
They need to be close to people.	Waxay u baahan yihiin inay dadka u dhow yihiin.
And maybe he had.	Oo malaha wuu lahaa.
In fact, it can take time.	Run ahaantii, waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
Tell me what you like and don't like.	Ii sheeg waxaad jeceshahay oo aadan ka helin.
You must be able to do whatever you want.	Waa in aad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
And what bad food! 	Oo maxaa cunto xun!
But he could not stop.	Laakiin wuu joojin waayay.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
Lots of surprises.	Waxyaabo badan oo yaab leh.
Luckily for that.	Nasiib badan taas.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
If it were, everyone would do it.	Haddii ay ahaan lahayd, qof kastaa wuu samayn lahaa.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
He just had good things to say.	Waxa kaliya oo uu lahaa waxyaabo wanaagsan oo uu ku hadlo.
A well-loved man.	Nin si fiican loo jecel yahay.
The best place to do so was at home.	Meesha ugu fiican ee sidaas lagu sameeyo waxay ahayd guriga.
If he does this once, he can do it again.	Haddii uu tan hal mar sameeyo, mar kale wuu samayn karaa.
Anything you are happy to tell me.	Wax kasta oo aad ku faraxsan tahay inaad ii sheegto.
Everyone is excited to see it.	Qof kastaa wuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu arko.
But it is likely that he would get it all.	Laakiin waxa ay u badan tahay in uu heli lahaa oo dhan.
And here's another one.	Oo waa kan mid kale.
This is a very, very big problem.	Tani waa dhibaato aad iyo aad u weyn.
I just don't see how.	Kaliya ma arko sida.
Many of us could not do that.	In badan oo naga mid ah ma samayn karin taas.
I want you to do this.	Waxaan rabaa inaad tan sameyso.
You are beautiful.	Qurux baad tahay.
A little bit of this, a little bit of it.	In yar oo tan ah, in yar oo ka mid ah.
More to learn !.	Wax badan in la barto!.
It may be available at any time.	Waxa laga yaabaa in la helo wakhti kasta.
Can you believe it?	Ma rumaysan kartaa.
You can always do something new.	Mar walba waxaad samayn kartaa wax cusub.
That is too early.	Taasi waa wakhti hore.
He could not stretch.	Waa uu kala bixi waayay.
Nothing is clear.	Ma jiro wax si cad.
If you want someone else, let us know.	Haddii aad rabto qof kale, noo soo sheeg.
It didn't matter what happened before.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn wixii hore u dhacay.
To do this again.	Si aad taas mar kale u sameyso.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
He did not pay.	Ma uu la bixin.
It was very clear and unspoken.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u cad oo aan laga hadlin.
He always told me everything.	Mar walba wax walba wuu ii sheegi jiray.
I love everything	Wax walba waan jeclahay
It can be a good friend, if you let it.	Waxay noqon kartaa saaxiib wanaagsan, haddii aad u ogolaan lahayd.
Maybe it's true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay run tahay .
It is not a prison.	Ma aha xabsiga.
It will not hurt.	Wax dhib ah ma yeeli doono.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
But he knew, he knew.	Laakiin wuu ogaa, wuu ogaa.
I don't get it	ma helo
I will definitely stay there again.	Waa hubaal inaan halkaas sii joogi doono mar kale.
That is obvious.	Taasi waa wax iska cad.
He had to keep it somewhere else.	Waxa uu ahaa in uu meel kale ku hayo.
I think this is a good idea.	Waxaan qabaa in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
There must be time.	Waa inuu jiro waqti.
No one is close.	Ma jiro qof u dhow.
No one, no one.	Qofna kuma jiro, qofna ma jiro.
That may be correct.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa si sax ah.
It was a small job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo yar.
It didn't take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan.
I'm in trouble.	dhib baan ku jiraa.
It is another thing you need to know.	Waa wax kale oo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
Certainly not, but it is also possible.	Run ahaantii maaha, laakiin sidoo kale waa laga yaabaa.
They should have done so.	Waxay ahayd inay sidaas sameeyaan.
It was a much better idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad aad uga wanaagsan.
I will say more about this a bit.	Wax badan ayaan arrintan ka odhan doonaa xoogaa.
I am very, very happy with that.	Aad iyo aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
But it is also not a good idea.	Laakiin sidoo kale fikrad fiican maaha.
I will be back soon.	mar dhow waan soo noqon doonaa.
I want to see them all	Waxaan rabaa inaan wada arko
He wanted it again.	Mar kale ayuu rabay.
I just didn’t know him.	Kaliya maan ogeyn isaga.
I knew that would do more for him.	Waan ogaa in taasi isaga wax ka badan u yeeli doonto.
If he can do that, he can do anything.	Haddii uu taas samayn karo, wax kasta wuu samayn karaa.
There is not enough food.	Ma jiro cunto ku filan.
It is the best reason.	Waa sababta ugu fiican.
I will not come back again.	Soo noqon maayo mar dambe .
He has come well so far, he said.	Si fiican ayuu u yimid ilaa hadda, ayuu is yidhi.
I really wondered how.	Runtii waan la yaabay sida.
You should have done so.	Waxay ahayd inaad sidaas u sameyso.
He was overjoyed.	Isaga oo faraxsan ayuu la dhacay.
I came out	waan ka soo baxay
For a while he did not get one.	In muddo ah ma uu helin mid.
Surprisingly, that's right.	Yaab, waa sax.
It can take a very long time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti aad u dheer.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
That was for him.	Taasi waxay u ahayd isaga.
You can see it here	Waxaad ka arki kartaa halkan
I do not want to talk to you.	Ma rabo inaan kula hadlo.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii badan.
Everyone is being held.	Qof walba waa la hayaa.
Still, a lot of the same.	Weli, wax badan oo isku mid ah.
It is difficult to keep this for a long time.	Way adag tahay in taas lagu sii hayo muddo dheer.
They are real friends, really.	Waa saaxiibo dhab ah, runtii.
I have one for you.	Mid baan ku leeyahay.
But you don't need any problems.	Laakiin uma baahnid wax dhib ah.
This should be done in one place.	Tani waa in lagu sameeyaa hal meel mar.
he could not stop.	wuu joojin waayay.
I got here very lucky.	Waxaan halkan ku helay nasiib aad u wanaagsan.
In fact, he thought he had.	Runtii, wuxuu mooday inuu haysto.
Here and now.	Halkan iyo hadda.
Me too.	Aniga sidoo kale.
It’s right here in everything we do every day.	Waa sax halkan wax kasta oo aan samayno maalin kasta.
He would not have stayed here long enough.	Ma uu joogi lahaa halkan waqti ku filan.
Not once.	Hal mar oo kale maaha.
He may have been in prison.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xabsiga ku jiray.
I just didn’t think it would be inclusive.	Kaliya uma malaynayn inay noqon doonto mid loo dhan yahay.
It really is.	Waa si dhab ah.
A man like him was never ready.	Nin isaga oo kale ah waligiis diyaar uma ahayn.
Do this first.	Marka hore tan u qabo.
Where you are is not a problem.	Meesha aad joogto dhib maaha.
I was always surprised by this.	Mar walba tan ayaan la yaabay.
This is my favorite.	Waa kan aan jeclahay.
It really wasn't.	Runtii ma ahayn.
A lot of the same might be.	Wax badan oo la mid ah ayaa laga yaabaa.
I really wanted to.	Aad ayaan u rabay.
He is new here	Wuu ku cusub yahay halkan
Maybe that's enough.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ku filan tahay.
It needs a common place.	Waxay u baahan tahay meel la wada leeyahay.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
I seem to have found nothing.	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaanan waxba helin.
It is still the same.	Weli waa sidii hore.
I have to leave	Waa inaan baxo
She said a lot.	Wax badan bay tidhi.
I felt a little better today.	Waxaan dareemay xoogaa fiicnaan maanta.
I will do it for you.	Adiga ayaan kaa yeeli doonaa .
Really great.	Runtii aad u weyn.
He did not say.	Ma uusan odhan.
It was also quick and fun.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd mid degdeg ah oo xiiso leh.
Nothing came of it.	Waxba uma iman.
He took no money.	Wax lacag ah ma uu qaadan.
Maybe you do too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale sameyso.
I have.	waan hayaa.
That’s why they don’t have money, either.	Taasi waa sababta aysan lacag u haysan, sidoo kale.
But really, that is not true.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, taasi sax maaha.
We will go wherever you want.	Waxaan tagi doonaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
I came back to help.	Dib baan u soo noqday si aan u caawiyo.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
I have no problem with anyone.	Qofna wax dhib ah kama hayo.
Probably very good.	Malaha wax aad u fiican.
There was still something.	Weli wax baa jiray.
They do, really.	Waxay sameeyaan, runtii.
It's time	Waa wakhti
There is no such thing anymore.	Ma jiraan wax la mid ah mar dambe.
I do not speak.	Kama hadlo.
In fact, it has a lot.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay leedahay wax badan.
not ready.	diyaar uma aha.
That’s all, really.	Taasi waa dhan, runtii.
But very difficult.	Laakiin aad ugu adag.
I don't seem to do that.	Uma eka in aan sidaas sameeyo.
He is not ready yet	Wali diyaar uma aha
I hope he stays in a better place than this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu joogo meel ka wanaagsan tan.
I am a busy man.	Waxaan ahay nin mashquul ah.
we will see him.	waan arki doonaa isaga.
Really, well done.	Runtii, si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I didn't know that.	Taas maan ogeyn.
But not sure how to do it.	Laakiin ma hubo sida loo sameeyo.
I hope everything is fine for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in wax walba ay kugu fiican yihiin.
Long and beautiful friend.	Saaxiib dheer oo qurux badan.
In fact, it probably was.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd.
I'm sorry I didn't want to.	Waan ka xumahay inaanan rabin.
In fact, they are almost too cute to eat.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ku dhow yihiin inay aad u qurux badan yihiin in la cuno.
Just one day.	Kaliya hal maalin.
I don't want to say too much.	Ma rabo inaan wax badan sheego.
I love that	waan jeclahay taas
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
That is what it is.	Taasi waa waxa ay u tahay.
That is why all this is great.	Taasi waa sababta tan oo dhan u weyn tahay.
This was quick.	Tani waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
It can be anything.	Wuxuu noqon karaa wax kasta.
Something he felt he should have told.	Wax uu dareemay in ay tahay in uu u sheego.
Real work.	Shaqo dhab ah.
It was definitely awful.	Waa hubaal in ay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Now given that could be again.	Hadda la siiyay taasi waxay noqon kartaa mar kale.
Everyone is very visible.	Qof walba aad buu u muuqdaa.
Now he was mostly just great.	Hadda wuxuu ahaa inta badan kaliya weyn.
Tonight he knew.	Caawa wuu ogaa.
Little is still small.	Yar weli waa yar yahay.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
But if he wants to, that's fine.	Laakiin haddii uu rabo, taasi waa fiican tahay.
One day, but not now.	Maalin, laakiin hadda maaha.
Door to door.	Albaabka albaabka.
There was little.	Wax yar baa la lahaa.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
You will find a better place.	Waxaad heli doontaa meel ka fiican.
I want to talk to him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo.
It will be a little bad surprise.	Waxay noqon doontaa yaab yar oo xun.
Ah, here it is.	Ah, waa kan.
What to do! 	Maxaa la sameeyaa!
Tomorrow is another day.	Berrito waa maalin kale.
That is me again.	Taasi waa aniga mar kale.
It's very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
There is.	Waxaa jira .
I did not believe him.	Ma rumaysan isaga.
She is like me.	Waxay ila mid tahay.
I am afraid of everything.	Wax walba waan ka baqayaa.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
It will do.	Way yeeli doontaa.
Mostly it is true.	Inta badan waa run.
Always, everything.	Had iyo jeer, wax walba.
Still not sure if he is OK.	Wali ma hubo inuu fiican yahay.
That is what you will get.	Taasi waa waxa aad heli doonto.
I was not present	Maan joogin
We need a new idea.	Waxaan u baahanahay fikrad cusub.
You, everyone.	Adiga, qof walba.
Everyone will be very excited.	Qof kastaa wuxuu noqon doonaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
But you would not see anything.	Laakiin waxba ma aad arki lahayd.
you did not come.	ma aadan iman.
But it was like nothing.	Laakiin waxay ahayd sida waxba.
I can't keep it.	Kuma haysan karo.
I tried to speak.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan hadlo.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
was not correct.	sax ma ahayn .
Who does not have time.	Yaa aan wakhti haysan.
They did not succeed.	Ma ay guulaysan.
But not before.	Laakiin ka hor maaha.
He didn't want anything.	Waxba ma uu rabin.
It was very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
He said I want to talk to him.	Wuxuu yidhi waxaan rabaa inuu ila hadlo.
It was tomorrow.	Berri bay ahayd.
What do you think.	Maxay kula tahay.
Maybe it's the same now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hadda la mid tahay.
He tried food.	Cunto ayuu isku dayay.
He knows the place well.	Meesha si fiican ayuu u yaqaan.
People love it.	Dadka jecel.
I say the same.	Waxaan leeyahay sidaas oo kale.
But it certainly is.	Laakiin hubaal wuu yahay.
I am really happy.	Runtii aad baan u faraxsanahay.
We are wanted.	Waa nala rabaa.
He says that.	Taas ayuu ku leeyahay.
But it really doesn't matter.	Laakiin runtii dhib ma leh.
It's gone, you know.	Waa la waayay, waad ogtahay.
I'm back.	Waan ku soo noqday.
She was not busy.	Waxay ahayd mid aan mashquul ahayn.
I want more	Wax badan ayaan rabaa
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
There is something in it.	Wax baa ku jira.
But they will.	Laakiin way samayn doonaan.
Maybe a little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in yar.
Not someone else.	Ma aha qof kale.
I want to stay	Waxaan rabaa inaan sii joogo
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
I like	waan jeclahay
This is very difficult here.	Tani waa wax aad u adag halkan.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad u qurux badan tahay.
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
That is the only thing that belongs to me.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aniga leh.
This is where it will be.	Tani waa halka ay noqon doonto.
I couldn't believe it.	Waan rumaysan waayay.
You need a little and not a lot.	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax yar oo aan wax badan ahayn.
It was not a big deal.	Wax weyn ma ahayn.
Don't go back.	Dib ha u noqon.
And it's not just an opportunity.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya fursad.
Also.	Sidoo kale .
Very happy, really.	Aad u faraxsan, runtii.
Now I will leave here.	Hadda waan ka bixi doonaa halkan.
La la la.	La la la.
That cannot happen.	Taasi ma dhici karto.
One big, one small.	Mid weyn, mid yar.
That's how he wanted it.	Waa sidii uu rabay.
All you need to know.	Dhammaan waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
Still a real new idea.	Weli fikrad dhab ah oo cusub.
He has not seen it yet.	Wali ma uu arag.
Maybe she had.	Malaha waxay lahayd.
I think it's true.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay run tahay.
We'll see what she can do.	Waan arki doonaa waxa ay sameyn karto.
I thought I needed it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan u baahanahay.
Would you like to know more about us?	Ma jeceshahay inaad wax badan naga ogaato?.
I think I will go home now.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan guriga aadi doono hadda.
I want to help.	Waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo.
Now, nothing works.	Hadda, waxba ma shaqeeyo.
Everyone fell.	Dadka oo dhan wuu dhacay.
Now I am ready for work.	Hadda waxaan diyaar u ahay shaqada.
After all, that’s why it happened so far.	Ka dib, waa sababta uu u dhacay ilaa hadda.
Still not sure how.	Wali ma hubo sida.
But he would like it if he wanted to.	Laakiin wuu jeclaan lahaa haddii uu rabo.
I got one	Mid baan helay
They live everywhere.	Waxay ku nool yihiin meel kasta.
It was like every day.	Waxay ahayd sida maalin kasta.
She doesn't understand yet.	Ma ay fahmin ilaa hadda.
He stays there.	Halkaas ayuu iska joogaa.
I made him leave the house.	Waxaan ka dhigay inuu guriga ka baxo.
I love everything and everything.	Waxaan jeclahay wax kasta iyo wax kasta.
I just wanted to get there.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan halkaas ka helo.
Everything is still.	Wax walba waa weli.
There is something for everyone.	Qof walba wax baa jira.
But that is not what it says.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ay leedahay.
He felt he had that.	Wuxuu dareemay in uu taas ku leeyahay.
She said it was nothing.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay waxba ahayn.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay wax la mid ah ma arag.
They should not be there.	Ma aha in aysan halkaas joogin.
There is always something going on for me.	Mar walba wax baa ii socda.
Even people who have no friends other than me.	Xitaa dadka aan saaxiibo kale lahayn oo aan aniga ahayn.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
He was really.	Wuxuu ahaa runtii.
He never does anything.	Wax waligiis ma sameeyo.
It will be good for me.	Way ii fiicnaan doontaa aniga.
It is true now.	Waa run hadda.
It really can't happen.	Runtii ma dhici karto.
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
I don't think so.	U malayn maayo.
I often don’t.	Inta badan ma sameeyo.
Better yet, it does nothing.	Si ka sii wanaagsan, waxba ma samaynayso.
He did well.	Si fiican ayuu sameeyay.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
He may not have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan mid lahayn.
That is not for everyone.	Taasi maaha qof walba.
He would do anything for it.	Wax walba wuu u samayn lahaa.
I am not	Anigu ma ihi
He left again.	Mar kale ayuu baxay.
You are lucky.	Nasiib baad leedahay.
Over time, it will go away.	Waqti ka dib, way tagi doontaa.
I am still very sorry for that.	Weli aad ayaan uga xumahay taas.
I know that is true.	Waan ogahay in taasi run tahay.
I can do it if you don't have time.	Waan sameyn karaa haddii aadan waqti haysan.
You belong to him.	Isaga ayaad leedahay.
I am here	Waxaan ahay halkan
She is always very happy.	Had iyo jeer aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
Is it enough.	Ma ku filan tahay.
He said they did not.	Wuxuu sheegay in aysan sameyn.
This should not surprise us.	Tani waa in aan la yaab nagu noqon.
It's really fast.	Waa dhab degdeg ah.
It may be surprising.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in la yaab leh.
Everyone has it.	Qof kastaa wuu leeyahay.
Yesterday and today and tomorrow.	Shalay iyo maanta iyo berri.
Everyone wanted to do something.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo wax.
There is no way they would not tell me.	Ma jirto si aanay ii sheegi lahayn.
He really took me.	Runtii wuu i qaatay.
I looked closely.	Waxaan si dhow u eegay.
I pretended this.	Tan ayaan iska dhigay.
We cannot do this without discussion.	Ma samayn karno tan oo kale haddii aan la wada hadlin.
Nothing strange happened to us.	Ma jirin wax la yaab leh oo nagu dhacay.
He is still there.	Wali wuu joogaa.
I can't see	Ma arki karo
There was not much chance of that.	Ma jirin fursad badan oo taas ah.
It's a beautiful time.	Waa wakhti qurux badan.
The French did the same.	Faransiiska ayaa sidaas oo kale sameeyay.
That’s a lot of it.	Taasi waa wax badan oo ay tahay.
But there was some fun.	Laakiin waxaa jiray xoogaa xiiso ah.
Not too hard.	Aad uma adag.
It was found.	Waa la helay.
We need help with everything.	Waxaan u baahanahay in wax walba laga caawiyo.
Maybe it's something else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay wax kale.
Everyone wants to be with you for real.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu kula joogo dhab ahaantii.
This will not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon doonto.
There must be a place.	Waa in ay jirto meel.
He told me as soon as he was found.	Isla markii lagu helay buu ii sheegay.
No one can see '.	Qofna waxba ma arki karo'.
Not sure how.	Ma hubo sida.
It may not always be so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas oo kale ahayn mar walba.
They will believe me	Way i rumaysan doonaan
There are always new things to learn.	Had iyo jeer waxaa jira waxyaabo cusub oo la barto.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
And, as you know, you can do this.	Iyo, sida aad ogtahay, waxaad samayn kartaa tan.
Everything else is correct.	Wax kasta oo kale waa sax.
More than clear.	Wax ka badan cad.
This is every day, too.	Tani waa maalin kasta, sidoo kale.
It should.	Waa in .
I didn't have time for this.	Wax waqti ah uma helin arrintan.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
She found out she was happy, really.	Waxay ogaatay inay ku faraxsan tahay, run ahaantii.
He is one of us.	Waa mid naga mid ah.
I didn't understand much.	Wax badan ma fahmin.
And maybe you.	Oo malaha adiga.
But there is more, more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan, wax ka badan.
I'm the only one here.	Waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee halkan.
I didn’t get that.	Anigu ma aan helin sidaas.
Only me and you.	Kaliya aniga iyo adiga.
I think he is better than that.	Waxaan filayaa inuu taas ka fiican yahay.
He said there was nothing new in it.	Wuxuu sheegay in aysan ku jirin wax cusub.
It was not right.	Wax sax ah ma ahayn.
It was a long time.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer.
I got out of there.	Halkaas ayaan ka soo baxay.
No one can talk.	Qofna lama hadli karo.
I only saw it once.	Mar kaliya ayaan arkay.
I thought it could happen to me.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay igu dhici karto.
It can't be right.	Sax ma noqon karto.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
Not available now	Hadda lama heli karo
Mostly so, but not always.	Inta badan waa sidaas, laakiin had iyo jeer maaha.
Sorry about that, everyone.	Waan ka xumahay taas, qof walba.
You always are.	Had iyo jeer waxaad tahay.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
Now he would pay for something else.	Hadda wax kale ayuu bixin lahaa.
It still looks new, too.	Weli waxay u egtahay mid cusub, sidoo kale.
It was something everyone could do.	Waxay ahayd wax qof walba samayn karo.
I could not find anything to say.	Wax aan u sheego maan helin.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Hadda ma aha, laga yaabaa in aanay mar dambe.
Take it once.	Hal mar qaado.
They may not know it better.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay si ka wanaagsan u garanayn.
Like new.	Sida cusub.
That is the minimum.	Taasi waa waxa ugu yar.
I wonder what we do together.	Waa iga yaab waxa aan isku samayno.
I wanted to know what to do.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado waxa la sameeyo.
It will be very much.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u badan.
Anything you may need	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan karto
No one has found it yet.	Qofna weli ma helin.
He told her.	Wuxuu u sheegay.
I just need someone to talk to.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay qof aan la hadlo.
I'm glad he's here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu halkan joogo.
He got a hard job.	Waxa uu helay shaqo adag.
I'm not sure why that would be.	Ma hubo sababta ay taasi noqon doonto.
I decided that was enough for me.	Waxaan go'aansaday in igu filan.
He would give it more time.	Wuxuu siin lahaa waqti badan.
You can also help if you want.	Waxaad sidoo kale caawin kartaa haddii aad rabto.
This will give him something to work on.	Tani waxay siin doontaa wax uu ku shaqeeyo.
Once, once.	Mar, hal mar.
Several good jobs as well.	Dhowr shaqo oo wanaagsan sidoo kale.
Not sure how to do it	Ma hubo sida loo sameeyo
Now it’s like a job.	Hadda waa sida shaqo.
That is all he needs to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee uu u baahan yahay inuu ogaado.
As she did to me.	Sida ay igu samaysay.
There is nothing else.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo jira.
I have nothing else to tell you today.	Wax kale oo aan maanta kuu sheego ma hayo.
I refused anything.	Waxba waan diiday.
But no one came out.	Laakiin qofna ma soo bixin.
No one is real.	Qofna dhab uma aha.
It will never be the same again.	Mar dambe ma noqon doonto sidii hore.
Not paying much.	Aan wax badan bixin.
Why you don't get anything.	Sababta aadan waxba u helin.
Now a good one.	Hadda mid wanaagsan.
But now we are not ready.	Laakiin hadda diyaar ayaan ahayn.
I have to see.	Waa inaan arko.
Something else clearly happened.	Wax kale ayaa si cad u dhacay.
No matter what you did yesterday.	Dhib malaha waxaad shalay samaysay.
But you will be fine.	Laakiin waad fiicnaan doontaa.
I will go and do something very good.	Waxaan aadi doonaa oo sameyn doonaa wax aad u fiican.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
She would be gone soon.	Mar dhow way tagi lahayd.
She did it for us.	Way nagu samaysay.
I don't know that.	Ma garanayo taas.
He could not do that.	Taas wuu ku samayn waayay.
In fact, it is very beautiful.	Dhab ahaantii, waa mid aad u qurux badan.
Someone took money at the new door.	Qof ayaa lacag ku qaatay albaabka cusub.
I know you are really busy.	Waan ogahay inaad runtii mashquul tahay.
All you need is a few of them.	Waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay waa dhowr ka mid ah.
He said we will win.	Waxa uu yidhi waan guulaysan doonaa.
He was the best.	Wuxuu ahaa kan ugu fiican.
It will only take a long time.	Kaliya waxay qaadan doontaa waqti badan.
That’s because they love what they do.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah waxay jecel yihiin waxay sameeyaan.
It's a great idea.	Waa fikrad aad u fiican.
It is the best.	Waa waxa ugu wanaagsan.
Everyone.	Dadka oo dhan.
It was an unbelievable place.	Waxay ahayd meel aan la rumaysan karin.
He gave me nothing.	Waxba ima siin.
I saw him.	waan arkay isaga.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
And what.	Iyo maxaa .
I had to get to know you first.	Waxay ahayd inaan marka hore ku barto.
This is probably why you can't get anything right now.	Tani waxay u badan tahay sababta aadan hadda waxba u heli karin.
Now I got it.	Hadda waan helay.
I will tell him something.	Wax baan u sheegi doonaa.
This can be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa runtii.
I'm sure no one else will.	Waxaan hubaa in qof kale uusan sameyn doonin.
It really is unbelievable.	Runtii waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
This is really a good thing.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa wax wanaagsan.
You told us.	Waad noo sheegtay.
She should have been happy.	Waxay ahayd inay faraxsan tahay.
He told us that, and much more.	Wuxuu noo sheegay in, iyo wax badan oo kale.
It can be done.	Waa la samayn karaa.
How can this be ?.	Sidee tani noqon kartaa?.
That may not be what you want.	Taasi ma noqon karto waxa aad rabto.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah malaha.
I asked them not to.	Waxaan ka codsaday in aanay.
He always has and will always be.	Had iyo jeer wuxuu leeyahay oo had iyo jeer doonaa.
He may be a better person.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu noqdo qof ka wanaagsan.
She is really happy.	Runtii aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
The rest is the same.	Inta kale waa isku mid.
She needs me.	Waxay u baahan tahay in aan.
It's bad, it's very, very bad.	Way xun tahay, aad iyo aad bay u xun tahay.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
A little but interesting.	Wax yar laakiin xiiso leh.
That's how it is done.	Taasi waa sida loo sameeyo.
I would not win.	Ma aan guulaysan lahaa.
I can do a lot	Wax badan ayaan samayn karaa
Please, take it	Fadlan, qaado
Everything in it is amazing.	Dhammaan waxa ku jira waa yaab.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
It just won’t be.	Kaliya ma ahaan doono.
He does this for everyone.	Qof walba ayuu tan u sameeyaa.
Something happened to me.	Wax baa igu dhacay.
I will help.	Waan caawin doonaa.
But now was not a good time.	Laakiin hadda wakhti fiican ma ahayn.
That certainly cannot be a lie.	Hubaal taasi been ma noqon karto.
She never saw him again.	Mar dambe ma ay arag.
This was not a good idea.	Tani ma ahayn fikrad wanaagsan.
I didn't need it.	Uma baahnayn.
It was too much already.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u badan mar hore.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay haysan.
That is a terrible thing.	Taasi waa wax aad u xun.
This needs to be discussed.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay in laga wada hadlo.
It looks like we can't get enough of it.	Waxay u egtahay inaanan heli karin wax nagu filan.
He is not smart.	Ma caqli badna.
It was the same for me.	Waxay ila ahayd isku mid.
We live in it every day.	Waxaan ku nool nahay maalin kasta.
She is very happy to be here.	Aad bay ugu faraxsan tahay inaan halkan ku joogo.
It was not the same as before.	Wax la mid ah kii hore ma ahayn.
Best of all.	Si ka wanaagsan oo dhan.
He always wanted to.	Waxa uu had iyo jeer doonayo.
It really is more than anyone can expect.	Runtii way ka badan tahay qof kastaa filan karo.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma hayo.
Maybe he is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu yahay.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha .
He knows people well.	Dadka si fiican ayuu u yaqaan.
Let's do that.	Aan samayno taas.
Only man.	Kaliya nin.
I never gave anything.	Weligay waxba ma siin.
I'm sure this is a terrible thing.	Waxaan hubaa in tani ay tahay wax aad u xun.
And it is not interesting.	Oo ma aha wax xiiso leh.
That is what we need.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
As he said.	Sida uu yiri .
Nothing has come yet.	Wax wali ma iman.
No one is there.	Qofna meesha ma joogo.
Everything will be done here soon.	Wax walba dhawaan ayaa halkan lagu qaban doonaa.
So far, nothing.	Ilaa hadda, waxba.
We would like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahayn .
They should not like it.	Waa in aanay jeclayn.
It was a very bad day, very long.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u xun, aad u dheer.
I have not been able to find it before.	Hore uma awoodin inaan helo.
She had.	Way lahayd.
That was previously said.	Markii hore sidaas ayaa loo sheegay.
He said something very good.	Wax aad u fiican buu yidhi.
We would also like to be able to stop.	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclaan lahayn inaan joojin karno.
So you can get it too.	Si aad sidoo kale u heli karto.
No one, really.	Qofna ma aha, dhab ahaantii.
Everyone heard.	Qof kastaa wuu maqlay.
I really don't know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
I wanted to be something, too.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo wax, sidoo kale.
That is what they are for.	Taasi waa waxa ay u yihiin.
I refused.	waan diiday.
Obviously, there is nothing you can do right now.	Sida iska cad, ma jiraan wax aad hadda samayn karto.
I felt something very strange.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad ula yaab leh.
That's fine.	Taasi waa iska fiican tahay.
In fact, he thinks he is lucky.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu u maleynayaa inuu nasiib badan yahay.
But the rest.	Laakiin inta kale.
I think it is very good.	Waxaan filayaa inay aad u fiican tahay.
I'm pretty sure that's it.	Waxaan aad u hubaa inay taasi tahay.
Hold several times at the same time.	Qabo dhowr jeer isku mar.
It's really bad.	Runtii aad bay u xun tahay.
I am busy here	halkan ayaan mashquul ku ahay
Still, no one else has spoken.	Weli, qof kale ma hadlin.
I can't leave.	Ma bixi karo.
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
This is very rare.	Tani aad bay u yar tahay.
I want as much as you want me.	Inta aad i rabto ayaan ku rabaa.
But there is even more controversy.	Laakiin waxaa jira xitaa in ka badan oo la isku haysto.
I would not say that now.	Taas hadda ma odhan lahaa.
It was a good opportunity.	Waxay ahayd fursad wanaagsan.
They love it.	Way jecel yihiin.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan,.
It was clearly now.	Waxay ahayd si cad hadda.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Ilaa hadda ma jirto.
You love it so much.	Aad baad u jeceshahay.
But it was set.	Laakiin waa la dhigay.
To.	Si ay u .
Didn't you get it? 	Miyaadan helin?
Certainly not for me.	Hubaal aniga ma ahaan lahayd.
Everyone seems happy enough.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan oo ku filan.
I'm not really sure.	Si dhab ah uma hubo.
I am a good man	waxaan ahay nin wanaagsan
This is for sure.	Tani waa hubaal.
I want to tell you .	waxaan rabaa inaan kuu sheego .
But it is me.	Laakiin waa aniga.
I really know this.	Runtii tan waan ogahay.
Either way this is done.	Si kasta oo tan loo sameeyo.
I promised.	Waxaan ballan qaaday.
Maybe a little less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax yar ka yar.
Unbeknownst to me, I could not stop.	Aan ogayn, ma joojin karo.
This is very complicated.	Tani waa mid aad u dhib badan.
He thought she could leave him after this.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inay isaga tagi karto tan ka dib.
You know he can't.	Waad ogtahay inuusan awoodin.
But you don't want to do that.	Laakiin ma rabto inaad taas samayso.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
I hope you do more.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad wax badan sameyso.
It's really great.	Runtii waa wax aad u fiican.
He was always there for me.	Mar walba wuu ii joogay.
I don't feel it.	Ma dareemayo.
Now I am back at work.	Hadda shaqada ayaan ku soo noqday.
You were at work.	Waxaad ahayd shaqada.
I do not know what to say.	Ma garanayo waxaan u sheego.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
This is what they do every day.	Tani waa waxa ay sameeyaan maalin kasta.
A lot of it is luck.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah waa nasiib.
They do little.	Wax yar bay sameeyaan.
I will not stay again, until there is nothing else available.	Ma sii joogi doono mar kale, ilaa aanay jirin wax kale oo la heli karo.
He didn't want her to know he knew.	Ma uu rabin in ay ogaato in uu garanayo.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
And he says.	Oo uu leeyahay.
You are a small person.	Waxaad tahay qof yar.
I hope that will not happen to me.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan taasi igu dhici doonin.
It will happen	Ku dhici doona
Very little time would have been done.	Waqti aad u yar ayaa wax lagu qaban lahaa.
I'm so glad you weren't.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaadan ahayn.
Unless they are.	Ilaa aanay ahayn.
And, we are fast and on time.	Oo, waxaan nahay degdeg iyo waqti.
He never came.	Waligiis ma iman.
He did not come.	Ma iman.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
I wish he.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu.
He may not even be there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan xitaa halkaas joogin.
Too much time.	Waqti aad u badan .
He must be who he is.	Waa inuu yahay qofka uu yahay.
I want to know more about this.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan ka ogaado arrintan.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
You don't have to go there.	Waa inaadan halkaas ku noqon.
He saw them all.	Wuu wada arkay.
Everything just exists.	Wax kasta oo kaliya ayaa jira.
It was all so beautiful.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
Which you have.	Taas oo aad leedahay.
He started to leave the room.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu qolka ka baxo.
Surely we can do better than this, he thought.	Waxaa hubaal ah inaan samayn karno wax ka wanaagsan tan, ayuu u maleeyay.
Real beauty, that’s for sure.	Qurux dhab ah, taasi waa hubaal.
He left there.	Halkaas ayuu ka baxay.
I don't want to see it tonight.	Ma rabo inaan arko caawa.
I love him the most.	isaga ayaan ugu jeclahay.
But that was something he didn't want.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wax uusan rabin.
You can go anywhere you want.	Waxaad tagi kartaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
I didn’t have it.	Maan lahayn aniga.
It can certainly be done but it will take time.	Dhab ahaantii waa la samayn karaa laakiin waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
He saw something.	Wax buu arkay.
And here.	Oo halkan.
Certainly there are.	Waxaa hubaal ah inay jiraan.
He felt something.	Wax buu dareemay.
That’s a lot of food.	Taasi waa cunto badan.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay wax la mid ah ma arag.
We are just.	Waxaan nahay kaliya.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
I saw it tonight.	Caawa ayaan arkay.
But they are difficult.	Laakiin way adag yihiin.
He was a good person.	Qof fiican buu ahaa.
She had to tell him what was coming.	Waxay ahayd inuu u sheego waxa soo socda.
I can barely see him.	Si dhib ah ayaan u arki karaa isaga.
You have to be able to be.	Waxaad tahay in aad noqon karto.
This is not interesting.	Tani ma aha wax xiiso leh.
They may not be friends.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn saaxiibo.
It’s a great place, a lot to do.	Waa meel aad u fiican, wax badan oo la sameeyo.
No matter what it was, it would have been better.	Dhib ma lahayn waxay ahayd, way fiicnaan lahayd.
He was the only person who said that.	Wuxuu ahaa qofka kaliya ee yidhi.
I'm sure they will find him.	Waxaan hubaa inay heli doonaan isaga.
No one understood me.	Qofna ima fahmin.
Someone said maybe, you know.	Qof baa yiri waa laga yaabaa, waad ogtahay.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
He will not be able to find a job.	Ma awoodi doono inuu shaqo helo.
But there is no way to know.	Laakiin ma jirto si loo ogaado.
I know enough to do it.	Waan ogahay ku filan oo aan sameeyo.
That is and it was fast for me.	Taasi waa oo waxay ii ahayd degdeg.
There is nothing surprising here.	Ma jiraan wax la yaab leh halkan.
That is, she did.	Taasi waa, way samaysay.
It is still small.	Weli wuu yar yahay.
It was all hard work.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
Right where he wants.	Isla meesha uu rabo.
I really wouldn’t say.	Runtii ma odhan doono.
He had nowhere else to go.	Ma lahayn meel kale oo uu aado.
We will see you all the time.	Waanu ku arki doonaa mar walba.
He did not come close.	Uma soo dhawaan.
She should know better, she really should.	Waa inay si fiican u ogaato, runtii waa inay.
We are even now, one.	Waxaan nahay xitaa hadda, mid ka mid ah.
Let's see them all at once.	Ha wada arko hal mar.
But not everyone.	Laakiin maaha qof walba.
Not yet.	Ma jiro weli.
We would get another one.	Mid kale ayaan heli lahayn.
You are what he did to you.	Waxaad tahay waxa uu ku sameeyay.
It is another day.	Waa maalin kale.
I never tell anyone.	Weligay cidna uma sheego.
He must have.	Waa in uu leeyahay.
I did not think that.	Ma malayn in.
It seems he has never been.	Waxay u egtahay inuusan waligiis ahayn.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
Everyone will tell you that.	Qof kasta ayaa kuu sheegi doona taas.
I'm sure it will improve over time.	Waxaan hubaa inay dib u soo fiicnaan doonto muddo ka dib.
This is everything.	Tani waa wax walba.
It looks beautiful	Waxay u egtahay qurux
He knew it wasn't true.	Wuu ogaa in aanay run ahayn.
He saw enough.	Wax ku filan ayuu arkay.
There is always someone.	Mar walba qof baa jira.
What a door, you think.	Waa maxay albaabka, waxaad u malaynaysaa.
No one is so smart.	Qof sidaas u caqli badan ma jiro.
Why so much money?	Waa maxay sababta lacag badan?.
In fact, it has to be bought.	Dhab ahaantii, waa in la iibsado.
I did the same to him.	sidaas oo kale ayaan ku sameeyay isaga.
He left again.	Mar kale ayuu ka baxay.
Maybe a friend will come to me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan saaxiib ii yimaado.
It was a difficult job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo dhib badan.
I'm sure he will succeed.	Waan hubaa inuu guulaysan doono.
He can do whatever he wants.	Wuxuu doono wuu samayn karaa.
Someone else came in.	Qof kale ayaa soo galay .
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
Maybe it’s too much for him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad ugu badan tahay isaga.
That's right.	Runtii waa sax.
I never took anything else.	Weligay wax kale uma qaadan.
I say stop.	Waxaan leeyahay jooji.
This can help.	Tani waxay ku caawin kartaa.
At first he could not speak.	Markii hore wuu hadli waayay.
You may tell me now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad hadda ii sheegto.
Everything else will happen in place.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa ku dhici doona meesha.
As you said.	Sida aad sheegtay.
You can't have anything that is nothing.	Ma haysan kartid wax aan waxba ahayn.
I won't say much.	Wax badan kama odhan doono.
And why now.	Iyo sababta hadda.
He needs to work well.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu si fiican u shaqeeyo.
This is a very small place.	Tani waa meel aad u yar.
Something had to be done, quickly.	Wax ay ahayd in la sameeyo, oo degdeg ah.
He did not want to tell another lie.	Ma rabin inuu been kale sheego.
I don't like the big room here.	Ma jecli qolka weyn ee halkan.
I don't see it anywhere.	Ma arko meel u dhow.
That is better.	Taas ayaa ka fiican.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
He started just one year.	Waxa uu bilaabay kaliya hal sano.
Everyone loves it.	Qof walba waxa uu jecel yahay.
That is worse than anything else.	Taasi wax kasta oo kale ayaa ka xun.
That is all you need to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
There is only this.	Waxaa jira tan kaliya.
It can happen and it can happen now.	Way dhici kartaa oo way dhici kartaa hadda.
Busy, but happy	Mashquul, laakiin faraxsan
Another time.	Waqti kale.
That's what he does.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyo.
No one seems to know what happened.	Qofna uma eka inuu ogaado waxa dhacay.
But I did not get what I needed to help me.	Laakiin ma helin waxa aan u baahanahay si aan i caawiyo.
Just that.	Kaliya taas.
I made money for it first.	Lacag baan u sameeyay markii hore.
That is a great time.	Taasi waa waqti weyn.
It is what it is not.	Waa waxa aanay ahayn.
You did it yourself.	Adiga ayaa isku sameeyay.
It cannot be done all at once.	Isku mar lama qaban karo.
.	.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Maybe you too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale.
I'm sure this is.	Waan hubaa in tani ay tahay.
I would like to know	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado
Very long.	Aad u dheer.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u wanaagsan yahay.
But so much more.	Laakiin si aad u badan.
He was robbed.	Wuu la dhacay.
He always has.	Mar walba wuu leeyahay.
But there is something wrong.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax aan sax ahayn.
I have to love it	Waa inaan jeclahay
That is difficult.	Taasi waa mid adag.
It was small.	Wax yar buu ahaa.
At first, he looked great.	Marka hore, wuxuu u muuqday mid weyn.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
It was a beautiful place there.	Waxay ahayd meel qurux badan halkaas.
He came up with a lot of money.	Lacag aad u weyn ayuu la soo baxay.
This is really beautiful.	Tani runtii waa mid aad u qurux badan.
I just don’t like it anymore.	Kaliya mar dambe kuma jecli.
And going.	Oo u socda.
You can return home if you want.	Waxaad ku noqon kartaa guriga haddii aad rabto.
There is no other way to see things.	Ma jirto si kale oo wax loo arko.
It's hard to pick up.	Waa wax adag in la soo qaado.
I would really like to know more about you.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan kaa ogaado.
I said nothing else.	Wax kale ma odhan.
Not an idea.	Maaha fikrad.
No one knows where he is.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu joogo.
You may want a place near work.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto meel shaqo u dhow.
He got what he wanted, he took it.	Wuxuu helay wuxuu rabay, wuu u qaaday.
I need something new.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax cusub.
This is all I want.	Tani waa waxa kaliya ee aan rabo.
Still at the same time.	Weli isku waqti.
That's all he does.	Waa waxa uu sameeyo oo dhan.
He needs a lot of work.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay shaqo badan.
Which is not the case.	Taas oo aan la mid ahayn.
He was much harder than that.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad uga adag taas.
But that may not be a good idea.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto fikrad fiican.
Not too early.	Ma aha goor hore.
It was all people.	Waxay ahayd dhammaan dadka.
For a very long time	Muddo aad u dheer
I didn't have time for that.	Waqti uma helin taas.
A bit quick.	Xoogaa degdeg ah.
I was ready to tell you everything.	Waxaan diyaar u ahaa inaan wax walba kuu sheego.
What a bad idea.	Maxaa fikrad xun.
Only here.	Kaliya halkan.
This is a whole new problem.	Tani waa dhibaato cusub oo dhan.
I want to be able to do something.	Waxaan rabaa inaan awoodo inaan wax sameeyo.
From the largest to the smallest.	Ka ugu weyn ilaa kan ugu yar.
He is with me.	Wuu ila joogaa.
Maybe too.	Sidoo kale laga yaabaa.
That is not yet known.	Taas ilaa hadda lama garanayo.
It has always been so.	Had iyo jeer sidaas bay ahayd.
That is me and you.	Taasi waa aniga iyo adiga.
Take it here.	Ay ku qaado halkan.
It’s everything there.	Waa wax walba halkaas.
But now he felt something else.	Laakiin hadda wax kale ayuu dareemay.
But not today.	Laakiin maanta maaha.
It looks very long.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u dheer.
No one should be able to do that.	Qofna waa inuusan awoodin inuu sidaas sameeyo.
I'm sorry, he said.	Waan ka xumahay, ayuu yidhi.
It certainly is good for me.	Waxaa hubaal ah in ay aniga ii wanaagsan tahay.
It is like this.	Waxa la mid ah tan.
He doesn't want to go home with me.	Ma rabo inuu guriga ila tago.
Apparently he was trying to help.	Waxa cad in uu isku dayay in uu ku caawiyo.
You are very smart.	Aad baad u caqli badan tahay.
I will not take it.	Ma qaadan doono.
Here, let me help you.	Halkan, aan ku caawiyo.
He thought it was too big.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in ay aad u weyn.
This can be a good thing.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax fiican.
That is fine.	Taasi waa si fiican.
I think that’s really too much.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi runtii aad u badan tahay.
He did not know who they were.	Ma uu garanayn cidda ay yihiin.
Everyone thinks this is an amazing thing for someone to do.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay wax la yaab leh qof inuu sameeyo.
Now she can't find it.	Hadda way heli weyday.
I just started.	Hadda ayaan bilaabay.
Something happened to what happened.	Wax baa ka dhacay wixii dhacay.
That was all the man needed.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhammaan nin loo baahan yahay.
He did it for me once.	Hal mar ayuu ii sameeyay.
I love having it	Waan jeclahay in aan hayo
It's amazing and familiar.	Waa yaab oo la yaqaan.
I could not go far.	Meel dheer ma aadi karin.
Maybe they will.	Malaha way yeeli doonaan.
I'm glad you're happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad faraxsan tahay.
Very bad too.	Mid aad u xun sidoo kale.
I hope someone can help me here.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof halkan igu caawin karo.
Not all.	Dhammaan maaha.
It's just great.	Way weyn tahay oo kaliya.
It was bad.	Wax xun bay ahayd.
He is very serious to me.	Aad buu ii dhab yahay.
Not always.	Mar walba ma jirto.
He should not.	Ma ahayn inuu.
It doesn’t really work.	Si dhab ah uma shaqeeyo.
It’s money, money, money.	Waa lacag, lacag, lacag.
I would love to see you there !.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko halkaas!.
Let me tell you.	Aan kuu sheego.
Not so much, but a little.	Ma aha wax aad u badan, laakiin wax yar.
Tell her it is urgent.	U sheeg inay degdeg tahay.
I started.	Waan ka bilaabay.
Today it is.	Maanta waa .
He may have said so.	Waxa laga yaabaa in uu sidaas yidhi.
he loves me.	wuu i jecel yahay .
Very little, even.	Si aad u yar, xitaa.
We were not true.	Waxaan ahayn run.
Everyone is beautiful about that.	Qof kastaa wuu ku qurux badan yahay taas.
It can take an amazing amount of time.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti aad u la yaab leh.
He also did something.	Waxa kale oo uu wax ka dhigay.
That I could not do now.	Taas hadda ma aan samayn karin.
It would be a problem.	Waxay noqon lahayd dhibaato.
This is how it is.	Tani waa sida ay tahay.
He felt something.	Wax buu dareemay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
Maybe, he thought it was right.	Malaha, wuxuu mooday inay sax tahay.
She said she was not.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay ahayn.
.	.
I didn't pay anything.	Waxba maan ka bixin.
The reason for this is still unknown.	Sababta arrintan ayaan ilaa hadda la garanayn .
He always did.	Had iyo jeer wuu sameeyay.
I will not see him again.	Mar dambe ma arki doono.
He will return to work there.	Waxa uu ku noqon doonaa shaqada halkaas.
Not everyone.	Ma ahayn qof walba.
It was all very hard work.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd shaqo aad u adag.
Maybe it will too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale noqon doono.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
I am not doing this.	Anigu ma samaynayo tan.
I was always ready.	Mar walba diyaar baan ahaa.
Obviously I don't want to do this.	Sida iska cad ma rabo inaan tan sameeyo.
It's not like she's lost.	Ma aha sidii inay wayday.
She was happy.	Waxay ahayd mid faraxsan.
He really liked it.	Aad ayuu uga helay.
Nothing, either.	Waxba ma jiraan, sidoo kale.
This is an amazing time.	Tani waa waqti yaab leh.
It would be nice to do so.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in sidaas la sameeyo.
I can see it like yesterday.	Waxaan u arki karaa sidii shalay oo kale.
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
As he always would.	Sida uu had iyo jeer samayn lahaa.
It's the worst.	Waa tan ugu xun.
For me, it was great.	Aniga ahaan, aad bay ii ahayd.
It’s a little, really nothing.	Waa wax yar, run ahaantii waxba ma jiraan.
What could that be?	Maxay taasi noqon kartaa?.
I would not do that to keep my job.	Ma yeeli lahaa taas si aan shaqo u sii haysto.
And not just me, everyone.	Oo aniga kaliya maaha, qof walba.
I think that is for you to know.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi adiga kuu tahay inaad ogaato.
I hope they will do something good for you.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax fiican kuu qaban doonaan.
But there was no such thing.	Laakiin ma jirin wax la mid ah.
You can tell him to leave.	Waxaad u sheegi kartaa inuu baxo.
And not a few people.	Oo ma aha dhowr qof.
That was a good idea for you.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad fiican adiga.
This is why it stays.	Tani waa sababta ay u sii joogto.
Same.	La mid ah .
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
That you are in.	In aad ku jirto.
I hope it will continue.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sii ahaan doonto.
Definitely enough, there was.	Hubaal ku filan, waxaa jiray.
It will not stop.	Ma joojin doono.
That is an amazing promise he made.	Taasi waa ballan la yaab leh oo uu sameeyay.
She is happy.	Way faraxsan tahay.
But not so today.	Laakiin maanta sidaas maaha.
It can be a lie.	Waxay noqon kartaa been.
He was one of them.	Waxa uu ka mid ahaa.
Now that.	Hadda taas .
To talk.	In la wada hadlo.
Here is what will really happen.	Waa kan waxa runtii dhici doona.
I am always ready.	Mar walba diyaar ayaan ahay.
Now that is correct.	Hadda waa sax.
He is who he was.	Waa qofka uu ahaa.
You can leave at any time.	Waxaad ka bixi kartaa wakhti kasta.
It was also amazing.	Waxay sidoo kale ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
You can talk.	Waad hadli kartaa.
For more than one year.	Muddo ka badan hal sano.
You will deal with the latter.	Tan dambe ayaad wax ka qaban doontaa.
It is permanent.	Waa joogto.
That is why they do not know anything.	Taasi waa sababta aysan waxba garanayn.
He was happy.	Wuxuu ahaa mid faraxsan.
It was thought to be busy.	Waxaa loo maleeyay in ay tahay mashquul.
That sounds like more.	Taasi waxay u egtahay in ka sii badan.
It was not such a bad place.	Ma ahayn meel sidaas u xun.
I was always surprised.	Mar walba waan la yaabay.
No matter how small.	Si kasta oo ay u yar tahay.
There is very little work.	Ma jiro shaqo aad u yar.
This is probably not the case.	Tani malaha malaha.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
He really refused.	Runtii aad buu u diiday.
It is much better.	Aad bay uga fiican tahay.
That is a difficult thing to do.	Taasi waa wax ay adag tahay in la sameeyo.
He loves how we are.	Wuu jecel yahay sida aan u nahay.
Picked me up.	I soo qaaday.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay ugu adag tahay.
But there is a bit of this.	Laakiin waxaa jira xoogaa tan.
She needs you now.	Hadda way kuu baahan tahay.
Really, you would.	Runtii, waad sameyn lahayd.
He just wants to.	Kaliya wuu doonaa.
I will go to him '.	waan u tagi doonaa'.
I really hope you will find it back.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad dib u heli doonto.
Others.	Dadka kale.
Beautiful, very beautiful.	Qurux badan, aad u qurux badan.
You are the only one.	Waa adiga keligaa.
He came.	Wuu yimid.
This is the best.	Tani waa tan ugu fiican.
It doesn't look complicated.	Uma eka mid adag.
It looks new.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid cusub .
It's good for him.	Way u fiican tahay isaga.
It cannot be done.	Lama qaban karo.
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
I have no idea this.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin tan.
So he withdrew.	Sidaas ayuu dib uga noqday.
But no one is yet able to do this.	Laakiin qofna weli ma awoodo inuu tan sameeyo.
He has to talk to her.	Waa in uu la hadlo.
They still believe.	Weli way rumaysan yihiin.
Nothing to do.	Wax aan la samayn.
But if that is the only thing you can do.	Laakiin haddii ay taasi tahay waxa kaliya oo aad sameyn karto .
But for a while.	Laakiin in muddo ah.
That was new to me.	Taasi waxay ii ahayd mid igu cusub.
She knew she didn't want to.	Way ogaatay inaysan rabin.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
He will be fine	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa
He needs to see where he is.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu arko meesha uu joogo.
I love him	waan jeclahay isaga
I refused.	waan diiday.
A lot has happened to him.	Wax badan baa ku dhacay isaga.
It would be nice to leave.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaan baxo.
I'm happy to have it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan haysto.
And now, here it is.	Oo hadda, waa kan.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
But often it is not.	Laakiin inta badan maaha.
I don't speak now.	Hadda ma hadlo.
She did not speak again.	Dib uma aysan hadlin.
But it is always there.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waa halkaas.
No car arrived.	Baabuur kuma iman.
Did something happen to me?	Ma wax baa igu dhacay.
The few that are said are good.	Inta yar ee la sheego ayaa wanaagsan.
Don't talk! 	Ha hadlin!
.	.
I think that was a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
Although they probably do not yet know this.	In kasta oo ay u badan tahay in aanay weli taas ogayn.
Maybe you can help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad ku caawin karto.
We weren’t even.	Waxaan ahayn xitaa.
It must be the same.	Waa inuu jiraa isku mid.
But, really, it’s because he just wants to leave.	Laakiin, runtii, waa sababta oo ah wuxuu rabaa oo kaliya inuu baxo.
Today there is even less.	Maanta waxaa jira xitaa ka yar.
It was awful, but it was true.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun, laakiin run bay ahayd.
Don't, please, that.	Ha samayn, fadlan, taas.
You did.	Waad samaysay.
Not so here.	Halkan sidaas maaha.
They do, you know.	Way sameeyaan, waad ogtahay.
There are other, much better things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo aad uga wanaagsan.
I think it would be a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa inay noqon lahayd fikrad fiican.
This was beautiful.	Tani waxay ahayd qurux badan.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
He knew it was good for her.	Wuu ogaa inay u wanaagsan tahay.
That was, so far.	Taasi waxay ahayd, ilaa hadda.
It really didn't matter.	Runtii dhib ma lahayn.
It is enough that he did.	Waa ku filan tahay inuu sameeyay.
You had to do it.	Waxa ay ahayd in aad samayso.
I saw.	Waan arkay.
He had it well.	Si fiican ayuu u lahaa.
She was unable to help.	Ma awoodin inay caawiso.
Beautiful day.	Maalin qurux badan.
Maybe he'll get better.	Malaha wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
He will do this three more times.	Saddex jeer oo kale ayuu tan samayn doonaa.
I will tell him.	waan u sheegi doonaa.
it will not hurt.	waxba ma yeeli doono.
But she had.	Laakiin way lahayd.
He had no idea what was going on.	Waxa soo socda wax fikrad ah kama uu lahayn.
It is already true.	Waa run hore.
It’s how it always works.	Waa sida had iyo jeer loo shaqeeyo.
Very beautiful yet.	Aad u qurux badan weli.
This is a new opportunity.	Tani waa fursad cusub.
Can you believe it? ' 	Ma rumaysan kartaa?'
It will go.	Way tagi doontaa.
Maybe he could do more here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu halkan wax badan ka qaban lahaa.
Very, very good.	Aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
You will definitely get a lot of money here.	Waxaa hubaal ah inaad halkan ka heli doontaa lacag aad u badan.
It belongs to someone.	Qof baa iska leh.
You can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban kartid.
Everyone is ready to go.	Qof kastaa wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu tago.
This was what he wanted.	Tani waxay ahayd wixii uu rabay.
Let me get out of here.	Aan halkan ka soo baxo.
This is a great time to do it.	Tani waa wakhti aad u fiican in la sameeyo.
John received three of them.	Yooxanaa wuxuu helay saddex ka mid ah.
But it is faster than that.	Laakiin waa ka degdeg badan tahay taas.
There was nothing we could do about it.	Ma jirin wax aan ka qaban karno.
She definitely has one.	Hubaal mid bay leedahay.
This is always done.	Sidaas ayaa mar walba la sameeyaa.
We live for it.	Waxaan u nool nahay.
It may help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawiso.
I think it is not.	Waxaan filayaa in aanay ahayn.
Not until, well, very long.	Ma aha ilaa, si fiican, aad u dheer.
Definitely the one I love.	Dhab ahaantii waa kan aan jeclahay.
That is a lot of time.	Taasi waa waqti badan.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd .
Something came up.	Wax baa soo galay.
She really did.	Runtii taas way samaysay.
Not there.	Ma jiro halkaas .
I'm sure it's well known.	Waxaan hubaa in si fiican loo yaqaan.
I hope he gets the job.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu helo shaqada.
But they did not.	Laakiin sidaas kuma ay joogin.
I still think so.	Weli taas ayaan qabaa.
That is what we need.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
It was, at first, me.	Waxay ahayd, markii hore, aniga.
I think of others.	Waxaan u maleynayaa dadka kale.
But I must.	Laakiin waa in aan.
I can't believe he's serious.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu dhab ka yahay.
After everything happened.	Ka dib wax kasta oo dhacay.
I am not very sure.	Anigu mid aad uma hubo.
I didn't want to know anything.	Ma rabin inaan wax ogaado.
He wants that.	Taas ayuu rabaa.
Otherwise, he is alive.	Haddii kale, waa nool yahay.
Just not interesting you know.	Kaliya aan xiiso lahayn oo aad ogtahay.
You may not find it very good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan u helin mid aad u fiican.
He must have entered.	Waa inuu galay.
At first, he did not speak.	Marka hore, ma uusan hadlin.
I came back.	Dib ayaan u soo noqday.
Not too close but close enough.	Aad uma dhow laakiin ku filan dhow.
It's just.	Waxa kaliya.
Maybe that's what will happen.	Malaha waa waxa dhici doona.
But nothing big.	Laakiin wax weyn ma jiraan.
I just don’t know why.	Kaliya ma garanayo sababta.
Maybe it would be different.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay si kale ahaan lahayd.
I never knew who.	Weligay maan garanayn cidda.
She realized there was something.	Waxay ogaatay inay wax jiraan.
I need to leave the house	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ka baxo guriga
This is how it looks.	Tani waa sida ay u egtahay.
I felt it.	waan dareemay.
I can tell you it was great.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa inay ahayd wax weyn.
And maybe he knew that.	Oo malaha wuu ogaa taas.
It is so bad that not everyone can get to do that.	Waxaa aad u xun inaan qof walba ku heli karin inuu taas sameeyo.
He did not return.	Dib uma uu noqon.
Ah, he said.	Ah, ayuu yidhi.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.	Berrito waa berri.
Even if you.	Xitaa haddii aad .
They do not have to do that.	Ma aha inay sidaas sameeyaan.
I'm afraid it was me.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inay aniga ahayd.
You should have known this in advance.	Waxay ahayd inaad tan hore u sii ogaato.
I never believed that.	Weligay taas ma rumaysan.
Maybe very close.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u dhow.
No one now.	Mid hadda ma jiro.
Maybe I should go	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan tago
Not just a favorite.	Ma aha oo kaliya mid jecel.
There was a lot of bad stuff.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo badan oo xun.
There may be nothing that anyone can do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan jirin wax qofna samayn karo.
What is it after all? 	Muxuu yahay ka dib oo dhan?
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
There was little difficulty	Waxaa jiray dhib yar
I will not say anything to anyone.	Qofna waxba ku odhan maayo.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
For me, that is.	Aniga ahaan, taasi waa.
Like even a little.	Sida xitaa wax yar.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor sidaas oo kale.
But you know.	Laakiin waad ogtahay.
We wouldn’t get much.	Wax badan ma heli lahayn.
He thinks he knows.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inuu garanayo.
You will be very happy.	Waxaad noqon doontaa mid aad u faraxsan.
I love working there.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan ka shaqeeyo halkaas.
We are ready for that.	Taas diyaar ayaan u nahay.
She told me to stay.	Waxay ii sheegtay inaan la joogo.
Not in the same place.	Isku meel maaha.
He was there, he was there.	Wuu joogay, wuu joogay.
So far nothing.	Ilaa hadda waxba.
Several of them.	Dhowr ka mid ah.
I should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si fiican u garanayo.
But that may not be the case.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan taasi ahayn.
I hope it is.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay tahay.
You are good.	Waad fiican tahay.
They do not do everything.	Wax walba ma sameeyaan.
There is food for everyone.	Waxaa jira cunto qof walba.
Maybe a little more interesting.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xoogaa yar oo xiiso leh.
I have nothing to say.	Wax aan sheego ma helin.
This is now.	Tani waa hadda.
he refused.	wuu diiday.
she will say.	waxay odhan doontaa.
He was the same.	Wuxuu ahaa isku mid.
I can do this.	Waan samayn karaa tan.
Everyone was in it.	Qof kastaa wuu ku jiray.
I don't want you.	kuma rabo adiga.
I hope someone can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof uu ku caawin karo.
If nothing better.	Haddii aysan jirin wax ka fiican.
This is what you know.	Tani waa waxa aad ogtahay.
In fact, really.	Dhab ahaantii, si dhab ah.
In fact, it does not matter.	Dhab ahaantii, waxba maaha.
It really is here.	Runtii waa halkan.
But it's better if you don't.	Laakiin way fiican tahay haddii aadan samayn.
I wouldn’t give a damn about it.	Wax yar ma siin lahaa si aan u ogaado.
He wanted to be with her.	Wuxuu rabay inuu la joogo.
No one knows this.	Qofna kuma barto kan.
Now it is.	Hadda waa .
I didn't have time for this.	Waqti uma helin tan.
I am happy now	hadda waan faraxsanahay
I refused to go there again.	Waan diiday inaan mar kale halkaas tago.
You have a problem here	Adiga ayaa dhib kugu ah halkan
Postponed.	Dib ayaa loo dhigay.
Everyone was there.	Qof kastaa wuu joogay.
He came back to see it.	Dib ayuu u soo noqday si uu u arko.
That is not how it is.	Taasi maaha sida ay tahay.
He could not leave.	Wuu ka bixi waayay.
Whatever it was, it could not be better.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd, ma fiicnaan karto.
He was and is a man.	Wuxuu ahaa oo waa nin.
Probably everything.	Malaha wax walba.
And it looks like I will get it too.	Oo waxay u egtahay in aan sidoo kale heli doono.
I have no money.	Lacag ma haysto.
I always liked him.	Had iyo jeer waan ka helay isaga.
You have a great day tomorrow.	Waxaad leedahay maalin weyn berrito.
Not one other person was present.	Hal qof oo kale ma joogin.
They are so bad.	Aad bay u xun yihiin.
Not sure how to do it.	Ma hubo sida aan sameeyo.
She needs something.	Wax bay u baahan tahay.
Will this happen?	Tani ma dhici doontaa?.
We will not leave until we are found.	Ma bixi doono ilaa nala helo.
I know it was.	Waan ogahay inay ahayd.
I just want to help	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan caawiyo
Pay someone to do it.	Lacag bixi qof si uu u sameeyo.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
You are still beautiful.	Weli waad qurux badan tahay.
He does not want to know.	Ma rabo inuu ogaado.
I have no one to talk to.	Qof aan la hadlo ma hayo.
.	.
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
I lost everything.	Wax walba waan waayay.
I don't know what to expect.	Waxa uu filan karo ma garanayo.
I did not want to do this.	Anigu ma rabin inaan tan sameeyo.
We can't do enough.	Wax nagu filan ma qaban karno.
No one could do this.	Qofna ma uu qaban karin arrintan.
I would like you to stay.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad joogto.
We are almost ready	Waxaan ku dhow nahay diyaar
You will see this.	Waxaad ku arki doontaa tan.
But that's fine.	Laakiin taasi way fiican tahay.
But even that is uncertain.	Laakiin xitaa taasi lama hubo.
But not for long.	Laakiin ma aha muddo dheer.
No one knew.	Qofna ma ogayn.
No food was provided.	Ma jirin wax cunto ah oo la siiyay.
How is that, you say ?.	Sidee taasi tahay, waxaad leedahay?.
malaha.	malaha.
This is great.	Tani waa mid weyn.
You can't pay for something you don't have.	Wax aadan haysan ma bixin kartid.
Less than others.	Si ka yar dadka kale.
You must not say.	Waa inaadan odhan.
That’s the only thing she does, you know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay sameyso, waad ogtahay.
He gave it a chance, one chance.	Waxa uu siiyay fursad, hal fursad.
Good day now.	Maalin wanaagsan hadda.
I will not let him.	Ma ogolaan doono isaga.
It will not take him.	Ma qaadan doonto isaga.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
I was there	waan joogay
Strictly speaking, this is true.	Marka si adag loo hadlo, tani waa sax.
It's a bad place.	Waa meel xun.
It was to help.	Waxay ahayd in la caawiyo.
I hope to see you again soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko dhawaan.
This is probably the biggest.	Tani malaha waa tan ugu weyn.
But one day.	Laakiin maalin.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
He was very bad, and would have been very small.	Aad buu u xun yahay, oo wuxuu ahaan lahaa mid aad u yar.
Here is why.	Waa kan sababta.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I know it's not.	Waan ogahay in aysan ahayn.
He is one of them.	Isaga ayaa ka mid ah.
I was surprised he was still alive.	Waxaan la yaabay inuu weli nool yahay.
I looked good.	Si fiican ayaan u eegay.
Who came out.	Yaa soo baxay .
She really didn't want to cause any problems.	Runtii ma rabin inay wax dhibaato ah samayso.
They love me.	Way i jecel yihiin.
We will make time.	Waqti ayaan sameyn doonaa.
But, it is true.	Laakiin, waa run.
That is a lot.	Taasi waa wax badan.
Not too big.	Aad uma weyn.
He was there all.	Wuu joogay oo dhan.
he will return to you.	wuu kuu soo noqon doonaa.
It is new.	Waa cusub.
I looked	waan eegay
He is not who we are.	Ma aha qofka aan nahay.
I want to see what, if any, he will say.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko waxa, haddii ay jiraan, uu odhan doono.
I cant.	Ma awoodo.
I am not a tough person.	Anigu ma ihi qof adag.
He still could not see.	Weli ma uu arki karin.
And a few of us.	Iyo in yar oo naga mid ah.
Not until this is done.	Ma aha ilaa tan la sameeyo.
It was real to me.	Way iga dhab ahayd.
I really like that.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay taas.
It was very lively, very lively, and so on.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u nool, aad u nool, oo la mid ah.
Well done.	Si wanaagsan ayaa ah.
So far, he has been clear.	Ilaa hadda, wuxuu ahaa mid cad.
This is also an interesting place.	Tani sidoo kale waa meel xiiso leh.
That was a lot of work.	Taasi waxay ahayd shaqo badan.
That should be sufficient enough for him.	Taas ayaa ku filan isaga.
I'm really happy about that.	Runtii waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
I told him.	waan u sheegay.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo taas loo samayn lahaa.
It's true .	Waa run .
All it takes is time.	Waxa ay u baahan tahay waa wakhti.
I know you are not.	Waan ogahay inaadan sidaas ahayn.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
She said she did not know.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay garanayn.
Now he wants to do it.	Hadda wuxuu rabaa inuu sameeyo.
He wants a lot of money.	Lacag badan ayuu rabaa.
This is exactly what happened.	Tani run ahaantii waxay ahayd wixii dhacay.
I think it's really smart.	Waxaan filayaa inay runtii caqli badan tahay.
There was a lot here.	Wax badan ayaa halkan ku jiray.
Now there is nowhere to go.	Hadda meel la aado ma jirto.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan.
If they do, fine.	Haddii ay sameeyaan, fiican.
He felt abandoned.	Waxa uu dareemay in laga tagay.
But you did it for me.	Laakiin waad ii samaysay.
It was still too early.	Weli waxay ahayd goor hore.
Everyone is ready to go.	Dhammaan waa diyaar in la tago.
Isn't this something to do.	Tani miyaanay waxba ahayn in la sameeyo.
Here is what it contains.	Waa kan waxa ku jira.
I need every man.	Waxaan u baahanahay nin kasta.
Maybe you can tell me.	Malaha waad ii sheegi kartaa.
Why, one wonders.	Waa maxay sababta, mid la yaab leh.
What is true for you is not true for everyone.	Waxa run kuu ah qof walba run maaha.
I have done it before.	hore ayaan u sameeyay.
I have nothing to do now.	Ma hayo wax aan sameeyo hadda.
I think it's all over.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhan tahay.
But nothing came of it.	Laakiin waxba uma soo bixin.
Little did he see that he did not.	In yar ayuu arkay in aanu samayn.
I never thought it would be.	Waligiis uma malaynayn inay noqon doonto.
After what she did.	Ka dib wixii ay samaysay.
I wanted to leave	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo
She should have known I needed it.	Waa inay ogaatay inaan u baahanahay.
I am really sorry about this.	Runtii aad ayaan uga xumahay arrintan.
You just need to know.	Ma u baahan tahay inaad ogaato kaliya.
I will get money to buy it again.	Waxaan heli doonaa lacag aan ku iibsado mar kale.
This is a very bad idea.	Tani waa fikrad aad u xun.
It is not very difficult.	Ma aha mid aad u adag.
It is everywhere and everywhere.	Waa meel iyo meel walba.
I didn’t say much about the whole job.	Wax badan ma sheegin shaqada oo dhan.
Definitely worth buying !.	Hubaal in la iibsado!.
That is what everyone has.	Taasi waa waxa qof kastaa leeyahay.
I don't get it now.	Hadda maan helin.
There is no money now.	Lacag hadda ma jirto.
This can be a problem.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa dhib.
I thought this might be interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay noqon karto mid xiiso leh.
I am so glad you did.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad samaysay.
I think he would be fine.	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan lahaa.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
You should be happy about this.	Waa inaad ku faraxsan tahay arrintan.
You are someone else.	Waxaad tahay qof kale.
He did not see the next one.	Ma uusan arag soo socda.
She is older than me.	Way iga weyn tahay.
Now, that is known.	Hadda, taasi waa la yaqaan.
They will tell you.	Way kuu sheegi doonaan.
This may have nothing to do with this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani aysan wax shaqo ah ku lahayn taas.
Not like what happened.	Ma aha sida wax dhacay.
It may not be true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan run ahayn.
I am here	waan joogaa
I wanted to make something to eat.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo wax aan cuno.
There is always tomorrow.	Mar walba waxaa jira berri.
Here and there and there.	Halkaas iyo halkaas iyo halkaas.
There is no problem here.	Halkan dhib kuma jirto.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
Three much smaller.	Saddex aad uga yar.
No more work.	Shaqo dambe ma jirto.
Where they live, to speak.	Meel ay ku nool yihiin, si loo hadlo.
I have to know now.	Waa inaan hadda ogaado.
I was not a friend.	Maan ahayn saaxiib.
That is the hard thing.	Taasi waa waxa adag.
She is with us.	Way nala joogto.
I would like to have something to eat	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan helo wax aan cuno
I left tomorrow	Berri ayaan ka baxay
He was here.	Wuu joogay halkan.
She would have to lie.	Waxay noqon lahayd inay been sheegto.
But she did not say so.	Laakiin sidaas ma ay odhan.
Many others were in prison with him.	In badan oo kale ayaa xabsiga kula jiray.
We'll see the rest tonight.	Waan arki doonaa inta kale caawa.
But much can be done.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa la qaban karaa.
In fact, that sounds like something else.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waxay u egtahay wax kale.
I have never done this.	Weligay tan ma samayn.
I have no idea that.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo taas.
Obviously not.	Sida iska cad ma aha.
For the most part, it was very good money.	Inta badan, waxay ahayd lacag aad u wanaagsan.
It is difficult to say what is going on.	Way adag tahay in la sheego waxa socda.
It has to work, hard.	Waa inuu shaqeeyo, adag.
I still hope so.	Weli waan rajeynayaa.
He is not a man.	Nin maaha.
He never spoke.	Waligiis ma uusan hadlin.
I went to him.	waan u aaday.
It can be done quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaa loo samayn karaa.
I am here to work for you.	Waxaan halkaan u joogaa inaan kuu shaqeeyo.
Good for close work.	U fiican shaqada dhow.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan.
I expect that.	taas ayaan filayaa .
I wonder what he wants.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa uu rabo.
But he knew it would happen.	Laakiin wuu ogaa in uu dhici doono.
It started badly.	Si xun buu u bilaabay.
It was fun for me.	Waxay ii ahayd mid xiiso leh.
I really didn't get a chance.	Runtii fursad ma helin.
I wonder what is in it.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ku jira.
That’s why it came out.	Taasi waa sababta uu u soo baxay.
I would definitely stay again.	Hubaal waan joogi lahaa mar kale.
Just what you want.	Kaliya waxaad rabto.
He is a great friend of mine.	Waa saaxiib weyn oo aan leeyahay.
But that was unthinkable.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wax aan la malayn karin.
They are very tall and very beautiful.	Aad bay u dheer yihiin oo aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
There is no such thing.	Ma jiraan wax sidaas oo kale ah oo kale.
A little surprising in this regard.	Wax yar ayaa la yaab leh arrintan.
But no one has done it yet.	Laakiin weli cidna ma samayn.
She could not believe it.	Way rumaysan weyday taas.
Always fast.	Had iyo jeer degdeg.
The whole school.	Dugsiga oo dhan.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
Wonder what this is.	La yaab waxa ay tani tahay.
There is no one like him.	Qof la mid ah ma jiro.
She said she would be back.	Waxay sheegtay inay dib u soo noqon doonto.
I had to get to know him.	Waxay ahayd inaan barto isaga.
It can be up to one year.	Waxay noqon kartaa ilaa hal sano.
You look like a favorite like him !.	Waxaad u egtahay mid la jecel yahay isaga oo kale!.
I want to know everything about him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ka ogaado isaga.
Obviously that is not here.	Sida iska cad taasi halkan maaha.
That's what you say.	Taasi waa waxa aad u sheegto.
This was good.	Tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I can't do that now.	Taas hadda maan awoodin.
I think he is there now.	Waxaan filayaa inuu hadda joogo.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
Food and more.	Cunto iyo wax kale.
This is enough for me.	Waxaa igu filan tan.
I love being there	Waxaan jeclahay inaan halkaas joogo
He no longer needed it.	Mar dambe uma uu baahnayn.
It doesn't look like much.	Wax badan uma eka.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
I will help you	waan ku caawin doonaa
You can leave us.	Waad naga tagi kartaa.
I will do that here	Taas ayaan ku samayn doonaa halkan
There was still something out there.	Weli wax baa ka jiray oo meesha ka baxay.
I never gave it to him.	Weligay maan siin isaga.
He looked so beautiful there.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u qurux badan halkaas.
He said maybe.	Waxa uu sheegay in laga yaabo.
But, you can be good.	Laakiin, si fiican ayaad u noqon kartaa.
This is a good idea.	Tani waa fikrad fiican.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Malaha taasi waa sida ay tahay.
Who, why, how.	Yaa, sababta, sidee.
It was an obvious problem.	Waxay ahayd dhib cad.
It will come here	Way iman doontaa halkan
Very, very early.	Aad iyo aad goor hore.
You are right, you are.	sax baad tahay, waad tahay.
There is nothing more beautiful.	Wax ka qurux badan ma jiro.
But no one else knows.	Laakiin qof kale ma garanayo.
I still have a lot of friends there.	Weli waxaan halkaas ku leeyahay saaxiibo badan.
That would be a problem.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd dhibaato.
Is it me? 	Ma aniga baa?
She was unemployed again.	Waxay ahayd shaqo la'aan mar kale.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
I think he needs time.	Waxaan filayaa inuu u baahan yahay wakhti.
I also like that people love me.	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclahay in dadka i jecel.
Here is one.	Waa kan mid.
I thought you would like it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeclaan lahayd.
Nothing to see there.	Ma jiraan wax halkaas lagu arko.
I can't do it again	Mar kale ma samayn karo
Too bad it's right.	Aad buu u xun yahay waa sax.
In fact, he never did.	Dhab ahaantii, waligiis ma uu samayn.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
It was what it was.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu ahaa.
And a lot of them are very good.	Oo wax badan oo ka mid ah ayaa aad u fiican.
I didn’t always do that.	Mar walba taas ma sameyn.
he will hold us.	wuu na qaban doonaa.
Everyone has always said so.	Qof kastaa waligiis sidaas buu lahaa.
You may not be able to talk.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan hadli karin.
He would like to be in prison.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu xabsiga ku jiro.
I will get it soon.	Waxaan heli doonaa dhawaan.
Available here.	Laga heli karo halkan.
Even if she doesn’t want to do it.	Xitaa haddii aysan rabin inay sameyso.
This is not how sometimes.	Tani ma aha sida mar mar.
John was.	John wuxuu ahaa.
Maybe it was the best.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ahayd tan ugu fiican.
He told me he was fine.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu fiican yahay.
This looks great.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
This did not stop him.	Tani ma aysan joojin isaga.
But I can't do it.	Laakiin ma samayn karo.
He is ready to speak.	Wuu diyaar u yahay inuu hadlo.
I will be a good man.	Waxaan noqon doonaa nin wanaagsan.
He asked her to help.	Wuxuu ka codsaday inay caawiso.
What is it .	Waa maxay .
But there was very little time.	Laakiin waxaa jiray waqti aad u yar.
I will even come to you, if that is what you need.	Xitaa waan kuu iman doonaa, haddii taasi ay tahay waxa aad u baahan tahay.
She did not want to be with him.	Ma ay rabin in ay la joogto.
I was just surprised.	Kaliya waan la yaabay.
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
I love you.	waan ku jeclahay adiga.
I don't want anything else.	Wax kale ma rabo.
He promised he would not do it.	Waxa uu u ballan qaaday in aanu yeeli doonin.
He looked good.	Si fiican buu u eegay.
A little quick time.	Waqti yar oo degdeg ah.
It is nothing new.	Wax cusub maaha.
I don't want to say.	Ma rabo inaan sheego.
It is not something we would be together.	Ma aha wax aanu wada joogi lahayn.
He didn't need to say.	Uma baahnayn inuu sheego.
Often not available	Inta badan lama heli karo
They may not be there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan halkaas joogin.
She should know where he is.	Waa in ay ogaato meesha uu joogo.
That is the same, and.	Taas way la mid tahay, iyo.
Anyone can come up with an idea.	Qof kastaa wuu la iman karaa fikrad.
It really was a very exciting time.	Runtii waxay ahayd wakhti aad u xiiso badan.
It has everything to do.	Waxay leedahay wax kasta oo la sameeyo.
And a man will say.	Oo nin baa odhan doona.
I just want it to be well said.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in si wanaagsan loo sheego.
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
You can tell me tomorrow.	Berri baad ii sheegi kartaa.
I want it now.	Waxaan rabaa hadda.
Like new to me.	Sida aniga igu cusub.
Give a little, take a little.	Wax yar sii, wax yar qaado.
You will come now.	Hadda waad iman doontaa.
It wasn't much.	Wax badan ma ahayn.
You will be there	Halkaas ayaad joogi doontaa
I still need it.	Wali waan u baahanahay.
I always do.	Mar walba waan sameeyaa.
And it was there ,.	Oo waxay ahayd halkaas,.
I get nothing.	waxba ma helo.
I've seen it more than once, you know.	In ka badan hal mar ayaan arkay, waad ogtahay.
It is always a day.	Had iyo jeer waa maalin.
I felt the same way.	Waxaan dareemay sidaas oo kale.
Maybe it was yesterday.	Malaha shalay bay ahayd.
Opportunity is what he wanted.	Fursad waa waxa uu rabay.
He has to get out the back door.	Waa inuu ka soo baxay albaabka dambe.
Whatever you do.	Wax kasta oo aad samayso.
It will.	Waa yeeli doonaa.
I do not understand why.	Ma fahmin sababta.
There was something else.	Wax kale ayaa jiray .
As always, I am.	Sida had iyo jeer, waxaan ahay.
No matter what we do.	Dhib malaha waxaan samayno.
That is what she needs now.	Taasi waa waxa ay hadda u baahan tahay.
He felt bigger.	Waxa uu dareemay ka weyn.
Take it one by one.	Mid mid u qaado.
He did not want to talk about it.	Ma uu doonayn inuu arrintan ka hadlo.
It was, now, a little before three.	Waxay ahayd, hadda, wax yar ka hor saddex.
This is so great, this is unbelievable.	Tani waa wax aad u weyn, tani waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
I have to tell you tonight.	waa inaan kuu sheego caawa.
This will take a lot of time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti aad u badan.
But you are older.	Laakiin waad ka weyn tahay.
The person could not be found	Qofka lama heli karin
I haven't found it yet.	Weli ma helin.
I still wonder what happened to him.	Weli waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa ku dhacay.
I think everyone sees it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba uu arko.
You are smart and smart.	Waxaad tahay caqli iyo caqli badan.
I wonder if that is not true.	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii aysan run ahayn.
Even one is too much.	Xitaa mid ayaa aad u badan.
Do they make good food?	Cunto fiican ma sameeyaan?.
I haven't seen much.	Wax badan maan arag.
Maybe he really is there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu runtii halkaas joogo.
That was something she would do.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax ay samayn lahayd.
He was a young man.	Nin yar buu ahaa.
I didn't want to go there.	Ma rabin in aan aado halkaas.
Unprecedented.	Si aan hore loo arag.
She should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inay si fiican u ogaato.
Let's do this again.	Aan mar kale samayno tan.
What a good man.	Waa maxay nin si fiican u fiican.
That is mostly what it is.	Taasi waa inta badan waxa ay tahay.
And, right.	Oo, sax.
I don't have time for anything else.	Wax kale waqti uma hayo.
I would help him.	waan caawin lahaa isaga.
He came to me.	Wuu ii yimid.
This was only one year.	Tani waxay ahayd hal sano oo kaliya.
That doesn't matter to me.	Taasi aniga waxba igama aha.
He was incapable.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aan awoodin.
He thinks this is a good idea.	Wuxuu qabaa in tani ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
There is so much to see and do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la arko oo la sameeyo.
Day, day.	Maalin, maalin.
He had a bad day.	Maalin xun ayuu lahaa.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
It's a good time.	Waqti fiican ayuu joogaa.
He did well.	Si fiican ayuu u sameeyay.
And everyone took it well.	Oo qof walba si fiican ayuu u qaatay.
That was before.	Taasi waxay ahayd ka hor.
Maybe even a friend leaves.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xitaa saaxiib la baxo.
It will come, it will come.	Waxa iman doona, iman doona.
I am surprised.	Aniga waa iga yaab.
Everyone loves it.	Qof walba waxa uu jecel yahay.
But there is more to this than that.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan tan.
She realized she couldn't stay.	Way ogaatay inaysan joogi karin.
I can't lie	Been ma sheegi karo
It was just a job.	Kaliya waxay ahayd shaqo.
Maybe it's too early.	Malaha waa hore.
I do not give	Anigu ma sii
He thought it was too bad.	Wuxuu u arkay inay aad uga xun tahay.
I will not stay here for long.	Ma sii joogi doono halkan waqti dheer.
I love this.	Waan jeclahay kan.
He has a friend he wants.	Waxa uu leeyahay saaxiib uu rabo.
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
That would be a bad thing.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa wax xun.
You don't need anything from me.	Waxba igama baahnid.
In fact, no one is sure.	Runtii, qofna ma hubo.
Both are great.	Labaduba waa weyn yihiin.
It had to be done quickly.	Waxay ahayd in si degdeg ah loo sameeyo.
It is also true.	Sidoo kale waa run.
He may say so too now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale hadda sheego.
Everyone seems to be happy.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
He got it hard.	Waxa uu helay si adag.
She would get it.	Way heli lahayd.
But there is nothing you can really do.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax aad runtii samayn karto.
I really don't know anymore.	Runtii mar dambe ma garanayo.
Maybe him, is it.	Malaha isaga, waa.
No one already knew.	Qofna hore uma ogayn.
I am not serious about this.	Anigu dhab kama ihi arrintan.
It might even be good for you.	Xitaa waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku fiican tahay.
They weren't there much.	Wax badan ma ay joogin.
This is great for me.	Tani waa wax weyn aniga.
I really don't know that.	Run ahaantii taas ma garanayo.
You will catch us.	Waad na qaban doontaa.
But he could not take his time.	Laakiin wuu qaadan waayay wakhti.
This is just going to be a lot of fun.	Tani kaliya waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
I got it.	Waxaan helay .
Nothing happened.	Ma jirto wax ku dhacay.
Significantly.	Si weyn.
Everyone went home.	Qof kastaa wuxuu aaday guriga.
We are still close friends.	Weli waxaan ahayn saaxiibo dhow.
Maybe that helps.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi ku caawiso.
i want to go	waxaan rabaa inaan tago
But something else, too.	Laakiin wax kale, sidoo kale.
I love learning new things	Waxaan jeclahay inaan barto waxyaabo cusub
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
This is exactly what she did.	Tani waa si sax ah waxa ay samaysay.
Do not talk to anyone.	Cidna ha la hadlin.
She was a good friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib wanaagsan.
It was the same as before.	Waxay u ahayd sidii hore oo kale.
Another may come.	Mid kale ayaa laga yaabaa inuu yimaado.
He was one, after all.	Waxa uu ahaa mid, ka dib oo dhan.
You may be unemployed.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad shaqo la'aan tahay.
I hope to see you again !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko!.
It was like another one.	Waxay ahayd sida mid kale.
Not that it was a good thing.	Ma aha in ay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
It was untrue.	Waxay ahayd wax aan run ahayn.
It’s smart, really.	Waa caqli badan tahay, dhab ahaantii.
But that is what it is.	Laakiin waa waxa ay tahay.
That is an urgent task.	Taasi waa shaqo degdeg ah.
Something very new for him.	Wax aad ugu cusub isaga.
And, even better, he knows how to get there.	Iyo, xitaa si ka sii fiican, wuu yaqaan sida loo tago halkaas.
And there was nothing bad we could do.	Oo ma jirin wax xun oo aan samayn karno.
I have to.	Waa inaan haysto.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I don't see a car.	Ma arko baabuur.
She could not say.	Ma ay is odhan wayday.
For sure now.	Inta la hubo hadda.
Do nothing.	Waxba ha qaban.
Now this is even more amazing.	Hadda waa tan ka sii yaab badan.
I want to see him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko isaga.
He promised me a lot.	Wax badan ayuu ii ballan qaaday.
But not here and now.	Laakiin halkan maaha iyo hadda.
This is interesting.	Tani waa mid xiiso leh.
They should not be together.	Waa inaysan wada joogin.
This is nothing new to me.	Tani aniga wax igu cusub maaha.
you lied to me.	been baad ii sheegtay.
What happened!.	Maxaa ku dhacay!.
Not for long.	Ma aha muddo dheer.
Everyone came to me.	Qof walba wuu ii yimid.
You just did it.	Kaliya sidaas ayaad samaysay.
If you really like it, you are happy.	Haddii aad si dhab ah u jeceshahay, waad ku faraxsan tahay.
It is not always visible.	Mar walba lama arki karo.
Today was clearly not a good day.	Maanta si cad ma ahayn maalin wanaagsan.
Runtii, really.	Runtii, runtii.
He really was.	Runtii wuu joogay.
But that's what it says.	Laakiin waa waxa ay leedahay.
But he thought he did.	Laakiin wuxuu mooday inuu sameeyay.
How hard he looked.	Sida adag uu u muuqday.
Ima ay stop.	Ima ay joojin.
I have to.	Waa inaan .
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
He will be here for a while.	Wax yar ayuu halkan joogi doonaa.
It must be seen somewhere	Waa in la arko meel
This is also difficult.	Tani sidoo kale waa adag tahay.
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
Obviously this is awful.	Sida iska cad tani waa mid aad u xun.
Ah, me! 	Ah, aniga!
Where is it now ?.	Aaway hadda?.
As it is.	Sida uu yahay.
He loves you so much.	Aad ayuu kuu jecel yahay.
I love work	Waan jeclahay shaqada
This was a lot of money.	Tani waxay ahayd lacag aad u badan.
I can't imagine what happened to me.	Ma malayn karo waxa igu soo dhacay.
I have no intention of finding out.	Wax niyad ah uma hayo inaan ogaado.
I tried well.	Si fiican ayaan isku dayay.
Good job too.	Shaqo fiican sidoo kale.
For me, everything is fine.	Aniga, wax walba waa ii fiican yihiin.
This we refused to do.	Tani waa diiday inaan samayno.
I would love to learn how to do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan barto sida loo sameeyo taas.
But so far not for a while.	Laakiin ilaa hadda ma aha in muddo ah.
That's not a bad thing!	Taasi wax xun maaha!.
I will take it.	Waan qaadan doonaa.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
That is a very, very strange idea.	Taasi waa fikrad aad iyo aad u yaab badan.
I have always been here.	Had iyo jeer halkan ayaan joogi jiray.
Let me see.	Aan arko .
She didn't tell him she loved him anymore.	Uma ay sheegin inay mar dambe jeceshahay.
I think it is something to do.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax la sameeyo.
Not bad, really.	Ma aha mid xun, runtii.
I didn't even see it coming.	Xitaa maan arag soo socda.
Just tell me where I can find you.	Kaliya ii sheeg meesha aan kaa heli karo.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ma garanayo waxa ku dhacay.
He is alone.	Waa keligiis.
There is only hard work.	Waxaa jira shaqo adag oo kaliya.
Something visible.	Wax la arki karo.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I have to do this.	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa.
Good food, too.	Cunto wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
I never really know.	Weligay runtii ma garanayo.
I should have picked this up maybe.	Waxay ahayd in aan tan soo qaado malaha.
That was a thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax.
No one can help now.	Qofna hadda ma caawin karo.
But it was not something to eat.	Laakiin ma ahayn wax la cuno.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
That's it.	Waa tan.
I will get one for you	Mid baan kuu heli doonaa
I hope it will be one.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu mid noqon doono.
I couldn't do it	Ma yeeli karin
Something for everyone.	Wax qof walba leh.
Not you.	Adiga ma aha.
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
But he gave nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma siin.
I don't know how that could be.	Ma garanayo sida ay taasi noqon karto.
Nothing yet, he decided.	Waxba weli, wuu go'aansaday.
Someone may be there soon.	Qof ayaa laga yaabaa inuu dhawaan halkaas joogo.
More surprising and more interesting.	Ka yaab badan oo ka xiiso badan.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
That was definitely quick.	Taasi hubaal waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
He knew there was no way out.	Wuu ogaa in aanay jirin meel laga baxo.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba uma aha.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
You can do whatever you want to do.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto in aad samayso.
I think so.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas tahay.
It just doesn’t seem right.	Kaliya uma eka mid sax ah.
I want the best.	Waxaan rabaa sida ugu fiican.
It was all the same.	Dhammaan isku mid bay ahayd.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax wanaagsan.
He's in a bit of a mood, you know.	Waxa uu ku jiraa xoogaa niyad ah, waad ogtahay.
This is to be expected.	Tani waa la filayaa.
I want something else.	Wax kale ayaan isaga rabaa.
I just wonder if anyone can help me.	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay haddii qof i caawin karo.
This was a bad thing.	Tani waxay ahayd wax xun.
You did the same.	Si la mid ah ayaad samaysay.
I could not get out of this.	Waan ka bixi waayay tan.
It doesn't matter to me.	Waxba aniga waxba igama aha.
He wanted more.	Wax badan buu rabay.
Not now.	Hadda ma aha.
This is also beautiful.	Tani sidoo kale waa qurux badan.
I do everything.	Wax kasta waan sameeyaa.
I couldn’t imagine going back.	Ma malayn karin in aan dib u soo noqon.
That was all she could say.	Taasi waxay ahayd inta ay ka odhan karto.
I started eating.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan wax cuno.
He told me he was sorry.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu ka xun yahay.
She can't let him see.	Ma ogolaan karto inuu arko.
He decided not to say that.	Waxa uu go'aansaday in aanu taas sheegin.
But, don't lie to me anymore.	Laakiin, mar dambe been ha ii sheegin.
She never returned.	Mar dambe halkaas kuma ay noqon.
He knows what we do.	Waxa aanu samayno wuu garanayaa.
It really is.	Runtii waa in.
You do not need a car here.	Halkan uma baahnid baabuur.
Maybe for a while.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in muddo ah.
This was lucky.	Tani waxay ahayd nasiib.
I was not a good man.	Maan ahayn nin wanaagsan.
That’s a lot of what it is.	Taasi waa wax aad u badan waxa ay tahay.
I would like to know better	Waxaan jeclahay in aan si fiican u ogaado
It looks bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Very, very beautiful.	Aad iyo aad u qurux badan.
It could be again.	Waxay noqon kartaa mar kale.
That's fine and good.	Taasi waa si fiican oo wanaagsan.
That is what you want.	Taasi waa waxa aad rabto.
He should have known that to me.	Waxay ahayd inuu taas igu ogaado.
Now, it is not available.	Hadda, lama heli karo.
You haven't seen anything yet.	Weli waxba ma aadan arag.
That's what you do.	Taasi waa waxa aad u sameyso.
I had to find out.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax ka ogaado.
It is better than before.	Way ka fiican tahay sidii hore.
Something was amazing.	Wax si la yaab leh u ahaa.
More than me.	Wax iga sii badan.
It was very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan.
Let me work on it.	Aan ka shaqeeyo.
And, really, you would have done better.	Iyo, runtii, waxaad samayn lahayd si ka wanaagsan.
Certainly not everything that is going on right now.	Dhab ahaantii maaha wax kasta oo hadda socda.
It will surprise you.	Waxay ku qaban doontaa yaab.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
He seemed to have nothing else to say.	Waxa uu u muuqday in aanu jirin wax kale oo uu sheego.
It is a promise.	Waa ballan.
She would do that.	Way samayn lahayd taas.
It’s him, it’s right.	Waa isaga, waa sax.
I didn’t want to see that again.	Ma aanan rabin inaan mar kale arko taas.
I think you have one.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad mid leedahay.
I can't see him.	Ma arki karo isaga.
And it doesn't look like a big day.	Oo uma eka inuu maalin ka weyn yahay.
Maybe we can pick it up soon.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan dhawaan soo qaadan karno.
He holds me.	Wuu ii hayaa.
As to be seen.	Sida in la arko.
I already had that.	Hore ayaan u lahaa taas.
There was no great urgency.	Degdeg weyn ma jirin.
It was said.	Waa la odhan jiray.
It is difficult to do good.	In wax wanaagsan laga sameeyo waa adag tahay.
You can't tell anyone.	Qofna uma sheegi kartid.
Not too big, not too small.	Aad uma weyn, ma yar.
Everyone will love this one.	Qof kastaa wuu jeclaan doonaa kan.
I tried everywhere.	Meel walba waan isku dayay.
We are the same.	Waxaan nahay isku mid.
It's an interesting idea.	Waa fikrad xiiso leh.
This was a lot.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan.
They are very friendly.	Aad bay u saaxiib yihiin.
I'm sure everything will turn out well.	Waxaan hubaa in wax walba ay si fiican u soo bixi doonaan.
I love it all.	Waan jeclahay dhammaan.
All alone.	Dhammaan keligaa.
Something had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in wax la sameeyo.
What happened, happened.	Maxaa dhacay, dhacay.
There is nothing more difficult.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii adag.
For the most part, it wasn’t.	Inta badan, ma aysan ahayn.
Even today, it is a very popular food.	Xitaa maanta, waa cunto aad loo jecel yahay.
You would do it, you said.	Waad samayn lahayd, waxaad tidhi.
I thought that was not a good idea.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi aysan ahayn fikrad wanaagsan.
I will not do that.	Taas ma samaynayo.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
And, nothing.	Oo, waxba kuma jiraan.
He looked back.	Dib ayuu u eegay.
And everyone thought it was long.	Oo qof kastaa wuxuu mooday inay dheer tahay.
I am in whatever you want.	Waxaan ku jiraa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
That would be great for me.	Taasi waxay aniga ii ahaan lahayd wax weyn.
It can't hurt you	Waxba kuma yeeli karo
More will come soon	Wax badan ayaa iman doona dhawaan
He likes to talk.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu hadlo.
That is what it was.	Taasi waa waxa ay ahayd.
What is it for you?	waa maxay adiga?.
No one is talking.	Qofna lama hadlo.
I have no intention of doing that.	Wax niyad ah uma hayo inaan taas sameeyo.
I really am for him.	Runtii isaga ayaan u ahay.
That’s why we do it.	Taasi waa sababta aan u samayno.
We are still new.	Weli waan cusub nahay.
I think it's good for me.	Waxaan filayaa inay aniga ii fiican tahay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
He looked at this.	Wuu eegay tan.
She is not able to do this.	Ma awoodo inay tan samayso.
It was a good day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
I am a lucky person.	Waxaan ahay qof nasiib leh.
I thought it was weird.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu yaab leh.
Obviously this was.	Sida cad tani waxay ahayd.
Lots of really good stuff.	Waxyaabo badan oo runtii aad u wanaagsan oo aad u wanaagsan.
Very beautiful and really affordable.	Aad u qurux badan oo run ahaantii la awoodi karo.
When done well this is great.	Marka si fiican loo sameeyo tani waa wax weyn.
There is also some controversy.	Waxa kale oo jira wax kale oo la isku haysto.
He would be a good man to work for.	Waxa uu noqon lahaa nin wanaagsan oo loo shaqeeyo.
I think it is for me.	Waxay ila tahay inay aniga ii tahay.
But that is no longer the case.	Laakiin taasi mar dambe maaha.
But it can't be helped.	Laakiin lama caawin karo.
And more and more.	Iyo in ka badan iyo in ka badan.
I gave you a few.	Dhowr baan ku siiyay.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
he would go.	wuu tagi lahaa.
It was something other than that.	Waxay ahayd wax aan taas ahayn.
But just me.	Laakiin aniga kaliya.
Do not take it back.	Dib ha u qaadan.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
This is usually not a problem.	Tani inta badan dhib maaha.
He will no longer be the same man.	Mar dambe isku nin ma noqon doono.
Everyone would be fine.	Qof walba wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
It was not right.	Ma ahayn wax sax ah.
But that can no longer help.	Laakiin taasi mar dambe lama caawin karo.
I know no one likes him, but still.	Waan ogahay in qofna uusan jeclayn isaga, laakiin weli.
That's what he told us.	Waa sida uu noo sheegay.
There is nothing too great.	Wax aad u weyn ma jiraan.
No one really said anything.	Qofna run ahaantii waxba ma odhan.
I did not know why.	Ma garanayn sababta.
If there is another, please let me know.	Haddii uu mid kale jiro, fadlan ii soo sheeg.
This is just another.	Tani waa mid kale oo kaliya.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
But there is no such thing there.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax la mid ah halkaas.
More than ever.	In ka badan sidii hore.
I am a friend and hard worker.	Waxaan ahay saaxiib iyo shaqo adag.
Nothing goes on	Ma jiraan wax sii socda
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
You can even see that.	Xitaa taas waad arki kartaa.
We are just friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo kaliya.
Like, for a long time.	Sida, muddo dheer.
Maybe he is fine.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu fiican yahay.
Let it work for you.	Ha kuu shaqeeyo.
It should not be a problem for you.	Waa in aanay dhib kugu ahayn.
But they did not succeed.	Laakiin kuma ay guulaysan.
He was always with us.	Mar walba wuu nala joogay.
Not the best, but it will.	Ma ahan tan ugu fiican, laakiin way sameyn doontaa.
In fact, there.	Dhab ahaantii, halkaas.
But there is no real truth.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax dhab ah oo run ah.
Not sure how he would take this.	Ma hubo sida uu tan u qaadan lahaa.
You are right and right.	Waxaad tahay mid sax ah oo sax ah.
He heard everything.	Wax walba wuu maqlay.
Definitely one for you.	Dhab ahaan mid adiga.
One to say.	Mid aan sheego.
I wish they did nothing.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aysan waxba qaban.
For him, there was no such place.	Isaga, meel la mid ah ma jirin.
Not much.	Wax badan maaha.
I was really lucky.	Runtii nasiib ayaan helay.
I refused.	waan diiday.
But he never did.	Laakiin waligiis ma samayn.
But it doesn’t always do.	Laakiin had iyo jeer ma sameyso.
That was a lot of fun for me.	Taasi waxay ii ahayd wax aad u xiiso badan.
Not halfway.	Ma rabin.
No one knows what is in it.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa ku jira.
It was a clear day.	Wuxuu ahaa maalin cad.
I looked, I didn't understand any of them.	Waan eegay, ma fahmin mid ka mid ah.
I really don't want that again.	Dhab ahaantii taas mar kale ma rabo.
This is nothing new.	Tani maaha wax cusub.
Produced without any problems.	La soo baxay dhib la'aan.
I don't know where.	Ma garanayo meel.
He never won.	Waligiis ma guulaysan.
Now he did.	Hadda wuu sameeyay.
She always had to be there.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd inay halkaas joogto.
I can't find anything to do here.	Ma heli karo wax aan ku sameeyo halkan.
Definitely an old one.	Hubaal mid hore.
I wanted it to last and to last and not to end.	Waxaan rabay inay sii jirto oo ay sii jirto oo aanay dhammaan.
He wants to do it alone.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu keligiis sameeyo.
A friend still loves me.	Saaxiib wali wuu i jecel yahay.
This is a very interesting problem.	Tani waa dhibaato aad u xiiso badan.
She told me everything.	Wax walba way ii sheegtay.
This is what.	Tani waa waxa.
Not very good.	Ma ahan mid aad u wanaagsan.
That is why he came.	Waa sababta uu u yimid.
I expect a lot from you.	Wax badan ayaan kaa filayaa.
He never thought of me this.	Waligiis igama uu malayn arrintan.
In fact, he says to me.	Run ahaantii, wuu igu leeyahay.
Certainly not me.	Dhab ahaantii aniga aniga maaha.
I don’t want to be someone else.	Ma rabo inaan noqdo qof kale.
I can't see to help that.	Ma arki karo si aan taas u caawiyo.
But it may be more difficult.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad uga sii adag tahay.
I desperately need it.	Aad ayaan ugu baahanahay.
They did not provide food.	Cunto ma aysan siin.
She did most of it.	Inta badan way samaysay.
It was done for me.	Waa la ii sameeyay.
It was, for a while.	Waxay ahayd, muddo.
But there is a lot here.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo halkan.
What a car.	Waa maxay baabuur.
Better yet.	Inta ka sii wanaagsan tan.
I'm sorry about everything else.	Wax kasta oo kale waan ku xumahay.
No one can harm you now.	Qofna hadda wax kuma yeeli karo.
I didn't find anything.	Waxba maan helin.
They will not.	Ma yeeli doonaan.
In all.	In dhammaan .
I still think he can do it.	Weli waxaan qabaa inuu samayn karo.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga.
Something big happened.	Wax weyn baa dhacay.
They do that, but not only that.	Waxay sameeyaan taas, laakiin maaha oo kaliya.
I have never seen anyone so beautiful.	Waligiis ma arag qof sidaas u qurux badan.
In fact, it probably was.	Runtii, malaha wuu ahaa.
I do not lie.	Been ma sheego.
He has to be fine.	Waa inuu iska fiican yahay.
Do not leave.	Ha ka bixin.
On the way home.	Guriga ku socda.
He had enough.	Waxa uu lahaa ku filan.
Everything is the same.	Wax walba waa isku mid.
If any.	Haddii ay jiraan.
I don't know for sure.	Ma garanayo hubaal.
That is very good.	Taasi waa mid aad u fiican.
I don't want to work.	Ma rabo inaan shaqeeyo.
Nothing, really.	Waxba ma jiro, runtii.
I did not say this.	Ma odhan tan.
Better surprisingly, even.	Si ka fiican la yaab leh, xitaa.
It is you.	Adiga ayaa ah.
Almost everyone loves it.	Inta badan qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay.
Take time	Waqti qaado
There was a lot.	Waxaa jiray wax badan.
A little.	In yar.
Another true one.	Mid kale oo run ah.
He wanted to be nothing.	Wuxuu rabay inuu noqdo waxba.
He was not at home.	Ma uusan joogin guriga.
He is a good person.	Waa qof wanaagsan.
But he did not come.	Laakiin ma iman.
Just thought this was great !.	Kaliya u maleeyay in tani ay fiican tahay!.
More beautiful.	Ka qurux badan.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ka badan tahay.
Now I need a new person.	Hadda waxaan u baahanahay qof cusub.
He didn't know she was here.	Ma uusan ogeyn inay halkaan joogto.
I'm sure of that.	Waan hubaa taas.
A man who is not yet.	Nin aan weli ahayn.
She was constantly busy.	Waxay ahayd mashquul joogto ah.
It would not do	Ma yeeli lahayn
Probably not.	Malaha ma lahayn.
I didn't always know that.	Mar walba taas maan ogeyn.
I'm sure he's fine.	Waan hubaa inuu fiican yahay.
So he told the people.	Sidaas ayuu dadka ku yidhi.
I have no chance.	Fursad ma haysto.
are you right	sax ma tahay.
So, too, she had.	Sidaas, sidoo kale, waxay lahayd.
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan la hadlo.
I have everything I do.	Waxaan hayaa wax walba oo aan sameeyo.
She would say.	Waxay sheegi lahayd.
They could do nothing for him.	Isaga waxba ma ay samayn karin.
This was something else.	Tani waxay ahayd wax kale.
Can you tell me what to do.	Ma ii sheegi kartaa waxaan sameeyo.
There is nothing surprising.	Ma jiraan wax la yaab leh.
Only the worst.	Kaliya kan ugu xun.
She loves you.	Way ku jeceshahay.
He is very popular, he is very smart.	Aad buu loo jecel yahay, aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay.
No one loves me.	Qof i jecel ma jiro.
And, of course, it was.	Oo, dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd.
Now he knew everything.	Hadda wax walba wuu ogaa.
How to do it.	Sida ay yeeli lahayd.
Take it to a friend.	U qaado saaxiib.
He should say and do nothing.	Waa inuu sheego oo waxba ha samayn.
For me, that is a problem.	Aniga, taasi waa dhibaato.
There are none.	Ma jiraan .
What to tell.	Waxa loo sheego.
It is difficult to say here.	Way dhib yar tahay in halkan lagu sheego.
That's the thing, right ?.	Taasi waa wax, sax?.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
I have heard a lot about you.	Wax badan baan kaa maqlay.
You can't help me.	Ima caawin kartid.
It's just fine.	Way fiican tahay oo kaliya.
You can clearly see it here.	Waxaad si cad u arki kartaa halkan.
No one can see me.	Qofna ima arki karo.
He came back.	Dib ayuu ugu soo noqday.
They no longer wanted me.	Mar dambe ima ay rabin.
You shall not come to me.	Waa inaadan ii iman.
I like to talk to.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan la hadlo.
Lots of it out there.	Wax badan oo halkaas ka jira.
This is probably the best.	Tani waxay u badan tahay tan ugu wanaagsan.
This really sounds like me.	Runtii tani waxay u egtahay aniga oo kale.
he would do.	wuu samayn lahaa.
You will return	Waad soo noqon doontaa
It would probably be much better.	Waxay u badan tahay inay aad uga fiicnaan lahayd.
I saw it everywhere.	Meel walba waan ku arkay.
He would go tomorrow.	Berrito wuu tagi lahaa.
And nothing will be done.	Oo waxba la qaban maayo.
I wanted to know everything.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax walba ogaado.
I really don't understand why.	Runtii ma fahmin sababta.
I did not say that.	Taas ma odhan.
He doesn't have to.	Ma aha inuu sameeyo.
They need only one.	Waxay u baahan yihiin hal kaliya.
I have to be in jail.	Waa inaan xabsiga ku jiraa.
There is nothing more beautiful so far.	Ma jiraan wax aad u qurux badan ilaa hadda.
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
They really didn't understand anything.	Runtii waxba ma ay fahmin.
Really good.	Runtii aad u fiican.
They love this.	Way jecel yihiin tan.
I will not let them do it to me.	U ogolaan maayo inay igu sameeyaan.
I wanted to talk to everyone about everything.	Waxaan rabay inaan qof walba kala hadlo wax kasta.
Now you like it.	Hadda waad jeceshahay.
You need to eat well.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad si fiican wax u cunto.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I wish he would come later.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu yimaado mar dambe.
But this was something new.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd wax cusub.
It may be good for money.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ku fiican yahay lacag.
But don't believe it.	Laakiin ha rumaysan.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
No one likes you yet.	Qofna kuma jecla weli.
Really amazing.	Runtii aad u yaab badan.
You may be very happy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u faraxsan.
None of us speak.	Mid naga mid ah ma hadlo.
I would like it if it was true.	Waan jeclaan lahaa haddii uu run ahaan lahaa.
But I think there is a problem.	Laakiin waxaan filayaa inay jirto dhibaato.
You know you would.	Waad ogtahay inaad sameyn lahayd.
As well as several other people.	Sidoo kale dhowr qof oo kale.
But there is more here.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan halkan.
This can be almost one.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid ku dhow hal.
He would say.	Waxa uu odhan lahaa.
There is none.	Ma jirto.
It has to be learned.	Waa in la barto.
He thought he knew what was coming.	Wuxuu mooday inuu garanayo waxa soo socda.
He found me.	Wuu iga helay.
I think it is very interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu aad u xiiso badan yahay.
It was over.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan.
I couldn't see very well	Si fiican uma arki karin
This is untrue.	Tani waa wax aan run ahayn.
It's like leaving home again.	Waxay la mid tahay in mar kale guriga laga tago.
So far nothing good has happened.	Ilaa hadda wax wanaagsan ma jiro.
Everyone wants him.	Qof kastaa wuu rabaa isaga.
I left the room with a younger man, all around.	Waxaan qolka uga baxay nin ka yar, dhan walba.
But something else came along.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa yimid.
I had to leave here.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkan ka baxo.
I love teaching people.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan dadka barto.
As it was.	Sidii uu ahaa.
And beautiful and good.	Oo qurux badan oo wanaagsan.
But something always stopped me.	Laakiin mar walba wax ayaa i joojin jiray.
I can definitely say that now.	Waxaan si hubaal ah u odhan karaa hadda taas.
Mar me.	Mar aniga.
Not much to do.	Wax badan in la sameeyo maaha.
I don't even speak.	Xitaa ma hadlo.
And for sure, that definitely has something to do.	Oo hubaal, taasi hubaal waxay leedahay wax la sameeyo.
For a while it was great.	In muddo ah waxay ahayd mid weyn.
And do you not know.	Oo miyaadan ogayn.
I am not a big man.	Anigu ma ihi nin weyn.
It has been a long time for me as well.	Waxay ii ahayd wakhti dheer sidoo kale.
Don't tell me what to eat.	Wax aan cuno ha ii sheegin.
I can't say what he wants.	Waxa uu rabo ma sheegi karo.
It is not true.	Ma aha mid run ah.
It was a problem.	Dhib buu ahaa.
Beautiful, really.	Qurux badan, dhab ahaantii.
I just felt it.	Kaliya waan dareemay.
That is why they will no longer be friends.	Taasi waa sababta aysan mar dambe saaxiibo u noqon doonin.
He thought it was beautiful.	Wuxuu mooday inay qurux badan tahay.
No man.	Nin ma leh.
He is not a good man.	Nin fiican maaha.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
A few others did.	In yar oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
I have something to do.	wax aan sameeyo ayaan hayaa.
He is a very good friend.	Waa saaxiib aad u wanaagsan.
I was not able to do it.	Ma awoodin inaan sameeyo.
It was a very long time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u dheer.
He knows better than to do that.	Wuu garanayaa si ka fiican inuu taas sameeyo.
Maybe he likes it.	Malaha wuu jecel yahay.
But they are nothing.	Laakiin waxba kuma jiraan.
it was amazing.	yaab bay ahayd .
I don't want to take it.	Ma rabo inaan ka qaado.
That will do.	Taasi waxay sameyn doontaa.
They do.	Way sameeyaan.
Everyone knows this for me.	Qof kastaa wuu iga ogyahay tan aniga.
There is another new one.	Waxaa jira mid kale oo cusub.
For me, there is no urgency.	Aniga ahaan, ma jirto wax degdeg ah.
But it was fast.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
No one had that.	Qofna taas ma haysan.
I like.	Waan jeclahay.
Beautiful place.	Meel qurux badan.
I just don't want to	Kaliya ma rabo
There is nothing else in the room.	Wax kale ma jiro qolka.
Very large.	Aad u weyn.
And all the people.	Iyo dadka oo dhan.
Also, give me time.	Sidoo kale, waqti i sii.
It will be very good for all of us.	Aad bay noo wada fiicnaan doontaa.
Obviously they have no job opportunity.	Waxa cad in aanay fursad shaqo u lahayn.
I got one, friend.	Mid baan helay, saaxiib.
I expect to see more.	Waxaan filayaa inaan wax badan arko.
I appeared from there.	Halkaas ayaan ka soo muuqday.
She didn't have much time.	Ma aysan haysan waqti badan.
Not like that.	Ma aha sida.
No one believed me.	Qofna ima rumaysan.
I will take that for granted.	Waan ku qaadan doonaa taas.
Not a very bad idea.	Maaha fikrad aad u xun.
You should also be happy.	Sidoo kale waa inaad faraxsan tahay.
But they said nothing about what happened.	Laakiin waxba kama ay odhan wixii dhacay.
It cannot be money.	Lacag ma noqon karto.
It's great.	Way weyn tahay.
I didn't, I didn't.	Ma lahaa, ma lahayn.
It was something new.	Waxay ahayd wax cusub.
No idea was seen.	Ma jirin wax fikrad ah oo la arkay.
It would be a little more accurate.	Waxay ahaan lahayd in yar oo sax ah.
It was empty.	Waxay ahayd mid aan waxba haysan.
That was unnecessary.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aan loo baahnayn.
Maybe someone else can help you here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof kale halkan ku caawiyo.
I am the same all the time.	Waxaan ahay isku mid mar walba.
Quick, it wasn’t.	Degdeg, ma ahayn.
Both do the same job.	Labaduba isku shaqo.
There is nothing new here.	Ma jiraan wax cusub halkan.
Do nothing.	Waxba ha samayn.
This may be correct.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid sax ah.
I think it is very much true.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u badan tahay run.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
Maybe he wanted someone else available.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu rabay qof kale oo la heli karo.
And this.	Oo kan.
It can not be.	Ma noqon kartaa.
I am very happy to see what is happening here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan arko waxa halkan ka socda.
This is the present day.	Tani waa maalin la joogo.
Good several times.	Wanaagsan dhowr jeer.
You can't have it, but you can pay for it.	Ma haysan kartid, laakiin waad ku bixin kartaa.
There are several.	Waxaa jira dhowr.
Take it, he said.	Qaado, ayuu yidhi.
The rest.	Inta kale.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
This will take time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
Something happened, friend.	Wax baa dhacay, saaxiib.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
That is not a coincidence.	Taasi wax iska dhacay maaha.
Often not available.	Inta badan lama heli karo.
But it is definitely beautiful.	Laakiin waa hubaal inay qurux badan tahay.
Maybe later.	Malaha mar dambe.
I would love to do that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas sameeyo
They will.	Waxay doonaan .
I can no longer leave him.	Mar dambe kama tagi karo isaga.
I don't want one anymore	Mid dambe ma rabo
I'm sure that's not the case.	Waan hubaa inaysan taasi ahayn.
And he clearly wanted something.	Oo si cad ayuu wax u rabay.
I don't get anything.	Waxba kama helo.
You should.	Waxay ahayd inaad.
He told him not to.	Waxa uu u sheegay in aanu samayn.
Only once.	Kaliya hal mar.
But it will come.	Laakiin way iman doontaa.
But you can't take that.	Laakiin taas ma qaadan kartid.
I wanted to see.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko.
Maybe he shouldn't have.	Malaha ma ahayn inuu haysto.
It has been launched.	Waa la bilaabay.
I think she likes him.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay jeceshahay isaga.
Nothing to see here.	Wax halkan lagu arko ma jiraan.
But there is nothing to do.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax la sameeyo.
I'm sorry.	Waa iga xumahay.
You need to know what is going on.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxa socda.
You are bad for everything else.	Waxaad u xun tahay inta kale oo dhan.
I did it all here for myself.	Dhammaan halkan ayaan ku sameeyay aniga.
There is very little time.	Waqti aad u yar ayaa jira.
I always wanted to go there.	Mar walba waxaan rabay inaan halkaas aado.
I did not say that.	Taas ma odhan.
And not just a little, but a lot.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya in yar, laakiin aad u badan.
To be very smart.	Si aad u caqli badan.
I wanted more than anything.	Waxa aan rabay in ka badan wax kasta.
One to help others.	Mid lagu caawiyo dadka kale.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Waqti aan wax ku sameeyo ma helin.
It was definitely too long.	Hubaal waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer.
That's fine.	Taasi waa fiican tahay.
Don't think they can't.	Ha u malayn in aanay awoodin.
But very few did.	Laakiin aad u yar ayaa sameeyay.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
There is only this.	Waxaa jira tan kaliya.
No one charges you.	Qofna wax lacag ah kama qaado.
I have to.	Waa inaan .
I think there is a lot going on.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay wax badan ka jiraan.
This was not the best way to do it.	Tani ma ahayn sida ugu wanaagsan ee loo sameeyo.
I can't speak for long.	Muddo dheer ma hadli karo.
Excellent job.	Shaqo aad u fiican.
That could not be helped.	Taasi waa la caawin waayay.
She would go to him today.	Maanta way u tagi lahayd isaga.
I openly rejected it.	Si cad ayaan u diiday.
Small things.	Waxyaabo yar yar.
They are really smart.	Runtii aad bay u caqli badan yihiin.
I think it's so good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay sidaas u fiican tahay.
A little faster now and then.	In yar oo degdeg ah hadda iyo ka dib.
I did not know.	Maan garanayn .
But that is not a big deal.	Laakiin taasi wax weyn maaha.
It took time.	Waqti ayuu qaatay.
This has not been seen.	Tan lama arag.
I really don't know anymore.	Runtii mar dambe ma garanayo.
Something happened.	Wax baa dhacay oo .
And everything else.	Iyo wax kasta oo kale.
Not much there, obviously.	Ma badna halkaas, iska cad.
I just couldn’t leave.	Kaliya waan ka tagi waayay.
It looks like I didn't get a real job.	Waxay u egtahay inaanan helin shaqo dhab ah.
I wonder how good this will be.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay tani u fiicnaan doonto.
It wasn’t too long.	Ma ahayn mid aad u dheer.
She was right.	Run bay sheegtay.
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
Just nothing obvious.	Kaliya waxba cad.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
But he can't do it alone.	Laakiin keligiis ma samayn karo.
That is very clear.	Taasi waa mid aad u cad.
They are for the people.	Waxay u yihiin dadka.
Not just me, everyone.	Aniga kaliya maaha, qof walba.
Work, work, work.	Shaqada, shaqada, shaqada.
It can make a lot of money.	Waxay sameyn kartaa lacag badan.
This is not recent.	Tani ma aha dhawaan.
You know you are there.	Waad ogtahay inaad halkaas ku jirto.
They still love it.	Weli way jecel yihiin.
I have nothing.	Waxba ma hayo.
But he is not alone.	Laakiin keligiis maaha.
After a while, someone came to the door again.	Muddo ka dib, qof ayaa mar kale yimid albaabka.
Not really good.	Ma ahan wax wanaagsan runtii.
Can anyone please help with this.	Qofna fadlan ma ka caawin karaa arrintan.
The latter saw it and came out.	Kii dambe ayaa arkay oo soo baxay.
He does not go.	Ma tago.
Not sure what he will do.	Ma hubo waxa uu samayn doono.
Really amazing but still.	Runtii mid la yaab leh laakiin weli.
I would do anything.	Wax kasta waan samayn lahaa.
Both were removed.	Labaduba waa laga qaaday.
I would do anything to help him.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta oo aan isaga ku caawiyo.
Nothing more.	Wax dambe ma jiro.
But maybe now.	Laakiin malaha hadda.
I did a bit.	Waxaan sameeyay xoogaa.
One was the former at home.	Mid ka mid ah wuxuu ahaa kii hore ee guriga.
She was a little excited.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo faraxsan.
He went back.	Dib buu u noqday.
But there was another man as well.	Laakiin waxaa jiray nin kale sidoo kale.
That is probably true.	Taasi waa run malaha.
He will do whatever he pleases.	Wuxuu sameyn doonaa wax kasta oo uu jecel yahay.
It can do this.	Way samayn kartaa tan.
Maybe she will tell us something.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax noo sheegi doonto.
I'll pick it up here.	Waxaan ka soo qaadan doonaa halkan.
He will still make a man.	Weli nin buu samayn doonaa.
I did that.	taas ayaan sameeyay.
Something terrible has happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa hadda dhacay.
I don't know why it would be a problem.	Ma garanayo sababta ay dhibaato u noqon doonto.
That was not the only reason.	Taasi ma ahayn sababta kaliya.
It's an exciting job.	Waa shaqo xiiso leh.
This is something else.	Tani waa wax kale.
But she has.	Laakiin way leedahay.
We need it urgently.	Waxaan u baahanahay si degdeg ah.
He asked why.	Sababta ayuu waydiiyay.
They need it the most.	Waxay ugu baahan yihiin.
It looks like it was done.	Waxay u egtahay in la sameeyay.
It was everyone else.	Waxay ahayd qof kasta oo kale.
I just want to say.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sheego.
It is, it is, it is.	Waa, waa, waa.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal ka hor.
No problem, you can't afford it.	Dhib malaha inaadan iska bixin karin.
Bad for you.	Kugu xun.
I would like to stay.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan iska joogo.
They may not be present either.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidoo kale joogin.
.	.
You can still get better.	Weli waad fiicnaan kartaa.
And you will get a job.	Oo waxaad heli doontaa shaqo.
I'm sorry about everything.	Wax walba waan ka xumahay.
I love you.	Ima jecla.
We need everyone we can.	Waxaan u baahanahay qof kasta oo aan heli karno.
I want to do the same.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sidaas oo kale u sameeyo.
It had a man.	Nin baa lahaa.
You should not have.	Waa inaadan haysan.
Too much.	Aad iyo aad u badan.
You would love to	Waad jeclaan lahayd
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad wanaagsan.
It is better than it was.	Way ka fiican tahay sidii ay ahayd.
Anytime, anywhere.	Waqti kasta, meel kasta.
I hope you find it interesting.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ka heli doonto mid xiiso leh.
It's good, but problematic.	Wuu fiican yahay, laakiin dhibaato.
I did not	maan samayn
Less is more.	In ka yar ayaa ka badan.
I didn't think he really wanted to know.	Uma malaynayn inuu runtii rabo inuu ogaado.
The person.	Qofka .
He thinks you did.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inaad samaysay.
Here he would stop.	Halkan ayuu ku joojin lahaa.
I would catch you	waan ku qaban lahaa
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
I can do anything.	Wax walba waan samayn karaa.
But I will need more.	Laakiin waxaan u baahan doonaa wax badan.
But she had.	Laakiin way lahayd.
He said something.	Wax buu yidhi.
That is even more difficult.	Taasi way ka sii dhib badan tahay.
But even that no one came out.	Laakiin xitaa taasi cidna kama soo bixin.
I split up nicely.	Si fiican ayaan u kala baxay.
This was a huge amount of money.	Tani waxay ahayd lacag aad u weyn.
That's what it is, right ?.	Waa waxa ay tahay, sax?.
I heard you.	Waan ku maqlay.
It didn't take much.	Wax badan kuma qaadan.
Several times.	Dhowr jeer.
I really like him.	Runtii waan jeclahay isaga.
Not with him.	Ma isaga la.
I found a lot here.	Wax badan ayaan halkan ka helay.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
He became nothing.	Waxa uu noqday waxba.
This is urgent	Tani waa degdeg
This is actually a bit complicated.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa xoogaa dhib badan.
We do too.	Waanu sidoo kale.
Everything belongs to something else.	Wax walba wax kale ayaa iska leh.
Something bigger than me.	Wax iga weyn.
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
But, you know, they live.	Laakiin, waad ogtahay, way ku nool yihiin.
What maybe.	Maxaa laga yaabaa.
I did everything.	Wax walba waan sameeyay.
After all we are old friends.	Ka dib oo dhan waxaan nahay saaxiibo hore.
I will never love anyone else.	Weligay qof kale ma jeclaan doono.
It will not be a problem.	Dhib ma ahaan doono.
Not if only here.	Ma jiro haddii kaliya halkan.
Still, nothing big.	Weli, wax weyn ma jiraan.
Maybe no one else knew he was there.	Malaha qof kale ma ogayn inuu halkaas joogo.
Maybe I don't know today.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan maanta garanayn.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax fiican.
Lots of trouble, you know.	Dhibaato badan, waad ogtahay.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
But that will take time and money.	Laakiin taasi waxay qaadan doontaa waqti iyo lacag.
In fact, more is coming.	Dhab ahaantii, wax badan ayaa soo socda.
That would definitely be a bad thing.	Taasi hubaal waxay ahaan lahayd wax xun.
If you do, it will be very difficult.	Haddii aad sameyso, waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
Now everything is done at home.	Hadda wax walba waxaa lagu sameeyaa guriga.
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
It should not be misunderstood.	Waa in aan la fahmin.
You would love him.	Waad jeclaan lahayd isaga.
he decided.	ayuu go'aansaday.
I will be fine now	Waan fiicnaan doonaa hadda
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
I can leave him.	Waan ka tagi karaa isaga.
And it can be anyone.	Oo waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
I did nothing.	Waxba maan qaban.
He said a lot.	Wax badan ayuu sheegay.
I have no intention of doing so.	Wax niyad ah uma hayo inaan sidaas sameeyo.
She said you were not.	Waxay tidhi ma aadan ahayn.
Everything is bad.	Wax walba oo xun.
Probably the latter.	Malaha kan dambe.
I still want him.	Wali waan rabaa isaga.
It really looks beautiful.	Runtii waxay u egtahay mid qurux badan.
He said something else.	Wax kale ayuu yiri.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
It just isn’t done.	Kaliya lama samayn.
It looks amazing.	Waxay u egtahay yaab.
Probably the same.	Malaha waa isku mid.
He was a very smart man.	Nin caqli badan buu ahaa.
yaa.	yaa.
I have never seen anything going on right now.	Weligay ma arag wax hadda socda.
I really want to work with him.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan la shaqeeyo isaga.
That would be me soon.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd aniga mar dhow.
We cannot allow that.	Ma ogolaan karno taas.
Not a few years.	Ma aha dhowr sano.
I have very little idea.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad aad u yar.
I hope they will let me see it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ii ogolaan doonaan inaan arko.
When he arrives he will be in a good place.	Marka uu yimaado waxa uu ahaan doonaa meel wanaagsan.
With him.	Aniga oo leh isaga.
He refused that.	Wuu diiday taas.
You will need it.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa.
I'm sorry, really, really.	Waan ka xumahay, runtii, runtii.
She said a little.	Wax yar bay tidhi.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab .
He is really good.	Runtii wuu fiican yahay.
No one knows where he is now.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu hadda joogo.
She always had something good to say.	Had iyo jeer waxay lahayd wax wanaagsan oo ay ku sheegto.
I will not do that.	Taas ku samayn maayo.
Not everyone did.	Qof walba ma samayn.
We can't do much.	Wax badan ma qaban karno.
I haven't seen you until yesterday.	ilaa shalay kuma arag.
As if heard by us.	Sidii in nala maqlay.
It will probably take a long time.	Waxay u badan tahay inay qaadan doonto waqti dheer.
This is even better.	Tani xitaa way fiican tahay.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
A few things are constant.	Waxyaabo yar ayaa joogto ah.
It is best to keep talking.	Waxa ugu fiican in uu sii hadlo.
I got a job	Waxaan helay shaqo
He has decided enough now.	Wuxuu go'aansaday in ku filan hadda.
This was mostly invisible.	Tani waxay ahayd inta badan mid aan la arki karin.
He asked why.	Sababta ayuu waydiiyay.
I look forward to this later.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in aan tan dambe.
He looks a lot better.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid wax badan ka fiican.
What made you need it.	Maxaa kaa dhigay inaad u baahan tahay.
He asked what he was doing.	Waxa uu waydiiyay waxa uu sameeyo.
You really are.	Runtii waad tahay.
I have a job	waxaan leeyahay shaqo
That may be true.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa run.
I have to see him.	Waa inaan arko isaga.
Shortly afterwards he returned.	In yar ka dib wuu soo noqday.
It is a great truth.	Waa run weyn.
This to him.	Tani isaga.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu rabay inuu ila hadlo.
No one wanted him here.	Qofna ma rabin isaga halkan.
What, he did not say.	Waa maxay, ma uu odhan.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
A tall man came out.	Nin dheer ayaa soo baxay.
Money.	Lacag.
I’m not just talking about me.	Ka hadli maayo oo kaliya aniga.
I hope you have a great day.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad leedahay maalin weyn.
She is happy.	Way faraxsan tahay.
Still was, really.	Wali ahaa, dhab ahaantii.
I am a tough guy.	Waxaan ahay nin adag.
He loves everyone and everything.	Qof walba iyo wax walba wuu jecel yahay.
He lost many friends there.	Wuxuu halkaas ku waayay saaxiibo badan.
We don't do that, but he did.	Taas ma samayno, laakiin wuu sameeyay.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
It is hard for anyone to leave.	Way adag tahay in qofna ka tago.
Everyone loves each other.	Qof kastaa wuu is jecel yahay.
As he told you.	Sida uu kuu sheegay.
I wish you didn't say that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaadan sidaas u hadlin.
It's there, somewhere.	Waa halkaas, meel.
But there was something wrong.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax aan sax ahayn.
Not at home.	Aan guriga ku jirin.
It was not me.	Aniga ma ahayn.
I would stay tomorrow.	Waxaan joogi lahaa berrito.
It was.	Waxay ahayd.
When she is there, she is there.	Marka ay halkaas joogto, waa halkaas.
He knew he couldn't come back.	Wuu ogaa inuusan soo noqon karin.
Now they are friends.	Hadda waa saaxiibo.
But he felt he could do more.	Laakiin wuxuu dareemay inuu wax badan qaban karo.
That he would do so.	In uu sidaas samayn lahaa.
There was nothing to eat.	Wax la cuno ma jirin.
Why is this so difficult ?.	Waa maxay sababta ay tani u tahay mid aad u adag?.
I really have to go home.	Runtii waa inaan aado guriga.
I would get it again	mar kale ayaan heli lahaa
I also think that's a good thing.	Waxaan sidoo kale u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
Too bad.	Dhib badan.
That is something new for us.	Taasi waa wax noo cusub.
And there it is.	Oo waxaa jira.
Let me return to you.	Aan kuu noqdo.
Probably less should be done.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay in la sameeyo wax ka yar.
He felt better.	Waxa uu dareemay fiicnaan.
This is a good opportunity.	Tani waa fursad fiican.
He made that.	Taas ayuu ka dhigay.
He wants to leave.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu baxo.
They said nothing to me.	Waxba ima ay odhan.
You look like I am.	Waxaad u egtahay qof aan ahay.
I have to tell him to leave.	Waa inaan u sheego inuu baxo.
No wonder.	Wax aad ula yaabay ma jiraan.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
Where.	Aaway.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
Probably right.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sax ahayd.
I know you are tough.	Waan ogahay inaad adag tahay.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
Before that, really.	Taas ka hor, dhab ahaantii.
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
He did not come.	Ma uusan iman.
Every surprise belongs to someone.	La yaab kasta qof baa iska leh.
But she is good at that.	Laakiin way ku fiican tahay taas.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I have a lot to say about it.	Waxaan hayaa wax badan oo aan ka sheego.
A little good done.	Wax yar oo wanaagsan oo sameeyay.
.	.
They both do.	Labaduba way sameeyaan.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
In fact, it can do anything with anyone.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay la samayn kartaa wax kasta qof kasta.
The day is too long.	Maalin ayaa aad u badan.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I should not talk to you again.	Waa inaanan dib kula hadlin.
No one was here.	Halkan qofna ma jirin.
And this is this, you know.	Oo tani waa tan, waad ogtahay.
After a while even that disappeared.	Wax yar ka dib xitaa taasi waa la waayay.
It can no longer be done.	Mar dambe lama samayn karo.
Now, not all bad.	Hadda, ma wada xun.
Good day, all !.	Maalin wanaagsan, dhammaan!.
But it is not the only place.	Laakiin maaha meesha kaliya.
We knew it could happen at any time.	Waxaan ogeyn inay dhici karto wakhti kasta.
He still couldn't get it.	Wali wuu heli waayay.
It was a great place to work.	Waxay ahayd meel aad u fiican oo laga shaqeeyo.
I will not pay him.	Anigu ma bixin doono isaga.
Great day.	Maalin aad u weyn.
I asked him to come to me.	Waxaan ka codsaday inuu ii yimaado.
Not very smart.	Aan aad u caqli badan.
I got every chance.	Waxaan helay fursad kasta.
Now that is interesting.	Hadda taasi waa mid xiiso leh.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
He said he was in a bad place.	Meel xun ayuu is yidhi.
Something will come out.	Wax baa soo bixi doona.
Someone would love him very much.	Qof isaga aad u jeclaan lahaa.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay tan.
I want everyone to do it for me.	Waxaan rabaa in qof walba igu sameeyo.
But something similarly bad.	Laakiin wax si la mid ah u xun.
It just has to be done.	Kaliya waa in la sameeyaa.
Do not take any chances	Wax fursad ah ha qaadan
He didn't like it there.	Halkaas kuma uu jeclayn.
He knew it was here.	Wuu ogaa inay halkan tahay meel.
I think it is undesirable.	Waxaan filayaa inaan la rabin.
They are so big.	Aad bay u weyn yihiin.
I found	waan helay
I can do anything.	Wax walba waan samayn karaa.
He should not have done this.	Ma ahayn inuu tan sameeyo.
I just have to be there.	Kaliya waa inaan halkaas joogo.
I will talk to you and tell you everything you want.	Waan kula hadli doonaa oo waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Everyone knew why.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa sababta.
I think he knew that.	Waxaan filayaa inuu taas ogaa.
The way he looked is enough.	Sida uu u eegay ayaa ku filan.
I think so well.	Si fiican ayaan u qabaa.
They will not stop.	Ma joojin doonaan.
Probably too much.	Malaha waa aad u badan.
I have no place.	Meel ma haysto.
He really tried.	Runtii wuu isku dayay.
At first it is always very difficult.	Marka hore had iyo jeer aad bay u adag tahay.
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
It is a beautiful day.	Waa maalin qurux badan.
It would help him, too.	Way caawin lahayd isaga, sidoo kale.
It was something else.	Wax kale ayuu ahaa.
That would be true.	Taasi run bay ahaan lahayd.
Is it real.	Ma dhab baa .
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd .
She said more than once.	Waxay tidhi in ka badan hal mar.
Very beautiful indeed.	Aad u qurux badan runtii.
He always did everything right.	Mar walba wax walba si sax ah ayuu u sameeyay.
It was all very interesting.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
It can help.	Way ku caawin kartaa.
Ah, I didn’t know there was a problem.	Ah, ma ogayn inay dhibaato jirto.
It's something else !.	Waa wax kale!.
Not that someone else did.	Ma aha in qof kale sameeyay.
She refused that.	Way diiday taas.
To do so.	In sidaas la sameeyo.
In fact, it is often the other way around.	Dhab ahaantii, inta badan waa si kale.
He didn't need to see it.	Uma uu baahnayn inuu arko.
I don't want to talk about it again.	Ma rabo in aan mar dambe ka hadlo.
He was not ready.	Diyaar ma ahayn.
We knew we could do this.	Waxaan ogeyn inaan sameyn karno tan.
I make a lot of money.	Waxaan sameeyaa lacag badan.
That is bad.	Taasi waa xun.
No one gave me anything.	Qofna waxba ima siin.
It's hard not to go back.	Way adag tahay inaan la noqon.
But it really wasn’t.	Laakiin runtii ma jirin.
Maybe he wants to leave again.	Malaha wuxuu rabaa in uu mar kale isaga tago.
This is who and what we are.	Tani waa cidda iyo waxa aan nahay.
I love doing it	Waan jeclahay inaan sameeyo
Not much.	Ma badna.
She didn't have time, she didn't want to know.	Ma aysan haysan waqti, ma aysan rabin inay ogaato.
He looks like a good man.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa nin wanaagsan.
Everything is great.	Wax walba waa weyn.
And a big one.	Iyo mid weyn.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
Why is he afraid of me?	Muxuu iga baqayaa.
Now, as now.	Hadda, sida hadda.
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula hadlo.
I will give it.	waan siin doonaa.
That is not a bad thing.	Taasi wax xun maaha.
I want something new, something interesting.	Waxaan rabaa wax cusub, wax xiiso leh.
Not really a bad thing.	Runtii wax xun maaha.
But the living, too.	Laakiin dadka nool, sidoo kale.
I went to him.	waan u tagay.
He said to go.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu aado.
Most were not there.	Inta badan ma joogin halkaas.
That would help.	Taasi way caawin lahayd.
Most of the time I did not succeed.	Inta badan ma aan guulaysan.
And maybe this is true today.	Oo malaha tani waa run maanta.
That would be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u fiican.
It does nothing wrong.	Wax xun ma samayso.
Maybe not	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanan
I don't even want to say.	Xitaa ma rabo inaan sheego.
He left.	Wuu iska baxay.
It looks, well.	Waxay u egtahay, si fiican.
She didn't understand me at all.	Waxba igama ay fahmin.
That was for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd hubaal.
Not everyone will get it right all the time.	Qof kastaa ma heli doono sax mar kasta.
You can do that.	Waad samayn kartaa taas.
They are more like people.	Waxay u badan yihiin sida dadka.
You may also know this now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale ogtahay taas hadda.
I still can't believe anyone wanted it.	Wali ma rumaysan karo in qof uu rabay.
She also had this issue.	Sidoo kale waxay lahayd arrintan.
He was surprised.	Waa la yaabay isaga.
I did not believe.	Maan rumaysan.
This will not allow.	Tani ma ogolaan doonto.
That is very difficult.	Taasi aad bay u adag tahay.
No one was at home.	Guriga qofna ma joogin.
But as you wish.	Laakiin sida aad doonto.
Tom is definitely not.	Tom hubaal maaha.
I don't know how they do it.	Ma garanayo sida ay u sameeyaan.
There was no truth.	Wax run ah ma jirin.
He seems to love you there.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu halkaas ku jecel yahay.
I know everyone.	Waan ogahay qof walba.
Please do not.	Fadlan ha samayn.
I can clearly see.	Si cad ayaan u arki karaa.
And that you were ready.	Iyo in aad diyaar u ahayd.
This is a good day.	Tani waa maalin wanaagsan.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
Maybe I was one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mid ahaa.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
I didn't want anyone to know.	Maan rabin in qofna ogaado.
They are many here.	Way badan yihiin halkan.
And the rest.	Iyo inta kale.
It’s everyone.	Waa qof walba.
But there are none.	Laakiin ma jiraan.
He refused to speak.	Wuu diiday inuu hadlo.
I know you don't really want to do that.	Waan ogahay inaadan runtii doonayn inaad taas samayso.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
I’m excited to work with him, too.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan la shaqeeyo isaga, sidoo kale.
That will take time.	Taasi waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
It is always available.	Had iyo jeer waa la heli karaa.
This can be very bad.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xun.
He really did.	Runtii wuu sameeyay.
It would also take time.	Waxay sidoo kale qaadan lahayd waqti.
He knew something.	Wax buu ogaa.
I need to.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan.
I can't leave.	Ma bixi karo.
Certainly now, that is bad.	Hubaal hadda, taasi waa xun tahay.
I saw him.	Waan arkay isaga.
I am right	Waa ila sax
They will do well in school and at work.	Waxay ku fiicnaan doonaan dugsiga iyo shaqada.
True, it is not.	Run, maaha.
One man could not do it alone.	Hal nin ayaa keligiis qaban waayay.
I have no idea who she was.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo cidda ay ahayd.
I just want her to be here already.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in ay halkan mar hore joogto.
It was made for him.	Isaga ayaa loo sameeyay.
This is well known.	Tani waa la wada ogaa.
Not to mention it is a great job.	Ma aha in la sheego waa shaqo weyn.
I don't like to see it.	Ma jecli inaan arko.
A very tall man.	Nin aad u dheer.
We are for sure.	Waxaan hubaal nahay.
I found how to get it.	Waxaan helay sida loo helo.
It's hard to be sure.	Way adag tahay in la hubo.
It really didn’t take much.	Runtii wax badan ma qaadan.
She told him the truth.	Run bay u sheegtay.
I can get out of here	Waan ka bixi karaa halkan
That is to say.	Taasi waa sheeg.
He is back.	Wuu soo noqday.
There seems to be a problem.	Waxay u egtahay inay dhibaato jirto.
They may not even know it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan xitaa ogeyn.
Sure, he loves something like this.	Hubaal, wuu jecel yahay tan oo kale.
And it was all good, too.	Oo waxay ahayd wax walba oo wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
I do not have.	ma hayo.
He may still be there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli halkaas joogo.
As you wish.	Sida aad rabto.
He did something.	Wax buu sameeyay.
It is not a lie.	Been ma aha.
I'll go there	Waxaan aadi doonaa halkaas
Much more is coming.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa soo socda.
It doesn't look the same.	Wax isku mid ah uma eka.
It will be true.	Waxay noqon doontaa run.
It was not too busy.	Ma ahayn mashquul aad u badan.
She had to.	Waxay ahayd inuu.
Whatever you like, give it a chance.	Wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay, sii fursad.
This is both good and bad.	Tani waa mid wanaagsan oo xun.
I don't feel it	ma dareemayo
You can go anywhere you want here.	Waxaad aadi kartaa meel kasta oo aad rabto halkan.
I am afraid	waxaan ka baqayaa
it was amazing.	yaab bay ahayd.
I still need to learn from it.	Wali waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax ka barto.
I don't know why anyone would be there.	Ma garanayo sababta qof u joogi lahaa halkaas.
I was just surprised by that.	Kaliya taas ayaan la yaabay.
He knows he's happy.	Wuu ogyahay inuu faraxsan yahay.
Only at home.	Kaliya guriga.
It's great.	Waa wax weyn.
And, exactly.	Iyo, si sax ah.
But otherwise really close.	Laakiin haddii kale runtii meel dhow.
He does not want to leave the house.	Ma rabo inuu guriga ka tago.
It was as he did.	Waxay ahayd sidii uu u sameeyay.
Don't do anything about it.	Waxba ha ka samayn.
It was here.	Waxay ahayd halkan.
Right, you said.	Sax, waxaad tidhi.
It was never found.	Waligiis lama helin .
But you will take it.	Laakiin waad qaadan doontaa.
I am here	halkaan ayaan joogaa
It should not take too long.	Waa inaysan qaadan waqti aad u dheer.
I can only do it	Kaliya waan samayn karaa
There is none.	Ma jiro.
I just say.	Kaliya waxaan leeyahay.
That probably is.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay.
Here it is, friend.	Waa kan, saaxiib.
It was hard work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
I do not like.	Ma jecli.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.
He obviously has a lot of money.	Waxa cad in uu haysto lacag badan.
It was too long.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer.
Nothing will really help.	Waxba ma caawin doonto runtii.
There was a time later.	Waxaa jiray waqti ka dib.
I can do this now.	Hadda waan samayn karaa tan.
No one knows him.	Qofna ma garanayo isaga.
Don't stop yet.	Ha joojin weli.
I didn't like that very much.	Aad uma jeclayn taas.
No one said anything at school.	Qofna dugsiga waxba kama odhan.
More than ready.	In ka badan diyaar.
He saw something.	Wax buu arkay.
They did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
But three it was.	Laakiin saddex waxay ahayd.
I just wanted to know what to do.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan ogaado inaad sameyso.
Everything happened yesterday.	Wax kasta oo shalay dhacay.
I didn’t want to do it again.	Ma rabin inaan mar dambe sameeyo.
Good job if you can get it.	Shaqo fiican haddii aad heli karto.
No one believed me.	Qofna ima rumaysan.
Very good indeed.	Aad u fiican runtii.
You will also get a lot of money.	Waxaad sidoo kale ku heli doontaa lacag badan.
That would really do.	Taasi runtii way samayn lahayd.
Too fast.	Si aad u degdeg badan.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
He seems to love you.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu kugu jecel yahay.
That way you can keep it.	Sidaas ayaad ku haysan kartaa.
It was quickly picked up.	Si degdeg ah ayaa loo soo qaaday.
What this is is no one knows.	Waxa tani ay tahay qofna ma garanayo.
She did the same thing to everyone else.	Wax la mid ah waxay ku samaysay qof kasta oo kale.
I know it will not be the same.	Waan ogahay in aanay sidii hore ahaan doonin.
No matter how many.	Si kasta oo ay u badan yihiin.
Certainly not very difficult.	Hubaal ma aha mid aad u adag.
Otherwise, nothing big.	Haddii kale, wax weyn ma jiro.
You can't come here anytime soon.	Halkan kuma iman karto si degdeg ah.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
It was a difficult time for him.	Waxay ahayd wakhti adag isaga.
That was lucky.	Taasi waxay ahayd nasiib.
It's work.	Waa shaqo.
This was very difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan.
It's hard for me to say.	Way igu adag tahay inaan sheego.
He had everything a man wanted.	Waxa uu lahaa wax kasta oo nin doonayo.
All very interesting.	Dhammaan aad u xiiso badan.
He left with a little.	In yar buu la baxay.
He took me for granted.	Qurux buu ii qaaday.
That is good food.	Taasi waa cunto wanaagsan.
I'm sure you can find something similar.	Waxaan hubaa inaad heli karto wax la mid ah.
He would get everything.	Wax walba wuu heli lahaa.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
I really don't know what to tell you.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan kuu sheego.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
It may also be invisible.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu sidoo kale yahay mid aan la arki karin.
And they are very good.	Oo aad bay u fiican yihiin.
That is not very happy.	Taasi maaha mid aad u faraxsan.
It is the least you can do.	Waa waxa ugu yar ee aad sameyn karto.
I can go home	Waxaan aadi karaa guriga
But not otherwise.	Laakiin si kale maaha.
I do not like	Ma jecli
But it is a lie.	Laakiin waa been.
I must have been	waa inaan ahaa
For a while.	In muddo ah.
I'll just take time.	Waxaan kaliya qaadan doonaa waqti.
Not everyone learns.	Qof kastaa ma barto.
And what not.	Iyo waxa aan ahayn.
We were just on time.	Waxaan ahayn kaliya waqti.
The whole school is here.	Dugsiga oo dhan waa halkan.
I think we will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inaan fiicnaan doono.
It will not be stopped.	Lama joojin doono.
All reviewed.	La wada eegay.
I saw him.	waan arkay isaga.
Little has been said.	Wax yar baa la yidhi.
It is always amazing.	Had iyo jeer waa yaab.
I really don’t know what else to do.	Runtii ma garanayo wax kale oo aan sameeyo.
You always think you are doing the right thing.	Had iyo jeer waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad samaynayso wax sax ah.
I thought he loved me.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu i jecel yahay.
There is something here	Wax baa jira halkan
I wanted to tell someone about this.	Waxaan rabay inaan qof u sheego arrintan.
He will do it.	Wuu samayn doonaa.
It's even more amazing.	Way ka sii yaab badan tahay.
It made you nothing.	Waxba wuu kaa dhigay.
Give others what you want.	Sii dadka kale waxaad rabto.
You can't see it here.	Halkan kama arki kartid.
Something to find	Wax la helo
Maybe it will be for a while.	Malaha waxay ahaan doontaa in muddo ah.
Here was an opportunity.	Halkan waxay ahayd fursad.
He pretended to know me.	Wuxuu iska dhigay inuu i garanayo.
No one was present.	Meesha qofna kuma jirin.
Here are some things you can do.	Halkan waxaa ah waxyaabo aad sameyn kartid.
The only one yet.	Ka kaliya ee weli.
I think I will do better here.	Waxaan filayaa inaan halkan ku fiicnaan doono.
I have never succeeded.	Weligay waxba kama guulaysan.
But you are lucky, there.	Laakiin waad nasiib badan tahay, halkaas.
They are like you.	Waxay kula mid yihiin adiga.
He wants to, he even wants to.	Wuu rabaa, xitaa wuu rabaa.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
But he was tough.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa mid adag.
I would do the same.	Waxaan samayn lahaa isla sidaas oo kale.
She would have been very successful.	Aad bay u guulaysan lahayd.
He was the one she was supposed to be with.	Wuxuu ahaa kii la rabay inay la joogto.
After a long time.	Muddo dheer ka dib.
She did it there.	Waxa ay ku samaysay halkaas .
She said this was not like him.	Waxay sheegtay in tani aysan isaga la mid ahayn.
But that is an adult.	Laakiin taasi waa qof weyn.
Not available yet.	Ilaa hadda lama hayo.
It was really hard.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
It didn't take long.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer.
It's so good.	Waa sidaas u wanaagsan.
I looked again.	Mar kale ayaan eegay.
Not what he did.	Ma aha waxa uu sameeyay.
The only thing is.	Waxa kaliya ayaa ah.
It just doesn’t do anything.	Kaliya waxba ma samaynayso.
I'm happy they do.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay sameeyaan.
Don't say anything.	Wax ha odhan.
It was great.	Wax weyn bay ahayd.
Someone looked at it.	Qof baa eegay.
It was a great opportunity.	Waxay ahayd fursad fiican.
Not many, but few.	Ma badna, laakiin dhowr.
Great job if you can get it.	Shaqo aad u fiican haddii aad heli karto.
Please correct one by one	Fadlan mid mid u sax
So does someone else.	Sidaas oo kale qof kale.
I would not give it.	Ma siin lahayn.
There is so much for you.	Wax badan ayaa kuu jira.
She said I can find you.	Waxay tidhi waan ku heli karaa.
I think there is something in it.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax ku jiraan.
It's amazing to be with him.	Waa yaab in isaga la joogo.
But there is nothing else we can do.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax kale oo aan samayn karno.
I know everything here.	Waan ogahay wax walba oo halkan ku jira.
But she likes what he's saying now.	Laakiin way jeceshahay waxa uu hadda yidhi.
really really.	run ahaantii run ahaantii.
He knew he would not do it.	Wuu ogaa in aanu yeeli doonin.
You will get it.	Waad heli doontaa.
He rejected us.	Wuu naga diiday.
That was known.	Taasi waa la ogaa.
I think they are smart.	Waxaan filayaa inay caqli badan yihiin.
I know you don't really have anything for me.	Waan ogahay inaadan runtii waxba ii haysan.
It didn't do much.	Wax badan ma qaban.
It's not time.	Waqti maaha.
I just wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay oo kaliya inaan baxo.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
Now we will take what we can get.	Hadda waxaan qaadan doonaa waxaan heli karno.
There is one who knows you here.	Waxaa jira mid ku yaqaan halkan.
She would always do it.	Had iyo jeer way yeeli lahayd.
But now you can do something about it.	Laakiin hadda wax baad ka qaban kartaa.
I wonder what it could be.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxa ay noqon karto.
I shouldn’t think he did.	Waa inaanan u malayn inuu sameeyo.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
She really did.	Run ahaantii way samaysay.
You can't do that here.	Taas halkan kuma samayn kartid.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
There he first heard me.	Halkaas ayuu markii hore igu maqlay.
I would give it something to be here.	Waxaan siin lahaa wax aan halkan joogo.
I don't see that as a bad thing.	Taas uma arko wax xun.
Not included now.	Kuma jiraan hadda.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
I will do whatever you want me to do.	Waxaan samayn doonaa wax kasta oo aad rabto in aan sameeyo.
There was something else.	Wax kale ayaa jiray.
Maybe he will.	Malaha wuu ka dib.
I want to go too.	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado sidoo kale.
I would like to say.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sheego .
I left a lot.	Wax badan baan ka tagay.
He has something to say to you.	Wax buu ku leeyahay.
Beautiful, he would say.	Qurux, ayuu odhan lahaa.
But, no more.	Laakiin, mar dambe ma jirto.
Maybe there is something else.	Malaha wax kale ayaa jira.
Maybe he has something to say.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu haysto wax uu u sheego.
That doesn't help anyone.	Taasi cidna ma caawiso.
This is not what you want.	Tani ma aha waxa aad rabto.
I was so bad.	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u xun.
But as it looks now, it is not.	Laakiin sida ay hadda u egtahay, ma aha.
She has to stay with us.	Waa inay nala joogto.
He would come home and tell her everything.	Wuu iman jiray guriga oo u sheegi jiray wax walba.
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
It should always work.	Had iyo jeer waa inuu shaqeeyo.
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
There was something else.	Wax kale ayaa jiray .
I have never done anything so bad.	Weligay maan samayn wax xun oo sidaas oo kale ah.
As a real one.	Sida mid dhab ah.
You will see that.	Waad arki doontaa taas.
It really is.	Runtii waa.
He went there.	Halkaas ayuu aaday.
I got everything.	Wax walba waan helay.
Not finding how to do it.	Aan helin sida loo sameeyo.
He was there.	Meesha ayuu joogay.
It couldn’t be better than this.	Way ka fiicnaan weyday tan.
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
But it is a great opportunity.	Laakiin waa fursad weyn.
I know you will love me.	Waan ogahay inaad i jeclaan doonto.
But he may have been involved.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax ku jiray.
I really need to do the same.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan sidaas oo kale sameeyo.
You must be able to do this.	Waa inaad tan samayn kartaa.
He may have done this before.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu tan hore u sameeyay.
I want someone	qof baan rabaa
That is a lie.	Taasi waa been.
I am not food.	Ma ihi cunto.
Good day!.	Maalin wanaagsan!.
But there is not much.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax badan.
I will discuss it here.	Waxaan ka hadli doonaa halkan.
You can be one of us.	Waxaad noqon kartaa mid naga mid ah.
It was not a big deal, he said.	Wax weyn ma ahayn, ayuu yidhi.
That's when he saw it.	Waa markii uu arkay.
But it was really good.	Laakiin runtii waxay ahayd mid fiican.
But that will not come.	Laakiin taasi ma iman doonto.
It is very difficult to do it right.	Aad bay u adag tahay in si sax ah loo sameeyo.
He has not yet been given a chance to speak.	Wali ma siin fursad uu ku hadlo.
We can no longer get that.	Mar dambe ma heli karno taas.
I just love that.	Kaliya waan jeclahay taas.
Don't take people for granted.	Dadka ha u qaadan wax aan waxba ahayn.
He could not go that way.	Wuxuu u bixi waayay sidaas.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
It was known that it would end.	Waa la ogaa inay dhammaan doonto.
She had something to do with it.	Wax bay ku lahayd.
you are the only one.	adiga kaliya ayaa tahay.
I know where he is going.	Waan ogahay meesha uu tago.
I have several others.	Waxaan leeyahay dhowr kale.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
This is a new place.	Tani waa meel cusub.
But no one is there.	Laakiin qofna ma joogo.
More and more.	In ka badan iyo in ka badan.
I was right all the time.	Waxaan ahaa sax mar kasta.
It is always late.	Had iyo jeer waa dambe.
But that is not the worst thing.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ugu xun.
But no one knew.	Laakiin qofna ma ogayn.
They do a lot of things.	Waxay sameeyaan waxyaabo badan.
I looked a little	Wax yar baan eegay
Me another one.	Aniga mid kale.
I think it will be interesting.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay noqon doonto mid xiiso leh.
It can be three.	Waxay noqon kartaa saddex.
Maybe she knew it wouldn't be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ogaatay inuusan ahaan doonin.
He was there now.	Halkaas ayuu hadda joogay.
You might even like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad xitaa jeceshahay.
I can't go back	Ma dhici karto inaan ka noqdo
Just better, better.	Kaliya ka sii fiican, aad u fiican.
I can get that.	Waan heli karaa taas.
I'm happy	waan ku faraxsanahay
I need a job like that.	Waxaan u baahanahay shaqo sidaas oo kale ah.
I just want a new one.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa cusub.
I had a good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican.
That is true.	Taasi waa runtii.
We are everything.	Waxaan nahay wax walba.
This is very complicated.	Tani aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
Not given.	Lama siin.
I think it's a good thing.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay wax fiican.
It is not in a good place.	Meel fiican ma joogo.
We are, really.	Waxaan nahay, runtii.
If you are really good, you will get it !.	Haddii aad runtii fiican tahay, waad heli doontaa!.
That’s how it feels there.	Taasi waa sida laga dareemayo halkaas.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
It was a beautiful job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo qurux badan.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
I have to leave	waa inaan baxo
I think it's a lie.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay been tahay.
Like, always.	Sida, had iyo jeer.
He was in great spirits.	Niyad weyn buu ku jiray.
I don't want it now	Hadda ma rabo
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Everyone loves something new.	Qof kastaa wuxuu jecel yahay wax cusub.
Why would he do that?	Muxuu sidaas u samayn lahaa?.
We will all leave.	Waanu wada bixi doonaa.
I hope you are well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad si fiican u wanaagsan tahay.
It won't do, he thought to himself.	Ma yeeli doonto, ayuu is yidhi.
I liked everyone.	Dadka oo dhan waan ka helay.
Money was everything to him.	Lacag ayaa isaga wax walba u ahayd.
He did not speak much.	In badan ma uusan hadlin.
Not sure where to leave here.	Ma hubo meesha aan ka tago halkan.
It looks so much better.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad uga fiican.
I know that's not true.	Waan ogahay taasi run maaha.
I didn't get much else.	Wax badan oo kale ma helin.
Something else is going on.	Wax kale ayaa socda.
No one liked it.	Qofna ma jeclayn.
That was one problem.	Taasi waxay ahayd hal dhibaato.
He should have known she desperately needed him.	Waa inuu ogaa inay si ba'an ugu baahan tahay.
A little more, not much.	Wax yar oo kale, ma badna.
You made a promise.	Ballan baad samaysay.
No one wants it.	Qofna ma rabo.
.	.
I heard him.	Waan maqlay isaga.
I know it will.	Waan ogahay inay yeeli doonto.
Now tell me what happened.	Hadda ii sheeg waxa dhacay.
It's too bad.	Aad buu u xun yahay.
But today it was a problem.	Laakiin maanta waxay ahayd dhib.
It was a very good car.	Waxay ahayd baabuur aad u wanaagsan.
I really have no idea.	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
A little longer.	In yar oo dheer.
Maybe she already had.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hore u lahayd.
Although not really for me.	In kasta oo uusan runtii aniga igu ahayn.
Now he is back again.	Hadda wuu soo noqday mar kale.
But it is so.	Laakiin waa sidaas oo kale.
He was, in a good place.	Wuu joogay, meel wanaagsan.
Busy, you know.	Mashquul, waad ogtahay.
Everyone saw you.	Qof kastaa wuu ku arkay.
I am nothing.	waxba ma ihi.
He would not go any further.	In ka badan ma uu aadi lahaa.
Each of this.	Mid kasta oo tan ka mid ah.
They did not have it.	Ma ay haysan.
I still thought it was you.	Weli waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga.
He would say something.	Wax buu ku odhan lahaa.
I can't say.	Ma awoodo inaan sheego.
This she refused to do.	Tani way diiday inay samayso.
It looks like a problem.	Waxay u egtahay dhibaato.
I am like that.	Waxaan ahay sidaas oo kale.
Maybe some food.	Malaha xoogaa cunto ah.
He came.	Wuu yimid.
That could be better.	Taasi way fiicnaan kartaa.
Sorry, you can't find this one.	Waan ka xumahay, ma heli kartid kan.
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
Day, day.	Maalin, maalin.
If one has more, the other has less.	Haddii mid ka badan haysto, mid kale ayaa yar.
I didn't want anything to be done about it.	Ma rabin in wax lagu sameeyo.
He gave nothing.	Waxba ma uu siin.
I don't think it will happen.	Uma maleynayo inay dhici doonto.
First, that is.	Marka hore, taasi waa.
I told him so.	sidaas baan u sheegay.
I hope that is true.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in taasi run tahay.
But if you don’t, it’s not a big deal.	Laakiin haddii aadan samayn, wax weyn maaha.
That was something new.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax cusub.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan.
But they will not do that.	Laakiin taasi ma yeeli doonaan.
And maybe it is.	Oo laga yaabo inay tahay.
You will help me.	Waad i caawin doontaa.
She said.	Waxay tidhi .
Got it again.	Mar kale helay.
I want to know how long there is still time.	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado inta ay weli waqti jirto.
I didn't always like him.	Mar walba maan jeclayn isaga.
You know it is.	Waad ogtahay inay tahay.
He did not go.	Ma uu tagi jirin.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax walba iga ogaado.
You'll see again, for sure.	Mar kale ayaad arki doontaa, hubaal.
Someone must have seen it before.	Qof waa inuu hore u arkay.
It will also not take any money.	Sidoo kale wax lacag ah ma qaadan doonto.
Maybe no one is there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan qofna halkaas joogin.
She realized they couldn't stay there for long.	Way ogaatay in aanay halkaas joogi karin wakhti dheer.
That’s a good thing, too.	Taasi waa wax fiican, sidoo kale.
He holds it in place.	Meesha ayuu hayaa.
He is definitely gone.	Hubaal wuu baxay.
I did not return.	Kuma soo noqon.
Now I see.	Hadda aan arko.
It was meal time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti cunto.
Maybe it's so good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas u fiican tahay.
It would be nice for him to leave.	Way fiicnaan lahayd inuu ka baxo.
That is what you promised.	Taasi waa waxa aad ballan qaaday.
I don't want it again	Mar kale ma rabo
But you do not have to do that.	Laakiin uma baahnid inaad taas samayso.
I will come	waan iman doonaa
For a while, that is.	In muddo ah, taasi waa.
She had nothing, she had nothing.	Waxba ma haysan, waxba ma ay haysan.
I was everyone.	Waxaan ahaa qof walba.
Now I got a new one.	Hadda waxaan helay mid cusub.
I would do everything right.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta oo sax ah.
I couldn't believe he was a man.	Waxaan u qaadan waayay inuu yahay nin.
Not only that.	Kaliya sidaas maaha.
I will take it	waan qaadan doonaa
But that was the only thing she could do.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee ay sameyn karto.
I hope someone can help me here.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof iga caawin karo halkan.
Good one.	Mid wanaagsan.
He is not an adult.	Ma aha qof weyn.
And there is nothing better to do.	Oo ma jiraan wax ka wanaagsan in la sameeyo.
You can take it.	Waad qaadan kartaa.
He can say what he wants.	Waxa uu rabo wuu sheegi karaa.
But it will be soon.	Laakiin dhawaan ayuu noqon doonaa.
Not sure about that now.	Ma hubo taas hadda.
They are very small.	Aad bay u yar yihiin.
I think that is not a bad idea.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aysan ahayn fikrad xun.
I have a few of them.	Waxaan leeyahay dhowr ka mid ah.
But it is always the same.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waa isku mid.
I want to know something about him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax ka ogaado isaga.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
It is one of them.	Waxay ka mid tahay.
Why didn't that happen.	Maxay taasi u dhici wayday.
She was smart.	Waxay ahayd caqli badan.
I need you to stay here.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkan ku sii jirto.
The latter is more likely.	Tan dambe waxay u badan tahay.
I know it is not, really.	Waan ogahay inuusan ahayn, runtii.
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
That's right.	Waa sax.
Only the best.	Kaliya ugu fiican.
Still, it took time.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, waqti ayuu qaatay.
Everything.	Wax kasta.
Whether this is true is not certain.	In tani sax tahay lama hubo.
I have no idea many things.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysto waxyaabo badan.
Also, there is no payment.	Sidoo kale, ma jirto wax lacag bixin ah.
But nothing was right.	Laakiin ma jirin wax sax ah.
They will help.	Way caawin doonaan.
Where they are not the same.	Halka aanay isku mid ahayn.
Everything that could be found was not here.	Wax kasta oo la heli lahaa halkan kuma jirin.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax yaab leh.
Bad, bad, very bad.	Xun, xun, aad u xun.
They did not.	Ma ay samayn.
That doesn't seem right	Taasi sax uma eka
There is no hard place.	Ma jiro meel adag.
Maybe it is.	Malaha waa.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
How can this be done.	Sidee taas loo samayn karaa.
He had a lot to say.	Wuxuu lahaa wax badan oo uu rabay inuu sheego.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I hope this will get you better.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay si fiican kuu heli doonto.
All I need is.	Waxa kaliya ee aan u baahanahay.
I'll talk about it tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
That really is the least you can do.	Taasi dhab ahaantii waa waxa ugu yar ee aad sameyn kartid.
It's true, really.	Waa run, runtii.
He was not just a good man.	Kaliya ma ahayn nin wanaagsan.
I looked at him carefully.	Si fiican ayaan isaga eegay.
I have a lot going on.	Wax badan baa iga socda.
I think they are not.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaysan ahayn.
No one understood why he did not like it.	Qofna ma fahmin sababta uusan u jeclayn.
It will always tell you what to do.	Had iyo jeer waxay kuu sheegi doontaa waxaad samaynayso.
I'm sure it does.	Waan hubaa inuu jiro.
I have to have a problem.	Waa inaan dhibaato i qabaa.
Come and go.	Yimid oo aaday.
Wow it is.	Waa waa waa.
It will happen, too.	Way dhici doontaa, sidoo kale.
I picked up three more.	Saddex kale ayaan soo qaatay.
That is what it was.	Taasi waa waxa ay ahayd.
Both will give you a lot of money.	Labaduba waxay ku siin doonaan lacag aad u badan.
That's how it feels to me.	Waa sida ay aniga ila tahay.
He said a man came to him.	Wuxuu yidhi nin baa u yimid.
Maybe he should do it now.	Laga yaabaa inuu hadda sameeyo.
No one wants this.	Qofna uma rabo tan.
No one should ever know.	Qofna waa inuu waligiis ogaado.
I found this very interesting.	Waxaan taas ka helay mid aad u xiiso badan.
He had seen something like this before.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ayuu hore u arkay.
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
I really should have known.	Runtii waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
That is work.	Taasi waa shaqo.
That is a bad thing.	Taasi waa wax xun.
He is here to help	Wuxuu halkan u joogaa inuu caawiyo
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
It is always new.	Had iyo jeer waa cusub.
It really is one of the hardest work.	Dhab ahaantii waa mid ka mid ah shaqada ugu adag.
I will never say.	Weligay ma sheegi doono.
Amazing man.	Nin yaab leh.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
He looked out the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka eegay.
It was no small feat.	Wax yar ma ahayn.
Unknown.	Lama yaqaan.
Just a little bit.	Kaliya wax yar.
But they do not.	Laakiin ma sameeyaan.
Not true	Run maaha
I saw him.	waan arkay isaga.
He did not do enough.	Wax ku filan ayuu qaban waayay.
It's really weird, you know.	Runtii waa wax la yaab leh, waad ogtahay.
No matter how good you were as a friend.	Dhib ma lahayn sida wanaagsan ee aad saaxiib u ahayd.
She should know why he did what he did.	Waa inay ogaato sababta uu u sameeyay waxa uu sameeyay.
You are very happy.	Aad baad u faraxsan tahay.
It has been clear for a while.	Waxay ahayd mid cad in muddo ah.
I still think it's a bad idea.	Weli waxaan qabaa inay fikrad xun tahay.
It will always be interesting.	Had iyo jeer waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
I knew it would come.	Waan ogaa in ay iman doonto.
Very beautiful just for me.	Aad u qurux badan oo kaliya aniga.
I'm sure it will happen.	Waan hubaa inay dhici doonto.
I really love you, you know.	Runtii waan ku jeclahay, waad ogtahay.
There are several others who know.	Waxaa jira dhowr kale oo yaqaan.
It really is.	Dhab ahaantii waa.
This is true for everyone now.	Tani run bay u tahay qof walba hadda.
there! 	halkaas!
If you do not like it, very bad.	Haddii aadan ka helin, aad u xun.
This would be nice to see.	Tani waxay fiicnaan lahayd in la arko.
It was nothing.	Waxay ahayd wax aan ahayn.
Most of the time, he was not at home.	Inta badan, guriga ma joogin.
I think it was just one.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd mid kaliya.
But that was a problem the other day.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd dhibaato maalin kale.
You must be seen.	Waa in lagu arko.
There were a few times that were really hard.	Waxaa jiray dhowr jeer oo runtii aad u adag.
I was one of them.	Mid baan ku ahaa.
I hope they don't.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan yeeli doonin.
No one can do this.	Qofna ma samayn karo tan.
That will also be interesting.	Taasi sidoo kale waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
She could be a school friend.	Waxay noqon kartaa saaxiib dugsiga.
But you know that.	Laakiin taas waad ogtahay.
They are real things.	Waa waxyaabo dhab ah.
Everything for everyone.	Wax walba qof walba.
Stop now.	Jooji hadda.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
That's how he saw me.	Sidaas ayuu ii arkay.
He looks like a good man.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa nin wanaagsan.
I can't believe he will do that again.	Ma rumaysan karo inuu taas mar kale samayn doono.
We will see more of him.	Wax badan ayaan arki doonaa isaga.
It is not too hard to know.	Ma aha inay aad u adag tahay in la ogaado.
I would love to see more of him.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko wax badan oo isaga ah.
It can be very demanding.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u baahan.
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
But so far it looks good.	Laakiin ilaa hadda wuu u muuqdaa mid wanaagsan.
But you know what.	Laakiin waad ogtahay waxa.
Not even now.	Xitaa hadda ma jirto.
What a tough guy.	Maxaa nin adag.
Not knowing.	Aan ogayn.
But he did not come.	Laakiin ma iman.
And there is enough time.	Oo waxaa jira waqti ku filan.
You will see.	Waad arki doontaa.
They are tough and tough.	Way adag yihiin oo adag yihiin.
He is a very interesting man.	Waa nin xiiso badan.
But if you can't do it, and you can't come.	Laakiin haddii aadan samayn karin, oo aadan iman karin.
I really would be.	Runtii waan ahaan lahaa.
I need to see him immediately.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan si degdeg ah u arko isaga.
It wasn’t fun.	Ma ahayn mid xiiso leh.
Any lie they like.	Been kasta oo ay jecel yihiin.
I want to know who knew.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado cidda ogaa.
Everything is in place.	Wax walba waa meesha.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
Is this done there? 	Tan ma halkaas baa lagu sameeyay?
Definitely better than one.	Hubaal mid ka wanaagsan mid ka mid ah.
For a while, even this did not help.	In muddo ah, xitaa tani ma caawin.
Not a big deal.	Dhib weyn maaha.
There may be more than now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax ka badan hadda.
Surprisingly, it has not been done yet.	Waxa la yaab leh, ilaa hadda lama samayn.
Now, he wanted nothing.	Hadda, wuxuu rabay waxba.
There are many things in common.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo isku mid ah.
Something new has emerged.	Wax cusub ayaa soo baxay.
I wouldn't do it now.	Hadda ma samayn lahaa.
That he really is not.	In uu si dhab ah u ahayn.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
.	.
Now there is this, and this, and this and more.	Hadda waxaa jira kan, iyo kan, iyo kan iyo ka badan.
It looks very small.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u yar.
Bad idea.	Fikrad xun.
No wonder I can't.	Yaab ma awoodo.
A little.	Wax yar.
I really know him.	Runtii waan garanayaa isaga.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
You know, me.	Waad ogtahay, aniga.
You need it now.	Waxaad u baahan tahay hadda.
Everything else is still very difficult.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa weli ah mid aad u adag.
I can do something about it	Waan wax ka qaban karaa
I have to get everything right.	Waa inaan wax walba si sax ah u helo.
I love you	waan ku jeclahay
They live every day.	Waxay ku nool yihiin maalin kasta.
A little bit.	Wax yar ayaa yar.
He wanted to know who she was.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado cidda ay tahay.
Someone is sure to see us.	Qof ayaa hubaal ah inuu na arki doono.
The biggest was a good place.	Kan ugu weyn wuxuu ahaa meel wanaagsan.
Maybe I am too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan sidoo kale ahay.
Something good will come.	Wax wanaagsan ayaa iman doona.
It would happen.	Way dhici lahayd.
I can't.	Anigu ma awoodo.
Everything is amazing.	Wax walba waa yaab.
Nothing less sure will do.	Wax hubaal ah oo ka yar ma samayn doono.
He was very smart.	Caqli badan buu ahaa.
That I am not sure.	Taasi aniga ma hubo.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
Just take this.	Kaliya qaado kan.
He was sure he was there for me.	Waxa uu hubaa in uu aniga ii joogay.
He knew he was in trouble.	Wuu ogaa inuu dhib ku jiro.
As you would like.	Sida aad jeclaan lahayd.
He had to come out.	Waxay ahayd inuu ka soo baxo.
I know why.	Waan garanayaa sababta.
It has to be done today.	Waa in maanta la sameeyaa.
I will take it	waan qaadan doonaa
This may not be obvious.	Tani ma noqon karto mid cad.
He got it back.	Dib ayuu u helay.
He still didn't have it.	Weli ma uusan haysan.
Again and again.	Mar iyo mar kale.
He didn't want to talk much.	Ma uu rabin inuu wax badan hadlo.
Maybe it would be next.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu noqon lahaa mid soo socda.
I got a job	Waxaan helay shaqo
I came back.	Dib baan u soo noqday.
I don't want anyone to speak ill of me.	Ma rabo in qof si xun iga hadlo.
This is a lot of money.	Tani waa lacag aad u badan.
You don't have to be better than someone.	Maaha in aad qof ka wanaagsan tahay.
You know that is a good idea.	Waad ogtahay in taasi ay tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
There is so much more going on here.	Waxaa jira si ka badan oo ka socda halkan.
I need to eat	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan cuno
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
But it may not be so.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan sidoo kale noqon.
Maybe I should.	Malaha waa inaan.
Do not leave the room.	Ha ka bixin qolka.
Just not sure what it is.	Kaliya ma hubo waxa ay tahay.
Give what you will do.	Sii waxaad samayn doonto.
This was fun to do.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh in la sameeyo.
Certainly not.	Runtii sidaas maaha.
I just looked.	Kaliya waan eegay.
John don't take anything.	John waxba ha qaadan.
And there are other things as well.	Oo waxaa jira waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
You are a good friend !.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib wanaagsan!.
Now it would help me.	Hadda way i caawin lahayd.
But here no one was there.	Laakiin halkan cidna wuu u jiray.
She told him.	Way u sheegtay.
I'm afraid I can't tell you much.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan wax badan kuu sheegi karin.
It is even better to be taken every day !.	Xitaa way ku fiican tahay in lagu qaado maalin kasta!.
You are a good person.	Qof wanaagsan baad tahay.
I can see that now.	Taas hadda waan arki karaa.
That was a problem.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhibaato.
Obviously there was a lot.	Si cad wax badan ayaa u jiray.
I need a car	Waxaan u baahanahay baabuur
There was something wrong.	Wax baa ka jiray .
But it is not a lie.	Laakiin been maaha.
Now don't say anything.	Hadda waxba ha odhan.
It cannot be true.	Run ma noqon karto.
Each of us thought they were great.	Qof kasta oo naga mid ah wuxuu mooday inay weyn yihiin.
I really can't believe this.	Runtii tan ma rumaysan karo.
Here, there are none.	Halkan, ma jiraan.
Not sure how.	Ma hubo sida.
I'll tell you what it was for me.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxay igu ahayd.
Everything is ready.	Wax walba waa diyaar.
I think he is very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu aad u fiican yahay.
No one will give it to you.	Qofna ku siin maayo.
I think that was right.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi sax ahayd.
He is very smart.	Aad buu u caqli badan yahay.
Obviously, something similar.	Sida iska cad, wax la mid ah.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
If done correctly, it can take a lot of time.	Haddii si sax ah loo sameeyo, waxay qaadan kartaa waqti aad u badan.
And tell them.	Oo u sheeg.
And none of us got it.	Oo mid naga mid ah ma uu helin.
What you said is not quoted.	Wax aad sheegtay lama soo qaado.
It was, after all, why he would come.	Waxay ahayd, ka dib oo dhan, sababta uu u iman lahaa.
Once three.	Hal mar saddex.
I don't work that way	Anigu sidaas uma shaqeeyo
Not much.	Ma badna.
I want you to know something.	Waxaan rabaa inaad wax ogaato.
Everything she said is true.	Wax kasta oo ay tidhi waa sax.
He fell behind.	Dib buu u dhacay.
What to do ?.	Maxaa la sameeyaa?.
That's right for me.	Waa sax aniga ahaan.
I wish I hadn’t been stopped.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan la iga joojin.
That is a lie.	Taasi waa been.
I didn't like him a little.	In yar maan ka helin isaga.
He said.	Wuu yidhi.
He is very smart	Waa caqli badan
I couldn't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karin.
I was surprised.	Waan la yaabay.
He is not here now.	Hadda ma joogo halkan.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I didn’t have much time.	Ma aanan haysan waqti aad u badan.
You can't do anything.	Waxba kuma samayn karto.
Not spoken.	Lama hadlin.
It wasn't much.	Wax badan ma ahayn.
You will be with us.	Waad nala joogi doontaa .
This is the best place.	Tani waa meesha ugu fiican.
You can only give.	Waxaad ku siin kartaa oo kaliya.
They did not receive any money.	Wax lacag ah ma ay helin.
I know he's in trouble.	Waan ogahay inuu dhib ku jiro.
It's beautiful, really.	Way qurux badan tahay, runtii.
He loves it so much.	Aad ayuu u jecel yahay.
I should have told you first.	Waxay ahayd inaan marka hore kuu sheego.
That doesn't seem right.	Taasi sax uma eka.
They may not want someone else to go, someone else to come.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan rabin in qof kale tago, qof kale yimaado.
She did so here.	Waxay sidaas ku samaysay halkan.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
I really do.	Runtii runtii waan sameeyaa.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
I can't see.	Ma arki karo.
Everything is money.	Wax walba waa lacag.
It is very difficult for everyone.	Aad bay ugu adag tahay qof kasta.
It was a good problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato fiican.
All he wanted was money.	Waxa kaliya ee uu rabay waxay ahayd lacag.
I will love you	waan ku jeclaan doonaa
Good food.	Cunto fiican.
It was done.	Waxa la sameeyay.
They are, really.	Waxay yihiin, runtii.
That is not beautiful.	Taasi ma qurux badna.
For you and me, it can still happen.	Aniga iyo adiga, wali way dhici kartaa.
Not sure how to do that.	Ma hubo sida loo sameeyo taas.
Maybe he knows something.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax garanayo.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
You and him.	Adiga iyo isaga.
It takes time.	Waxay u baahan tahay waqti.
I didn't really get anything.	Wax dhab ah maan helin.
I told him a lot.	Wax badan ayaan u sheegay.
Stop once	Hal mar jooji
Now done here.	Hadda halkan lagu sameeyay.
It is non-existent.	Waa mid aan waxba ka jirin.
This is not a problem.	Tani dhib ma aha.
He did not go.	Ma uusan tagin.
He does not want to be known, he said.	Ma rabto in lagu ogaado, ayuu yidhi.
I think this is true.	Waxaan filayaa inay tani run tahay.
A lot.	Wax badan .
He has always been here.	Waligiis halkan buu joogi jiray.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
That can't be.	Taas kuma noqon karo.
It is not available	Lama hayo
It is said that I know you.	Waxa la yidhi waan ku garanayaa.
Everyone started to pick it up.	Qof kastaa wuxuu bilaabay inuu qaado.
But that's not how he thinks.	Laakiin taasi maaha sida uu u malaynayo.
But we do not.	Laakiin ma samayno.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
It has always been true.	Mar walba run bay ahayd.
Otherwise, it is not.	Haddii kale, ma aha.
That has a lot.	Taasi waxay leedahay wax badan.
I will go ahead.	Waxaan aadi doonaa hore.
There was nothing else we could do.	Wax kale oo aanu samayno ma jirin.
He said it was not.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay ahayn.
He just didn't have much to say.	Kaliya wax badan oo uu sheego ma lahayn.
That is what you have to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
This was to be done now.	Tani waxay ahayd in la sameeyo hadda.
Just don't tell them everything.	Kaliya wax walba ha u sheegin.
In fact, they love it.	Dhab ahaantii, way jecel yihiin.
And you don't have to.	Oo uma baahnid.
Now nothing.	Hadda waxba ma jiraan.
He looked at Bay.	Bay ayuu eegay.
There must be something in me.	Waa inay wax igu jiraan.
I think that's very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aad u fiican tahay.
It can stop people from doing what they should be doing.	Waxay ka joojin kartaa dadka inay sameeyaan wax ay tahay inay sameeyaan.
Don't take anything for granted.	Waxba ha u qaadan.
It would always be, always will be.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahaan lahayd, had iyo jeer ahaan lahayd.
She said I can't tell.	Waxay tidhi ma sheegi karo.
Tell them why you like it.	U sheeg sababta aad u jeceshahay.
It’s not just what I am.	Kaliya maaha wax aan ahay.
That is what we need.	Taasi waa waxa aan u baahanahay.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
It is true now.	Waa run hadda.
Ah, there’s a bit of luck again.	Ah, waxaa jira xoogaa nasiib ah mar kale.
But she did, you did.	Laakiin way samaysay, waad samaysay.
It will be the job.	Waxa uu noqon doonaa shaqada.
She will stay here.	Way joogi doontaa halkan.
I do not know exactly.	Si sax ah uma garanayo.
Maybe I should do that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan sidaas sameeyo.
I know this is new to me.	Waan ogahay in tani ay aniga igu cusub tahay.
This was very difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
I am smaller than this.	Aniga ayaa ka yar kan.
They are included.	Waxay ku jiraan.
You can get better.	Waxaad heli kartaa wax ka fiican.
I never thought it would happen.	Waligiis ma malaynayn inay dhici karto.
That's how she said it.	Taasi waa sida ay sheegtay.
Not really sure how to do this.	Runtii ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
Please, please stop	Fadlan, fadlan jooji
But they are alive.	Laakiin waa nool yihiin.
All of this is very interesting.	Dhammaan tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I will not see you again.	Mar dambe ku arki maayo.
When done.	Markii la sameeyay.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
Still, he had to be there.	Weli, waxay ahayd inuu halkaas joogo.
So, he went out.	Sidaas oo kale, wuu baxay.
I can never get that.	Waligiis ma heli karo taas.
He does not want to go home.	Ma rabo inuu guriga aado.
You can't do it	Ma samayn kartid
Just a little trouble.	Kaliya dhib yar.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
It will do amazing things, for sure.	Waxay samayn doontaa wax la yaab leh, hubaal.
It will not hurt.	Wax dhib ah ma yeeli doono.
But he was also a little surprised.	Laakiin sidoo kale wuxuu ahaa mid yar oo yaab leh.
Yesterday, he did it right.	Shalay, si sax ah ayuu sameeyay.
Take it with you.	Adiga qaado.
This is something really new.	Tani waa wax runtii cusub.
I would come back later.	Mar dambe ayaan u soo noqon lahaa.
I don't see how that can happen.	Ma arko sida taasi u dhici karto.
This is great.	Tani waa mid aad u fiican.
That may not be right.	Taasi sax ma noqon karto.
He thought he would leave.	Wuxuu mooday inuu ka bixi doono.
No one is present.	Qofna ma joogo.
He is very happy to do it.	Aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay inuu sameeyo.
made for you	kuu sameeyay
Everyone can see us.	Qof kasta wuu na arki karaa.
Mostly, of course.	Inta badan, dhab ahaantii.
Don't let it.	Ha u ogolaan.
He really didn't believe he would do it.	Runtii wuu rumaysan waayay inuu samayn doono.
You do not need another.	Uma baahnid mid kale.
Can you see? 	Ma arki kartaa?
But you have not done so yet.	Laakiin weli ma aadan samayn sidaas.
It was the same with me.	Isku mid bay ila ahayd.
He is at home with you.	Guriga ayuu kula joogaa.
It was a lot of work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo badan.
He can't stay.	Ma uu joogi karo.
I need to talk to someone.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan qof kala hadlo.
It can't be him.	Ma noqon karto isaga.
You can do whatever you want.	Waxaad ku samayn kartaa waxaad rabto.
He was there.	Halkaas ayuu joogay.
Let me tell you.	Aan kuu sheego.
He thought he was fine.	Wuxuu mooday inuu fiican yahay.
But that is probably why.	Laakiin taasi malaha waa sababta.
But it was very small.	Laakiin waxa ay ahayd mid aad u yar.
Maybe I can work tonight	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan shaqeeyo caawa
That is a small thing, but you have to do it too.	Taasi waa wax yar, laakiin waa inaad sidoo kale sameyso.
It doesn’t have to be much better.	Ma aha in ay wax badan ka fiican tahay.
I felt confident.	Waxaan dareemay inaan isku hubo.
It was white.	Waxay ahayd cad cad.
You may say what you like.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sheegto waxaad jeceshahay .
I don't want that anymore.	Mar dambe sidaas ma rabo.
I didn't think so.	Uma malaynayn.
Both are old.	Labaduba waa hore.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
This is awful.	Tani waa mid aad u xun.
Everything you do is probably good.	Wax kasta oo aad sameyso waxay u badan tahay inay fiican tahay.
For me, he was.	Aniga, wuxuu ahaa.
Maybe he was.	Malaha wuu ahaa.
Please do not say anything to others.	Fadlan dadka kale waxba ha u odhan.
You know, for a long time.	Waad ogtahay, muddo dheer.
Excellent food.	Cunto aad u fiican.
I don't know what to tell you.	Ma garanayo waxaan kuu sheego.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
That was a good time.	Taasi waxay ahayd waqti fiican.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
Will I do it again ?.	Mar kale ma sameyn doonaa?.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
This is new.	Tani waa mid cusub.
I should not have done that.	Ma ahayn inaan taas sameeyo.
Surprised when this was taken.	Yaab markii tan la qaatay.
This is very complicated.	Tani waa mid aad u dhib badan.
I always came back.	Mar walba waan soo noqday.
She lied to others.	Waxay dadka ka been sheegtay dadka kale.
It was urgent.	Waxay ahayd degdeg.
Do you really think there.	Runtii ma waxaad u malaynaysaa halkaas.
But everyone else is.	Laakiin qof kasta oo kale waa.
I know you have to do this.	Waan ogahay inay tahay inaad tan sameyso.
Another, and another, and another.	Mid kale, iyo mid kale, iyo mid kale.
There was nothing.	Waxba ma jirin.
Everyone is happy with someone else.	Qof kastaa wuu ku faraxsan yahay qof kale.
That is not always a good thing.	Taasi had iyo jeer maaha wax wanaagsan.
It was also very busy.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd mid mashquul badan.
I think that could happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhici karto.
But no one came out.	Laakiin qofna uma soo bixin.
You must.	Waa in aad.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
There is always another interest out there.	Had iyo jeer waxaa jira xiiso kale halkaas.
I also love this one.	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclahay kan.
You do not need to tell me.	Uma baahnid inaad ii sheegto.
You are just like everyone else.	Waxaad la mid tahay dadka kale oo dhan.
You may not be very happy	Ma laga yaabaa in aad u faraxsan
But this cannot be done.	Laakiin tan lama samayn karo.
There may be a chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto fursad.
Something was going to happen soon.	Wax ayaa dhici lahaa dhawaan.
I gave everything.	Wax walba waan siiyay.
he is ready.	diyaar ayuu u yahay.
I love it all, too.	Dhammaan waan jeclahay, sidoo kale.
That is a real challenge.	Taasi waa wax adag oo dhab ah.
I think the obvious.	Waxaan u malaynayaa cidda iska cad.
I think you can find him.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad ka heli karto isaga.
I could not have imagined anything better.	Wax ka fiican maan malayn karin.
I would even sometimes see him.	Xitaa mar mar ayaan arki lahaa isaga.
He would always be there.	Mar walba wuu joogi lahaa.
He tried to be.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu noqdo.
I put it somewhere else.	Meel kale ayaan dhigay.
We were robbed.	Waa nala dhacay.
I was very impressed with him.	Aad ayaan ula dhacay isaga.
Probably not.	Malaha waa in aanay jirin.
I have nothing.	waxba ma hayo.
Everything is the same.	Wax walba waa isku mid.
But tell me.	Laakiin ii sheeg.
She would do it.	Way samayn lahayd.
It's all a lie.	Dhammaan waa been.
It was what he knew.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu ogaa.
Certainly not everything.	Hubaal wax walba maaha.
Only you are.	Kaliya waxaad tahay.
You know you will.	Waad ogtahay inaad yeeli doonto.
But for me, it’s great for me.	Laakiin aniga, way igu weyn tahay.
.	.
But again it was nothing.	Laakiin mar kale waxba ma ahayn.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay.
A few other things.	Waxyaabo kale oo dhowr ah.
But you will see things quickly.	Laakiin si degdeg ah ayaad wax u arki doontaa.
I thought that was it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi tahay.
I thought it was the next thing.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay waxa soo socda.
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
Much is for sure.	In badan ayaa la hubaa.
More than ever.	Si ka badan sidii hore.
It always is.	Had iyo jeer waa.
For the most part, this is so.	Inta badan, tani waa sidaas.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I have	waan hayaa
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I knew a lot.	Wax badan ayaan ogaa.
Someone to talk to.	Qof uu la hadli karo.
I am here a lot.	Wax badan ayaan halkan joogaa.
Take a chance.	Fursad qaado.
I don't feel that now.	Hadda ma dareemayo sidaas.
Lots of help.	Caawin badan.
I'm glad you had a great time.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad waqti fiican ku jirto.
Let someone else go.	Qof kale ha tago.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
He was not ready.	Diyaar uma ahayn.
We will be there when you need us.	Waxaan halkaas joogi doonaa marka aad noo baahan tahay.
He doesn't seem to have friends.	Uma eka in uu saaxiibo leeyahay.
I like.	Waan jeclahay.
He has no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma leh.
I must.	Waa in aan.
They didn't really say it.	Si dhab ah uma ay odhan.
I can do a lot	Wax badan baan qaban karaa
I found you later.	Waan ku helay mar dambe.
He knows it very well.	Si fiican ayuu u garanayaa.
I'm sure they will pay.	Waxaan hubaa inay bixin doonaan.
I will not say it again.	Mar dambe ma odhan doono.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
You just can’t leave a chance.	Kaliya kama tagi kartid fursad.
We are very happy.	Waanu aad ugu faraxsanahay.
He should not have seen anything like it.	Ma ahayn inuu arko wax la mid ah.
I am really happy now.	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay hadda.
He has to be here.	Waa inuu halkaan joogo.
You can do anything.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta.
There is so much to love here.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la jecel yahay halkan.
She should have seen it.	Waxay ahayd inuu arko.
He will tell you when he is ready.	Wuxuu kuu sheegi doonaa marka uu diyaar noqdo.
There is no way to see.	Ma jirto si uu wax u arko.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
That was a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
I did everything for him.	Wax walba waan u sameeyay.
It's a little too smart to say.	Waa yara caqli badan tahay in la sheego.
Really, I would really like.	Runtii, runtii waan jeclaan lahaa.
I felt like someone else.	Waxaan dareemay sidii qof kale.
She probably had.	Waxay u badan tahay inay lahayd.
It will not be urgent.	Ma noqon doono mid degdeg ah.
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
There is very little work.	Ma jiro shaqo aad u yar.
I will tell you that you said so.	Waxaan u sheegi doonaa inaad sidaas tidhi.
But you can tell me anything you want.	Laakiin waxaad ii sheegi kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
He knew he could get it.	Wuu ogaa inuu heli karo.
It can happen to you.	Way kugu dhici kartaa.
I want to get to know you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku barto.
This was not correct.	Tani sax ma ahayn.
There was nothing she could do here.	Ma jirin wax ay halkan ka qaban karto.
I know how to do it.	Waan ogahay sida loo sameeyo.
I want it done right.	Waxaan rabaa in si sax ah loo sameeyo.
You did well.	Si fiican ayaad u samaysay.
He is like me.	Waa aniga oo kale.
I will never believe it.	Weligay ma rumaysan doono.
He was a very, very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
There was nothing else but that.	Wax kale ma jirin oo aan taas ahayn.
Otherwise, that’s great too.	Haddii kale, taasi aad bay u fiican tahay sidoo kale.
He did not say what happened.	Ma sheegin waxa dhacay.
He did not say when the payment would be made.	Ma sheegin wax waqti ah oo lacag bixin ah.
Really, very little.	Run ahaantii, aad u yar.
I got it most of the time.	Inta badan waan helay.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
But that was what he heard.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxa uu maqlay.
That is.	Taasi waa.
I had to eat.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax cuno.
You can't talk to me.	Waxba igama aad hadli karin.
Can you make another one at home.	Ma samayn kartaa mid kale oo guriga ah.
Maybe another one.	Malaha mid kale.
This is a minor problem	Tani waa dhib yar
It was for a man to do that.	Waxay ahayd in nin sidaas sameeyo.
It is now one year.	Hadda waa hal sano.
And it was.	Oo waxay ahayd.
We are still good friends.	Wali waxaan nahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I wouldn’t have had much of a chance against it, that’s true.	Ma aanan heli lahayn fursad badan oo ka dhan ah, taasi waa run.
Much has been said about who you are.	Wax badan ayaa laga sheegay qofka aad tahay.
He refused.	Wuu sii diiday.
You can go home again.	Waxaad mar kale aadi kartaa guriga.
He can still do it.	Weli wuu samayn karaa.
What else would it be.	Maxaa kale oo ay noqon lahayd.
The latter did the same.	Kii dambe ayaa sidoo kale sameeyay.
It is so close, there is not enough space.	Aad ayuu u dhow yahay, ma jirto meel ku filan.
Maybe he can talk.	Malaha wuu la hadli karaa.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
He became a much larger man.	Waxa uu noqday nin aad uga badan.
Probably not.	Malaha ma jiraan.
No one did anything.	Qofna waxba ma samayn.
Goed out for food.	U baxay cunto.
Which he does right.	Taas oo uu si sax ah u sameeyo.
there is a lot to say if you want to.	waxaa jira wax badan oo lagu sheegi karo haddii aad rabto.
I really like to talk to you.	Runtii waan jeclahay inaan kula hadlo.
I want to talk.	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadlo.
Let me talk a little.	Aan wax yar ka hadlo.
She did.	Way samaysay.
It was not me.	Aniga ma ahayn.
I would always win.	Mar walba waan guulaysan lahaa.
You may not believe it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan rumaysan.
He may be a person.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu qof yahay.
But it is difficult for him to stay with us.	Laakiin way ku adag tahay inuu nala joogo.
I know he can do that.	Waan ogahay inuu taas samayn karo.
You know what happened.	Waad ogtahay waxa dhacay.
Not all of them.	Dhammaan ma jiraan.
That’s how you want it, not you.	Taasi waa sida aad rabto, ma aha.
It is not an exciting time.	Ma aha waqti xiiso leh.
I thought there was.	Waxaan u malayn jiray inay jirto.
There is something.	Wax baa jira.
But that is another matter.	Laakiin taasi waa tan kale.
.	.
That is what he wanted.	Taasi waa waxa uu rabay.
I think every one of us can do that.	Waxaan filayaa in qof kasta oo naga mid ah uu taas samayn karo.
I became that.	Waxaan noqday taas.
But it is very common.	Laakiin aad bay u badan tahay.
They need another idea.	Waxay u baahan yihiin fikrad kale.
There is still time.	Weli wakhti ayaa jira.
I thought you would do something about it.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad wax ka qaban doonto.
It is a difficult problem.	Waa dhibaato adag.
He did not say why.	Ma uusan sheegin sababta.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
A man came out.	Nin baa ka soo baxay.
John started later.	Yooxanaa wuxuu bilaabay ka dib.
Every day was the same every day.	Maalin kasta waxay la mid ahayd maalin kasta.
But this is really the case.	Laakiin tani dhab ahaantii waa sidaas.
I entered	waan galay
Maybe I shouldn’t talk about it.	Malaha waa inaanan ka hadlin.
I guess there isn’t much you can do.	Waxaan filayaa inaysan jirin wax badan oo aad sameyn karto.
And prophesy.	Oo sii sheeg.
We will help you	Waanu kaa caawin doonaa
I will do it.	Waan sameyn doonaa.
I need to know what you want.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inaad rabto.
We were also free.	Waxaan sidoo kale ahayn lacag la'aan.
But that is enough.	Laakiin taasi waa ku filan tahay.
It looks small.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid yar .
What's going on.	Maxaa socda.
Maybe a little excited.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in yar oo faraxsan.
I hope someone can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof ku caawin karo.
Please tell me what you told me.	Fadlan u sheeg waxaad ii sheegtay.
Not too long ago too, you.	Ma aad u dheer ka hor sidoo kale, adiga.
I don’t think he got much.	U malayn maayo inuu wax badan helay.
He knew it would not happen.	Wuu ogaa in aanay dhici doonin.
It's great.	Waa wax aad u fiican.
I want to talk about it now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan hadda ka hadlo.
Really no one is sure.	Runtii qofna ma hubo.
Tell me where he is.	Meesha uu joogo ii sheeg.
I have something to say.	waxaan leeyahay wax aan sheego.
Everyone knows.	Qof walba wuu garanayaa.
And as he said too.	Iyo sida uu u yidhi sidoo kale.
You do not have to do it alone.	Ma aha inaad keligaa sameyso.
Maybe you are a new and interesting person.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tahay qof cusub oo xiiso leh.
She had an idea.	Waxay lahayd fikrad.
As much as everywhere.	Sida ugu badan meel kasta.
That is a promise.	Taasi waa ballan.
I'm sure it's the same all the time.	Waxaan hubaa inay isku mid tahay mar kasta.
I really want to know.	Runtii waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado.
I would not go home	Guriga ma aadi lahaa
I think that's not true.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi run ahayn.
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
They may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan haysan.
Something happened to him.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
You should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaad ogaato.
No luck, either.	Nasiib ma jiro, sidoo kale.
He told everyone he loved, anyone but me.	Wuxuu u sheegay qof kasta oo uu jecel yahay, qof kasta oo aan aniga ahayn.
I will definitely do this again.	Dhab ahaantii waan samayn doonaa tan mar kale.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
What a man.	Waa maxay nin.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi ma jirto.
Very little but for sure.	Aad u yar laakiin hubaal.
There was a lot.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
This is not popular.	Tani maaha mid la jecel yahay.
Only the best will do it.	Kaliya kan ugu fiican ayaa sameyn doona.
What I did not have was food.	Waxa aan haysan ayaa ahaa cunto.
Now he has taken it.	Hadda wuu qaatay.
What happened is clear.	Waxa dhacay waa cad yahay.
I won't say much.	Wax badan ma odhan doono.
I will have to do this again and again.	Waa inaan tan mar kale sameyn doonaa mar mar.
Hard, it is.	Adag, waa.
The reason for this was obvious.	Sababta taasi waxay ahayd mid cad.
It’s something, it’s everything.	Waa wax, waa wax walba.
But it was hard work.	Laakiin waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
He did what he had to do.	Wuxuu sameeyay wixii uu samayn lahaa.
This is work.	Tani waa shaqo.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
Maybe this, really.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani, dhab ahaantii.
I refused.	waan diiday.
That is a good thing.	Taas oo ah wax wanaagsan.
I really have no idea here.	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama hayo halkan.
It can be anything.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax walba.
I can give you everything he can and more.	Waxaan ku siin karaa wax kasta oo uu awoodo iyo wax ka badan.
I didn't want to surprise anyone.	Maan rabin inaan qof la yaabo.
I am exactly the same.	Anigu waxaan ahay isku si sax ah.
No one is home.	Qofna guriga ma jiro.
We need to do this.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan samayno tan.
I also had this issue.	Waxa kale oo aan lahaa arrintan.
I heard something happened	Waxaan maqlay wax dhacay
That’s enough, right.	Taasi waa ku filan, sax.
No one can find it.	Qofna ma heli karo.
I think everyone will do that now.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in qof walba uu hadda samayn doono taas.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
It was nothing new.	Wax cusub ma ahayn.
I think we will see.	Waxaan filayaa inaan arki doono.
That was really true for us.	Runtii taasi run bay noo ahayd.
But him too.	Laakiin isaga sidoo kale.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
It’s mostly like people.	Inta badan waa sida dadka.
Someone to see.	Qof la arko.
She did not understand.	Ma ay fahmin.
She thinks of one.	Waxay u malaynaysaa mid ka mid ah.
At first I didn't see anything.	Markii hore waxba maan arag.
You can't leave the door.	Ma bixin kartid albaabka.
It is really good for you.	Runtii way kuu fiican tahay.
I know, you would like more.	Waan ogahay, inaad wax badan jeclaan lahayd.
He is back now.	Hadda ayuu soo noqday.
He really came in.	Runtii wuu soo galay.
It really is.	Waa runtii.
This is exactly what we need.	Tani waa dhab ahaan waxa aan u baahanahay .
That, of course, is bad.	Taasi, si hubaal ah, waa xun.
I love being a man.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan noqdo nin.
It was here.	Waxay ahayd halkan.
I will be.	Waxaan ahaan doonaa.
I thought.	Waxaan mooday inay.
I love that.	Waan ku jeclahay taas.
I hardly think that is true.	Si dhib ah uma maleynayo inay taasi run tahay.
It can be so much more.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax aad u badan.
Everything that happened to me belongs to me.	Wax kasta oo igu dhacay aniga ayaa iska leh.
Much closer.	Wax badan ka dhow.
It's like a prison.	Waa sida xabsiga.
He no longer liked it.	Mar dambe ma uu jeclayn.
He would give her as much as she needed.	Wuu siin lahaa inta ay u baahan tahay.
I love it so far.	Waan jeclahay ilaa hadda.
But he knew what he was doing.	Laakiin wuu ogaa waxa uu sameeyo.
I tried the door.	Waxaan isku dayay albaabka.
He is not a friend.	Ma aha saaxiib.
In fact, it is beautiful.	Dhab ahaantii, way qurux badan tahay.
But he stayed.	Laakiin wuu joogay.
I do the same thing, in the same way, every time.	Waxaan sameeyaa wax la mid ah, si la mid ah, mar kasta.
You are one of them.	Adiga oo ka mid ah.
Anything else, too.	Wax kale, sidoo kale.
Every day, even.	Maalin kasta, xitaa.
But there is more now.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan hadda.
I am happy to work with him.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan la shaqeeyo isaga.
I will not return.	soo noqon maayo.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa mid adag.
That sounds complicated.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid adag.
I think otherwise.	Waxaan u malaynayaa si kale.
Everything else he left behind.	Wax kasta oo kale oo uu ka tagay.
I didn't like this	Maan jeclayn tan
I hope you like him.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay isaga.
Not so, again.	Sidaas maaha, mar kale.
I returned home.	Waxaan ku soo noqday guriga.
And he looked at me.	Oo i eegay.
I am here for you	waan kuu joogaa
That is not for me.	Taasi aniga maaha.
It is probably the best thing to do.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay waxa ugu fiican ee la sameeyo.
It's too bad.	Aad buu u xun yahay.
I can't say enough.	Wax igu filan ma odhan karo.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
another said.	mid kale ayuu yidhi.
But there are many similarities.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo isku mid ah.
She can't stop until she finds out.	Ma joojin karto ilaa ay ka ogaato.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
That was as far as he wanted to go.	Taasi waa ilaa inta uu rabay inuu tago.
All will be well.	Dhammaan way fiicnaan doonaan.
That is no small feat.	Taasi wax yar maaha.
He had something else.	Wax kale ayuu lahaa.
They are very fast.	Aad bay u degdeg badan yihiin.
It's amazing and interesting.	Waa wax la yaab leh oo xiiso leh.
I did not find such.	Maan helin sida.
I know she does.	Waan ogahay inay sameyso.
It would find.	Waxaa ka heli lahaa .
Ah just can't.	Ah kaliya ma awoodo.
I hope we can bring it all together.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan soo wada bixin karno.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
Someone might go.	Qof ayaa laga yaabaa inuu tago.
I saw each one.	Waxaan arkay mid kasta.
One is obviously a very bad job.	Mid ka mid ah sida iska cad waa shaqo aad u xun.
Good day, all.	Maalin wanaagsan, dhammaan.
It was me, just me.	Waxay ahayd aniga, aniga oo kaliya.
I heard it once.	Waxaan maqlay hal mar.
He would come, for sure.	Wuu iman lahaa, hubaal.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
It will get better and they will all get better.	Way fiicnaan doontaa oo dhammaan way fiicnaan doonaan.
She did not see him.	Ma ay arag isaga.
He said for sure.	Wuxuu yidhi hubaal.
One made.	Mid la sameeyay.
This is obviously unnecessary.	Tani waa sida iska cad mid aan loo baahnayn.
That was a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I hope you like being here.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay inaad halkaan joogto.
It may not be early.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan ahayn hore.
You did it again.	Mar kale ayaad samaysay.
Not as he had.	Ma aha sidii uu lahaa.
It was all new.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd wax cusub.
We would not be among them.	Waxaan ka mid ahaan lahayn.
I am the same.	Anigu waxaan ahay isku mid.
What we have to do is not what we always do.	Waxa ay tahay in aan samayno ma aha waxa aan had iyo jeer samayn.
Just saw everything.	Kaliya wax walba arkay.
This was something he was not ready for.	Tani waxay ahayd wax uusan diyaar u ahayn.
Probably nothing else.	Malaha wax kale .
It's very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
It's very interesting, really.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan, runtii.
Very bad, he said.	Aad u xun, ayuu yidhi.
It is something he has consistently done.	Waa wax uu si joogto ah u sameeyay.
I want to, even.	Waxaan rabaa inaan, xitaa.
He wondered why she did it.	Waxa uu la yaabay sababta ay sidaas u samaysay.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
You cannot leave the house.	Guriga kama bixi kartid.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jirto.
Fast, affordable, hassle-free.	Degdeg, la awoodi karo, dhib la'aan.
I know that was hard.	Waan ogahay taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
No one knows where you are now.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha aad hadda joogto.
This is not surprising and is also not a real problem.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh oo sidoo kale dhib dhab ah maaha.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
I have never seen that before.	Weligay taas hore uma arag.
A little too hard.	Xoogaa aad u adag.
He found it without any problems.	Dhib la'aan buu ku helay.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
It was a good distraction for me.	Waxay ii ahayd mashquul wanaagsan.
It just won’t go away.	Kaliya ma bixi doonto.
He got a lot of familiarity.	Wuxuu helay wax badan oo la yaqaan.
I'm not sure this will help.	Ma hubo in tani ay caawin doonto.
He is really good.	Runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
And very difficult.	Oo aad u adag.
This will help everyone.	Tani waxay caawin doontaa qof walba.
This was later made one.	Tan markii dambe laga dhigay hal.
This is going to be bad	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid xun
He left.	Wuu baxay.
They have to be a bit tough.	Waa in ay xoogaa adag yihiin.
It felt strange.	Waxa la dareemay wax yaab leh.
Here it is very good.	Halkan waa mid aad u fiican.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
I think this is great.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay mid weyn.
I have to find a man like that.	Waa inaan heli karaa nin sidaas oo kale ah.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
Before it really did not exist.	Ka hor inta aanay dhab ahaan sidaas ahaan jirin.
I have seen that it is very common.	Waxa aan arkay in ay aad u badan tahay.
It is done.	Waa la sameeyay.
There was plenty of food.	Waxaa jiray cunto badan.
That includes everything and everyone.	Taas waxaa ku jira wax walba iyo qof walba.
She said it was good for you.	Waxay ku tidhi way kuu fiican tahay.
This is really hard work.	Runtii tani waa shaqo adag.
Then he withdrew.	Ka dib wuu ka noqday.
Is that so bad.	Ma sidaas baa u xun.
I have no idea that.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo taas.
I have everything.	Wax walba waan hayaa.
You are lucky.	Waad nasiib badan tahay.
It is very fast.	Aad bay u degdeg badan tahay.
Nothing, but everything exists.	Waxba ma jiraan, laakiin wax walba waa jiraan.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
That's where he goes.	Waa meesha uu tago.
He said he was not.	Wuxuu sheegay inuusan ahayn.
Now he could not return.	Hadda wuu soo noqon waayay.
He is just very happy.	Kaliya aad ayuu u faraxsan yahay.
This is a good idea.	Tani waa fikrad fiican.
This could be something else.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax kale.
All is well.	Dhammaan waa wanaagsan yihiin.
Now he is.	Hadda waa uu.
I want to talk to him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo.
I have been here several times.	Waxaan halkaan joogay dhowr jeer.
Sure, he does.	Hubaal, wuu sameeyaa.
That’s what we’d like to do first.	Taasi waa waxa aan jeclaan lahayn inaan marka hore samayno.
I will not tell him.	U sheegi maayo.
It's just that.	Waa ka kaliya.
I will be a man.	Waxaan noqon doonaa nin.
The whole place is beautiful.	Meesha oo dhan waa qurux.
But it can be many things.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa waxyaabo badan.
Nothing here.	Wax halkan ah ma jiraan.
It looks real.	Waxay u egtahay mid dhab ah.
There was no one else.	Meesha qof kale ma jirin.
Everyone saw it.	Qof kastaa wuu arkay.
She is smart.	Waa caqli badan tahay.
Nothing came of it.	Waxba kama iman.
One more strike, he said.	Hal shaqo joojin oo kale ayuu is yidhi.
He can see.	Wuu arki karaa.
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
I don't know why this is.	Ma garanayo sababta ay tani u tahay.
He did not get what he wanted.	Wixii uu rabay wuu heli waayay.
She had the same problem.	Waxay lahayd dhibaato isku mid ah.
But really, people.	Laakiin dhab ahaan, dadka.
I can't talk.	Ma la hadli karo.
I used to see.	Waan arki jiray.
He thought it was beautiful.	Wuxuu mooday inay qurux badan tahay.
More than once, in fact.	In ka badan hal mar, dhab ahaantii.
There was money to be made, after all.	Waxaa jiray lacag in la sameeyo, ka dib oo dhan.
He had to do something.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax sameeyo.
Great opportunity.	Fursad weyn.
This is nothing new.	Tani maaha wax cusub.
That is surprising and clear.	Taasi waa wax la yaab leh oo cad.
You would do him a wonderful surprise.	Waxaad isaga u samayn lahayd la yaab aad u wanaagsan.
There just aren't.	Kaliya ma jiraan.
Take it seriously.	Si dhab ah u qaado.
It will stay.	Way joogi doontaa.
You have to be smarter.	Waa inaad ka caqli badan tahay.
I love you, I love you, I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay, ku jeclahay, ku jeclahay.
Can anyone help me please.	Qofna ma i caawin karaa fadlan.
She probably did.	Waxay u badan tahay inay samaysay.
We need your help.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad na caawiso.
He likes to talk.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu hadlo.
We can't talk here.	Halkan kuma hadli karno.
I am always happy to help people.	Had iyo jeer waan ku faraxsanahay inaan caawiyo dadka.
Indeed, this is correct.	Runtii, tani waa sax.
I thought like you want to know.	Waxaan u maleeyay sida aad rabto inaad ogaato.
I can't see this.	Ma arki karo tan.
That is not true.	In aanay run ahayn.
This will be very clear.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u cad.
Tomorrow will be better.	Berrito way fiicnaan doontaa.
He is serious.	Waa uu ka dhab yahay.
Very good.	Mid aad u fiican .
I did something about it.	wax baan ku sameeyay.
It's beautiful.	Waa qurux.
They may not know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan garanayn.
That is not over yet.	Taasi weli kuma dhammaan.
Please stop.	Fadlan jooji.
I guess you are not there yet.	Waxaan filayaa inaadan weli halkaas joogin.
Even better, really.	Xitaa ka sii fiican, dhab ahaantii.
You can't tell anyone this.	Tan qofna uma sheegi kartid.
I'm sure you know that.	Waan hubaa inaad taas ogtahay.
It was beautiful and available.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan oo la heli karo.
Didn't give a good time.	Ma bixin waqti fiican.
We need to talk to you.	Waxaan u baahanahay in nala hadlo.
It's really great.	Run ahaantii way weyn tahay.
But it was the only thing that could be done.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee la samayn karo.
It looks brand new.	Waxay u egtahay mid cusub.
But that will not do any good.	Laakiin taasi wax wanaagsan ma yeeli doonto.
I think he should have told her first.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd inuu marka hore u sheego.
Surprisingly, he is almost right.	Waxaa la yaab leh, inuu ku dhow yahay inuu sax yahay.
It is not a job.	Ma aha shaqo.
There should be no urgency.	Ma aha in ay jiraan wax degdeg ah.
He wanted her to know.	Wuxuu rabay inay ogaato.
I should have known.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado.
It is a place of learning.	Waa meel wax lagu barto.
And I found nothing.	Oo waxba ma helin.
"It's good," he said.	Way fiican tahay ayuu yidhi.
This can be seen as very familiar.	Tan waxaa loo arki karaa mid aad loo yaqaan.
But there is one.	Laakiin waxaa jira mid.
No one knew.	Cidna ma uu garanayn.
I dont understand.	Maan fahmin.
Now it is	Hadda waa
I set that up.	Taas ayaan dhigay.
It didn't do much.	Wax badan ma qaban.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
Maybe it's something else.	Malaha waa wax kale.
And there was something else.	Oo waxaa jiray wax kale.
I was anonymous.	Waxaan ahaa mid aan la garanayn.
Let me tell you what happened to me.	Aan kuu sheego waxa igu dhacay.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
He probably already knew he had one.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu hore u ogaa inuu mid helay.
I wondered why.	Waxaan la yaabay sababta.
You are very good.	Aad baad u fiican tahay.
You will be fine now.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa hadda.
He has done it before.	Hore ayuu u sameeyay.
Not me.	Aniga ma aha .
It was probably a coincidence.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd wax iska dhacay.
Maybe we are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan nahay.
I wish I could do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas samayn.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ma rabo inuu ka hadlo.
Like, really big.	Sida, si dhab ah u weyn.
I'm not smart	Caqli ma ihi
That will be interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
He really didn’t like to talk about it.	Dhab ahaantii ma jeclayn inuu ka hadlo.
That’s all good and good.	Taasi waa dhan fiican oo wanaagsan.
He did not get what he wanted.	Ma uusan helin wuxuu heli lahaa.
This, too, probably did not happen.	Tani, sidoo kale, waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn wax ku dhacay.
They have not been together for a long time.	Ma wada joogin wakhti dheer.
That is why she could not.	Taasi waa sababta ay u awoodi wayday.
It will be very good.	Aad bay u fiicnaan doontaa.
How? 	Sidee?
It just can’t happen.	Kaliya ma dhici karto.
I thought it could happen to him.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay ka dhici karto isaga.
It was placed there.	Halkaas ayaa la dhigay.
He would not stay.	Ma uu joogi lahaa.
I really like it !.	Runtii waan jeclahay!.
Everyone knew he was very bad.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa inuu aad u xun yahay.
Really, nothing.	Run ahaantii, waxba maaha.
This can be very positive.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
As each of you does.	Sida mid kasta oo kaa mid ah uu sameeyo.
Not sure if that includes ?.	Ma hubo inay taasi ku jirto?.
They left me.	Iga tagay.
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
Tonight would have been better.	Caawa ayaa fiicnaan lahayd.
Taken from me.	La iga qaatay.
He always did as he said.	Had iyo jeer wuxuu samayn jiray sidii uu yidhi.
I wish everyone did.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in qof walba sameeyo.
This is what came out.	Tani waa waxa soo baxay.
I would love to see you there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko halkaas
There was a lot.	Wax badan ayaa jiray.
I know what you did.	Waan ogahay waxaad samaysay.
I should have known you couldn’t get out of it.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado inaadan ka soo bixi karin.
Slightly smaller, now.	In yar ka yar, hadda.
Once is enough.	Mar baa ku filan.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan.
He would find someone else.	Qof kale ayuu heli lahaa.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
Do not take too much.	Wax badan ha qaadan.
That was home.	Taasi waxay ahayd guriga.
He wanted to lie.	Been buu rabay.
I'm happy to have you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan ku haysto.
Everything we need is the same.	Wax kasta oo aan u baahan nahay waa isku mid.
They don't have to.	Ma aha inay sameeyaan.
No one was present.	Qofna ma joogin.
The little man is also very hard to know.	Nin yar ayaa sidoo kale aad u adag in la ogaado.
It is better not to say anything.	Waxaa fiican inaadan waxba u sheegin.
And well.	Oo si fiican .
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
That is what they really need.	Taasi waa waxa ay runtii u baahan yihiin.
That was the best thing she could do.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan ee ay samayn karto.
You should not say the same thing.	Waa inaadan ku hadlin wax la mid ah.
They may make a lot of money.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay lacag badan sameeyaan.
He was a man, after all.	Waxa uu ahaa nin, ka dib oo dhan.
But not in the same way.	Laakiin ma aha si la mid ah.
I tried.	Waxaan isku dayay.
Still, no one came to the door.	Weli, qofna ma iman albaabka.
This is all we need.	Tani waa waxa aan u baahanahay oo dhan.
I can do it	waan samayn karaa
I do not lie.	Been ma sheego.
Also, nothing was true.	Sidoo kale, waxba run ma ahayn.
The better, the better, the better.	Wanaagsan, ka sii fiican, ugu fiican.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
I will stop	waan joojin doonaa
At home, less.	Guriga, wax ka yar.
That is not desirable.	Taasi maaha mid la jecel yahay.
Now everyone is here.	Hadda qof walba waa halkan.
But often it is not.	Laakiin inta badan maaha.
I am very happy to be with you today.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan maanta kula joogo.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
Quick and all.	Degdeg iyo dhammaan.
That was three years ago and now.	Taasi waxay ahayd saddex sano ka hor iyo hadda.
I thought I would have a good time.	Waxaan mooday inaan waqti fiican qaadan doono.
It is not a new problem.	Maaha dhibaato cusub.
I don't think I am a person.	Uma maleynayo inaan qof ahay.
Please stay with us.	Fadlan ha nala joogo.
You are what he has now.	Waxaad tahay waxa uu haysto hadda.
This is bay.	Tani waa bay.
He wants to see what comes next.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu arko waxa soo socda.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
Can you find that true?	Taasi run ma ka heli kartaa?.
It was not what you did.	Ma ahayn waxaad samaysay.
I don't mind.	Waxba kama qabo.
It is now close.	Hadda wuu dhow yahay.
He wants to come home, to see.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu guriga yimaado, si uu u arko.
He thought it would happen.	Wuu mooday inay dhici doonto.
But it is still interesting.	Laakiin weli waa mid xiiso leh.
You don't have to be there to find out.	Ma ahayn inaad halkaas joogto si aad u ogaato.
This was no small feat.	Tani ma ahayn wax yar.
Who will believe this.	Yaa rumaysan doona tan.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Maybe another friend.	Malaha saaxiib kale.
No one.	Cidna.
You know you want it.	Waad ogtahay inaad rabto.
Maybe it was, a little bit.	Malaha waxay ahayd, wax yar.
Something was going to happen.	Wax ayaa dhici lahaa.
I want this.	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan rabo.
Maybe very good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u fiican.
That is correct with me.	Taasi waa ila sax.
He had no money.	Lacag ma uu haysan.
There are still some problems.	Weli waxaa jira xoogaa dhibaato ah.
But she could not.	Laakiin way awoodi wayday.
But really.	Laakiin si dhab ah .
No one told me.	Mid uu ii sheegay ma jiro.
It looks great.	Aad ayuu u muuqdaa.
It is something else.	Wax kale ayaa ah.
You can leave now	Hadda waad bixi kartaa
He is indeed a very good man.	Runtii waa nin aad u fiican.
I couldn’t stop immediately	Si degdeg ah ayaan u joojin waayay
He was there for all.	Wuu joogay dhammaan.
It will happen most of the time.	Inta badan way dhici doontaa.
They may not know it better.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay si ka sii fiican u garanayn.
Now, you can see that.	Hadda, taas waad arki kartaa.
I know she did.	Waan ogahay inay samaysay.
Now he knows what to do.	Hadda wuu garanayaa wuxuu sameeyo.
For the most part, the better.	Inta badan, ayaa ka sii wanaagsan.
I will talk to him.	Waan la hadli doonaa isaga.
I like.	waan jeclahay.
That will be very interesting.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
This would happen.	Tani way dhici lahayd.
I hold it beautifully as it is.	Waxaan si qurux badan u hayaa sida ay tahay.
Not after what happened here.	Ma ahan ka dib waxa halkan ka dhacay.
I have never seen this before.	Weligay tan hore uma arag.
There is nothing you need to do.	Ma jiraan wax aad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
This is not one.	Tani maaha mid.
I would be in prison now.	Waxaan ahaan lahaa xabsiga hadda.
I will do it soon.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa dhawaan.
I am a very bad person.	Waxaan ahay qof aad u xun.
And don't stop.	Oo ha joojin.
He is always close to us.	Mar walba wuu noo dhow yahay.
They did not succeed.	Ma ay guulaysan.
Everything is in it.	Wax walba waa ku jira.
Today, it was not a bad day.	Maanta, maalin xun ma ahayn.
Maybe he's right, maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sax yahay, malaha.
Very good for one as well.	Aad bay ugu fiican tahay mid sidoo kale.
There is nothing else really needed.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo run ahaantii loo baahan yahay .
This is something new for me.	Tani waa wax igu cusub.
You can have it	Waad haysan kartaa
To be seen.	In la arko.
All at once.	Dhammaan hal mar.
I am very happy to be here.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
It was as it was.	Waxay ahayd sidii ay ahayd.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
Everyone is a friend.	Qof walba waa saaxiib.
If done, it will all be better.	Haddii la sameeyo, oo dhan ayaa ka sii wanaagsan.
It is often non-existent.	Inta badan waa wax aan jirin.
They’re tough, which is nice.	Way adag yihiin, taas oo fiican.
It was supposed to be great.	Waxay ahayd inay ahayd wax aad u fiican.
I think she is a man.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay nin.
Very surprised !.	Aad u la yaabay!.
But no one else does.	Laakiin qof kale ma sameeyo.
I hope to get to know you better.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan si fiican kuu ogaado.
You can really get it all.	Runtii waad heli kartaa dhammaan.
But what good.	Laakiin maxaa wanaagsan.
I have to say.	Waa inaan sheego.
I really didn't like school	Runtii maan jeclayn dugsiga
And very good.	Oo aad u fiican.
I know he's here, somewhere.	Waan ogahay inuu halkan joogo, meel.
I wonder if it is true.	Waxaan la yaabanahay inay run tahay.
I have to help	Waa inaan caawiyo
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
I just want to be friends.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan saaxiibo noqdo.
He did not succeed.	Kuma guulaysan.
I think this can help.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ku caawin karto.
He constantly wants me from him.	Wuxuu si joogto ah iga rabaa isaga.
Even that.	Xitaa taas.
Me too.	Aniga sidoo kale.
He came to me every day.	Maalin walba wuu ii iman jiray.
I didn't get anything.	Waxba igama helin.
That is a promise.	Taasi waa ballan.
I am the only one.	aniga kaliya ayaan ahay.
This is great.	Tani waa wax weyn.
But she should be happy.	Laakiin waa inay faraxsan tahay.
He was constant.	Wuxuu ahaa mid joogto ah.
That was a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
Now we will get it.	Hadda waanu heli doonaa.
You really don’t want to know.	Runtii ma rabto inaad ogaato.
How does he know.	Sidee ayuu u garanayaa.
There was nothing right.	Wax sax ah ma jirin.
It will be allowed.	Waa la ogolaan doonaa.
Most of what he did could not be discussed.	Inta badan waxa uu sameeyay ayaa laga wada hadli waayay.
I got a lot.	Waxaan helay wax badan.
As much as he wanted, he could not get it.	Inta uu rabo, wuu heli waayay.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
No one told him to do it.	Qofna uma sheegin inuu sameeyo.
You can only be.	Waxaad noqon kartaa oo kaliya.
He has to do something.	Waa in uu wax sameeyo .
And so you should.	Oo sidaas waa inaad.
Even more than a few.	Xitaa in ka badan dhowr.
I didn't like that.	Ma jeclayn taas.
But even this was not all.	Laakiin xitaa tani ma ahayn dhammaan.
They haven't seen me in a long time.	Muddo dheer ima ay arag.
Maybe, he knew why she was here.	Malaha, wuu ogaa sababta ay halkan u joogto.
And still do not believe me.	Oo weli ima rumaysan.
It was for someone else.	Waxay u ahayd qof kale.
There is even money to be made here.	Waxaa jira xitaa lacag halkan lagu sameeyo.
Even more so, really.	Xitaa ka sii badan, runtii.
Another, they are very interesting.	Mid kale, aad bay u xiiso badan yihiin.
I think this is a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay fikrad fiican.
He said he would stay.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu sii joogi doono.
You will also need to know how it feels as well.	Waxaad sidoo kale u baahan doontaa inaad ogaato sida uu dareemayo sidoo kale.
This will do nothing.	Tani waxba ma qaban doonto.
I want you to always be happy.	Waxaan rabaa inaad mar walba faraxsan tahay.
Here is why.	Waa kan sababta.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
difficult, but true.	adag, laakiin run.
It was uninteresting.	Waxay ahayd mid aan xiiso lahayn.
And once was at work.	Oo mar ayaa shaqada ku jiray.
It is very much needed.	Aad baa loo baahan yahay.
It had nothing to do with it.	Waxba kuma lahayn.
No one wants to tell for sure.	Qofna ma rabo inuu si dhab ah u sheego.
He just seemed to have a place to help.	Waxa kaliya oo uu u muuqday meel uu ku caawin karo.
If he felt.	Haddii uu dareemay.
It is not known whether this was the case.	In tani ay sidaas ahayd lama garanayo.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
Only if you will allow me.	Haddii aad ii ogolaan doonto oo kaliya.
I need to say.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sheego.
He will find me.	Wuu i heli doonaa.
I was with him.	waan la joogay.
Probably always.	Waxay u badan tahay had iyo jeer.
He is really smart.	Runtii aad buu u caqli badan yahay.
I decided it would be better to separate.	Waxaan go'aansaday inay fiicnaan lahayd inaan kala tago.
Apparently she lied.	Waxaa cad in ay been sheegtay.
I wanted most of all.	Waxaan rabay in ugu badan oo dhan.
But it is amazing.	Laakiin waa yaab.
Bad things have happened here.	Waxyaabo xun ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
But not too long.	Laakiin ma aha waqti aad u dheer.
Still not sure.	Wali lama hubo.
This is obviously not a good thing.	Tani sida cad maaha mid wanaagsan.
So he looked.	Sidaas buu u eegay.
But we can't do this.	Laakiin ma samayn karno tan.
Everyone has one.	Qof walba hal buu leeyahay.
You would probably say something about it now.	Waxaa hubaal ah inaad wax ka odhan lahayd hadda.
But not everyone.	Laakiin ma aha qof walba.
It was very, very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad iyo aad u xiiso badan.
At best.	Sida ugu fiican.
Otherwise, I did not.	Haddii kale, ma samayn.
You can't leave.	Kama bixi kartid.
But it didn't matter to me.	Laakiin aniga waxba igama lahayn.
But they live there.	Laakiin halkaas bay ku nool yihiin.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma hayo .
I saw you all over the room.	Qolka oo dhan ayaan kaa arkay.
He really didn't understand.	Runtii ma uu fahmin.
To pick something up again.	Si wax loo soo qaado mar kale.
To be told what to do.	In loo sheego waxa la sameeyo.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
In fact, there is no money.	Dhab ahaantii, lacag ma jirto.
I can't do that.	Taas ma awoodo.
I don't have much to tell you.	Wax badan oo aan kuu sheego ma hayo.
I just don’t know that.	Kaliya taas ma garanayo.
I like.	Waan jeclahay.
I will never do that now.	Weligay taas hadda ma yeeli doono.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah maaha.
He does that to people.	Taas ayuu dadka ku sameeyaa.
He is a man who has a lot to say.	Waa nin wax badan oo uu sheego.
It looks popular and available.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid la jecel yahay oo la heli karo.
I do nothing wrong.	Wax xun ma sameeyo.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah .
I'll tell you how to get it.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa sida loo helo.
Bad is bad.	Xun ayaa xun.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
That is not a coincidence.	Taasi wax iska dhacay maaha.
I know it's real.	Waan ogahay inuu dhab yahay.
No one leaves.	Qofna kama tago.
You would say a lot.	Wax badan baad odhan lahayd.
You can tell us what happened later.	Wixii dhacay dib ayaad noo sheegi kartaa.
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
Both are very good.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin.
It’s all about you.	Waa adiga oo dhan.
I had one there.	Mid baan halkaas ku lahaa.
I found	waan helay
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
Everyone wanted to work, but there was nothing to do.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu shaqeeyo, laakiin ma jirin wax la sameeyo.
You can say really bad.	Runtii si xun baad u odhan kartaa.
That is very rare.	Taasi aad bay u yar tahay.
If that's not true it doesn't really matter.	Haddii taasi aysan sax ahayn runtii dhib ma leh.
Everything is like that.	Wax walba waa sidaas oo kale.
I heard you.	Waan kaa maqlay.
He was even ready to go as before.	Wuxuu xitaa diyaar u ahaa inuu tago sidii hore.
Not only here.	Halkan kaliya maaha.
We just need it.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay.
It would be nice for me not to talk.	Way ii fiicnaan lahayd inaanan hadlin.
I have no problem doing that.	Dhib igama haysto inaan taas sameeyo.
I can't see anything.	Waxba ma arki karo.
He knew full well that they could not help it.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa in aanay caawin karin.
I had no idea who she was.	Wax fikrad ah kama haysan cidda ay tahay.
And good old, too.	Oo hore fiican, sidoo kale.
But only one.	Laakiin mid kaliya.
It can happen.	Way dhici kartaa.
He came out.	Wuu ka soo baxay.
I would never do that.	Weligay sidaas uma yeeli lahayn.
You told me.	Waad ii sheegtay.
It was not a coincidence.	Ma ahayn wax iska dhacay.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I can love it forever.	Waan jeclaan karaa weligay.
I wanted the job.	Waxaan rabay shaqada.
I was at home.	Waxaan joogay guriga.
It can be made from anything.	Waxay laga samayn karaa wax kasta.
If so, please let us know.	Haddii ay jiraan, fadlan noo soo sheeg.
I spent a lot of money on food there.	Waxaan cunto ku qaatay halkaas lacag badan.
He looked beautiful and happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid qurux badan oo faraxsan.
This is what she needs.	Tani waa waxa ay u baahan tahay.
No one will come.	Qofna ma iman doono.
I make time	waqti ayaan sameeyaa
It was very popular.	Waxay ahayd mid aad loo jecel yahay.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
She told him so.	Waxay u sheegtay sidaas.
But no one came out.	Laakiin qofna uma soo bixin.
Very happy.	Aad u faraxsan.
I can't stop.	Ma joojin karo.
It will be very bad.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
Not available.	Lama heli karo.
This can be time consuming.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa waqti.
Now he did.	Hadda wuu sameeyay.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
You love him.	Waad ku jecel tahay isaga.
It is not difficult.	Ma aha mid adag.
He promised they would.	Wuxuu ballan qaaday inay sameyn doonaan.
I was smart enough to know that.	Waxaan ahaa caqli ku filan inaan taas ogaado.
There was nothing difficult	Ma jirin wax adag
Not anymore.	Mar dambe ma aha.
Still, it was a beautiful place.	Weli, waxay ahayd meel qurux badan.
Maybe she would see.	Malaha way arki lahayd.
This is why he entered.	Tani waa sababta uu u galay.
Another will not hurt.	Mid kale waxba ma yeeli doono.
Give it time.	Waqti sii.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
I can't speak well.	Si fiican uma hadli karo.
He always does this.	Mar walba tan wuu sameeyaa.
A little of this is enough.	In yar oo ka mid ah arrintan ayaa ku filan.
Good idea.	Fikrad fiican.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
Tell them everything.	Wax walba u sheeg.
I was with you every day.	Maalin walba waan kula jiray.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha.
Everything is so bad.	Wax walba oo dhan waa mid aad u xun.
Can you stop him? 	Ma joojin kartaa isaga?
.	.
I would really like.	Runtii waan jeclaan lahaa.
It was too.	Waxay ahayd sidoo kale.
He can go	Wuu tagi karaa
He did everything.	Wax walba wuu sameeyay.
I think that was to be expected.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd mid la filan karo.
Each of us was given one chance to return.	Mid walba waxa nala siiyay hal fursad oo uu ku noqon karo.
Many of us have told him.	In badan oo naga mid ah ayaa u sheegay isaga.
I was still.	weli waan ahaa.
Take a friend.	Qaado saaxiib.
It was a little weird.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo yaab leh.
That sounds good to me.	Taasi waxay ila tahay wax wanaagsan.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
That is the great thing.	Taasi waa waxa weyn.
Maybe she still did.	Malaha wali way samaysay.
Tell them what happened.	U sheeg waxa dhacay.
Otherwise, you need to know what it is.	Haddii kale, waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxa ay tahay.
She is as good as anyone.	Waxay u fiican tahay sida qof kasta.
You are smart to know that.	Waad caqli badan tahay inaad taas ogaato.
He said that would help.	Wuxuu sheegay in taasi ay caawin doonto.
Tani and eka	Tani kuma eka
He should have been there.	Waxay ahayd inuu halkaas joogo.
.	.
You are very happy.	Aad baad u faraxsan tahay.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale maaha.
Not that.	Ma aha in.
I can't do anything.	waxba ma samayn karo.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
Isn't that right? 	Taasi miyaanay sax ahayn?
Not that it will last long.	Ma aha in ay muddo dheer awoodi doonto.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
And this was great.	Oo tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
More and more, much more.	In badan iyo in ka badan, wax badan ayaa ka badan.
I really like it.	Runtii waan jeclahay.
I have to talk to you.	Waa inaan kula hadlo.
I can help a lot	Wax badan ayaan caawin karaa
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
Now is the time to speak.	Hadda waa markii aan hadlo.
But a bad day, it can be a terrible thing.	Laakiin maalin xun, waxay noqon kartaa wax aad u xun.
I did not get it.	Anigu ma aan helin.
This, of course, was what happened.	Tani, runtii, waxay ahayd wixii dhacay.
Much like you.	Wax badan adiga oo kale.
I'm afraid not.	Waxaan ka baqayaa in aan.
.	.
Maybe I have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan haysto.
This is impossible.	Tani waa wax aan dhici karin.
Even if you haven’t received it yet.	Xitaa haddii aadan weli helin.
I didn't like that.	Maan jeclayn taas.
That’s bad enough, and everyone needs to know.	Taasi waa wax xun oo ku filan, oo qof kastaa wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu ogaado.
I guess you don't know.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaadan ogayn.
I really hope it is true.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inay run tahay.
I love it so much here.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay halkan.
Even to this day.	Xitaa ilaa maanta oo dhan.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Here it is.	Waa ku kan.
It is me and there is none.	Waa aniga iyo aniga ma jiro.
I do not understand.	Ma fahmin.
But he did not come to help me.	Laakiin uma iman inuu i caawiyo.
Certainly not.	Runtii maaha.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
It happened the day before.	Maalin ka hor ayuu ka dhacay.
It is not too late.	Ma aha goor dambe.
I desperately need it, I have it.	Aad ayaan ugu baahanahay, ee aan haysto.
The latter was very interesting.	Tan dambe waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
He had no idea where he was going now.	Ma uusan haysan fikrad yar halka uu hadda aado.
The best people.	Dadka ugu wanaagsan.
They did not give.	Ma ay siin.
Who is closest to you.	Yaa kuu dhow.
No one can hurt you here.	Qofna halkan kuma yeeli karo.
When she is not at work she stays at home.	Markii aanay shaqada ku jirin waxay iska joogto guriga.
I hope only one, too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa mid kaliya, sidoo kale.
It is a very difficult time right now.	Waa wakhti aad u adag hadda.
He wants me to go with him.	Wuxuu rabaa inaan isaga la tago.
It looks like a very, very good time.	Waxay u egtahay wakhti aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
It's just not a good idea.	Kaliya maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
They are much harder.	Aad bay uga adag yihiin.
she was ready for me.	diyaar bay ii ahayd.
I just didn't know if he was serious or not.	Kaliya maan garanayn inuu dhab ka yahay iyo in kale.
That wasn’t too long ago.	Taasi ma ahayn mid aad u dheer ka hor.
But, there is something else.	Laakiin, wax kale ayaa jira.
She didn't want this.	Ma ay rabin tan.
Now it is gone	Hadda waa baxay
And he wanted to come out and work.	Oo wuxuu rabay inuu soo baxo oo uu shaqeeyo.
He knew that for sure.	Wuu ogaa taas hubaal.
But it is permanent.	Laakiin waa joogto.
And who lives today.	Oo yaa maanta nool.
I think it was like that.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas oo kale ahayd.
It is always so.	Had iyo jeer waa sidaas.
And this will happen.	Oo tani way dhici doontaa.
There was nowhere he wanted.	Meel uu rabay ma jirin.
It's hard to go back.	Way adag tahay in lagu noqdo.
Do not speak here	Ha ku hadlin halkan
Everyone fell for it.	Qof walba wuu ku dhacay.
You will stop and stop now.	Waad joojin doontaa oo joojin doontaa hadda.
He did not do what he did not want to do.	Ma uusan sameyn wax uusan rabin.
It was really beautiful.	Runtii waxay ahayd qurux.
I would like to know what it is.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado waxa ay tahay.
What it really was, this was it.	Waxa ay dhab ahaantii ahayd, tani waxay ahayd.
In fact, there is something similar.	Runtii, wax la mid ah ayaa ku jira.
It will always be.	Had iyo jeer wuu ahaan doonaa.
I really hope they don't come back.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan soo noqon.
I like to eat well	Waxaan jeclahay inaan si fiican wax u cuno
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Not everyone sees it that way.	Qof kastaa sidaas uma arko.
First, no one is small.	Marka hore, qofna ma yara.
No one cares about him.	Qofna waxba kuma hayo isaga.
I have to be happy.	Waa inaan faraxsanahay.
It is always there.	Had iyo jeer waa halkaas.
And that you are one of them.	Iyo in aad ka mid tahay.
I will not talk about it anymore.	Hadda ka dib kama hadli doono.
You can't win	Ma guulaysan kartid
I didn't say anything else.	Wax kale maan ka hadlin.
This will happen everywhere.	Tani waxay ka dhici doontaa meel kasta.
This was not a big deal.	Tani ma ahayn mid aad u weyn.
Maybe she already did.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hore u samaysay.
I know you don't like it.	Waan ogahay inaadan jeclayn.
I am closer, after all.	Waxaan ahay mid ka dhow, ka dib oo dhan.
Not until we let him.	Ma aha ilaa aan u ogolaan isaga.
But he still refused.	Laakiin weli wuu diiday.
That was the most.	Taasi waxay ahayd tan ugu badan.
But it was very interesting.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I have never seen that before.	Taas hore uma arag.
It can get even more than before.	Waxay heli kartaa xitaa ka badan sidii hore.
Now he knows that.	Hadda wuu garanayaa taas.
He would love you.	Wuu ku jeclaan lahaa.
I can help him.	Waan caawin karaa isaga.
Please only.	Fadlan kaliya.
Now it's just me.	Hadda waa aniga oo kaliya.
I did not see that.	Taas maan arag.
I was.	Waxaan ahaa.
I know it still exists.	Waan ogahay inay wali jirto.
The less she can keep this, the better.	Inta yar ee ay tan sii haysan karto, ayaa ka sii wanaagsan.
I am always him.	Mar walba isaga ayaan ahay.
Maybe you can help us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad na caawin karto.
He is the one who made it.	Waa isaga kan sameeyay.
That would be something.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd wax.
What he finds is a big problem.	Waxa uu helo waa dhibaato weyn.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu waxba ka ogayn.
That would be bad.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd mid xun.
I thought you were one of us.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad naga mid tahay.
But this was very difficult.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd mid aad u dhib badan.
No problem.	Dhibaato maaha.
enough for you tonight.	wax kugu filan caawa.
I thought you would love to be here.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeceshahay inaan halkaan joogo.
John where.	John meesha.
I was recently.	Waxaan ahaa mid dhawaan.
You know that.	Waad ogtahay taas.
Ah! 	Ah!
But he knows, really.	Laakiin wuu garanayaa, runtii.
It’s so big, that’s great.	Aad bay u weyn tahay, taas oo weyn.
A real problem.	Dhibaato dhab ah.
You have friends.	Waxaad leedahay saaxiibo.
He should not be here.	Waa inuusan halkan joogin.
As you have just said, it is not a big deal.	Sida aad hadda sheegtay, wax weyn maaha.
I'm happy, you know.	Waan ku faraxsanahay, waad ogtahay.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii waan ka helay
He would leave.	Wuu bixi lahaa.
He was not a tough guy.	Ma ahayn nin adag.
It’s an empty space, but it’s everything.	Waa meel aan waxba ahayn, laakiin waa wax walba.
I want to do this right.	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan si sax ah u sameeyo.
That was what she would do.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ay samayn lahayd.
Please tell me more	Fadlan wax badan ii sheeg
You should not think otherwise.	Waa inaadan u malayn si kale.
I was unemployed.	Waxaan ahaa shaqo la'aan.
If you will be good to me.	Haddii aad ii fiicnaan doonto.
I thought it was too big for him.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay aad ugu weyn tahay isaga.
If there is one, please let me know.	Haddii uu jiro mid, fadlan ii soo sheeg.
He had only one.	Mid kaliya ayuu lahaa.
They are good here.	Way ku fiican yihiin halkan.
Now I have heard.	Hadda ayaan maqlay.
It was a long day for him.	Waxay u ahayd maalin dheer isaga.
Exactly less than one year.	Si sax ah wax ka yar hal sano.
I think.	waxaan qabaa .
That is the best.	Taasi waa tan ugu fiican.
No good friend, either.	Ma jiro saaxiib fiican, sidoo kale.
That would not be true.	Taasi sax ma ahaan lahayd.
It exists when you want it.	Waa wax jira marka aad rabto.
Only, you know.	Kaliya, waad ogtahay.
Here is what it really is.	Waa kan waxa runtii ah.
For me, that would leave a little more fun work.	Aniga ahaan, taasi waxay ka tagi lahayd shaqo yar oo xiiso leh.
That is the only thing they are good at.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay ku fiican yihiin.
There is someone else.	Qof kale ayaa jira.
Not just a friend.	Ma aha oo kaliya saaxiib.
You may already have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad hore u leedahay.
But she can't come back now.	Laakiin hadda ma soo noqon karto.
I say it will not happen.	Waxaan leeyahay ma dhici doonto.
Everyone will love it.	Qof walba wuu jeclaan doonaa.
I hope you like it, friend.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay, saaxiib.
I hope you do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso.
I'm not even sure.	Xitaa ma hubo.
We will take something with us.	Wax baan nala qaadan doonaa.
I don't know where to leave here.	Ma garanayo meel aan ka tago halkan.
It’s not too hard, but it’s too much.	Ma aha mid aad u adag, laakiin waa mid aad u badan.
I never got a job.	Weligay shaqo maan helin.
He had a problem.	Dhib buu lahaa.
I have to help him.	Waa inaan caawiyo isaga.
Now he did.	Hadda wuu sameeyay.
Not much, but it would still be nice.	Ma badna, laakiin wali way fiicnaan lahayd.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd qurux badan.
Anything else.	Wax kale .
Nothing else can be done.	Wax kale lama qaban karo.
She did not like him.	Ma ay jeclayn isaga.
I know they exist.	Waan ogahay inay jiraan.
What a problem.	Maxaa dhib ah.
Maybe he was.	Malaha wuxuu ahaa.
It was not a good thing.	Wax wanaagsan ma ahayn.
They really exist.	Runtii way jiraan.
I don’t talk about that.	Kama hadlo taas.
I think you are doing that.	Waxaan filayaa in aad taas samaynayso.
Give me more, please.	Wax badan i sii, fadlan.
Not very beautiful.	Aad uma qurux badna.
Not that she knew he was here, it wasn’t like that.	Ma aha in ay ogtahay inuu halkan joogo, ma aha sidaas oo kale.
That he feels very much about this.	In uu aad u dareemayo arrintan.
He can talk a lot.	Aad ayuu u hadli karaa.
I really have to go home.	Runtii waa inaan aado guriga.
I want to help you	waxaan rabaa inaan ku caawiyo
He should not allow it.	Waa inuusan u ogolaan.
It will never be that way.	Weligay sidaas ma ahaan doono.
He heard enough.	In ku filan ayuu maqlay.
But there was no other time.	Laakiin ma jirin wakhti kale.
It would be great.	Way ku fiicnaan lahayd.
It is very good for me.	Aad bay ii fiican tahay.
I really think this is the best.	Waxaan runtii u maleynayaa in tani ay ugu fiican tahay.
It will not do.	Ma yeeli doonto.
Something strange happened.	Wax la yaab leh ayaa ku dhacay.
This is done once.	Tan waxa la sameeyaa hal mar.
This is a lot of money.	Tani waa lacag aad u badan.
And another one of the same.	Iyo mid kale oo isku mid ah.
But it is not surprising.	Laakiin ma ahan mid la yaab leh.
They could no longer see him.	Mar dambe ma ay arki karin isaga.
You will come as a friend and a friend.	Waxaad u iman doontaa sidii saaxiib iyo saaxiib.
I started to get better.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan si fiican u helo.
I felt so bad.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u xun.
Really, very interesting stuff.	Runtii, waxyaabo aad u xiiso badan.
He decided to go.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu u tago.
But he really didn't want to.	Laakiin run ahaantii ma uu doonayn.
As long as he is happy, she is fine with me.	Ilaa iyo inta uu faraxsan yahay, way ila fiican tahay aniga.
It scares me a bit.	Wuu iga baqayaa xoogaa.
It is difficult to know what is best.	Way adag tahay in la ogaado waxa ugu fiican.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma iga caawin karaa.
So far, very familiar.	Ilaa hadda, aad loo yaqaan.
And let me know.	Oo aan ogaado.
I think she is a person.	Waxaan filayaa inay tahay qof.
it was beautiful.	qurux bay ahayd.
I did not return.	Kuma soo noqon.
But now he has to leave.	Laakiin hadda waa inuu iska tago.
She said, he said.	Waxay tidhi, ayuu yidhi.
It will be interesting.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
It would be nice to know.	Way fiicnaan lahayd in la ogaado.
I know what you are.	Waan ogahay waxaad tahay.
I still know how.	Weli waan ogahay sida.
It may be available.	Waxa laga yaabaa in la heli karo.
That was not a good idea.	Taasi fikrad wanaagsan ma ahayn.
And as always.	Iyo sida had iyo jeer.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
This is small.	Tani waa mid yar.
What was that? 	Maxay ahayd taasi?
Now you will be able to do it.	Hadda waxaad awoodi doontaa inaad sameyso.
I am definitely like you.	Hubaal adiga oo kale ayaan ahay.
Just a bit of a friend.	Kaliya xoogaa saaxiib.
Nothing else will happen to you.	Wax kale kugu dhici maayo.
He was a very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u wanaagsan.
It’s very accurate, too.	Aad bay sax u tahay, sidoo kale.
It was a good thing, too.	Waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
All alone there.	Dhammaan keligaa halkaas.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida uu yahay.
There is nothing to be desired here.	Ma jiraan wax la doonayo halkan.
They will talk closely.	Si dhow bay u hadli doonaan.
I just don’t understand this.	Kaliya ma fahmin tan.
I was one.	Mid baan ahaa.
He was really unable to speak.	Runtii wuu awoodi waayay inuu hadlo.
Maybe we can help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ku caawin karno.
I would love to be there	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas joogo
I need to do it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan sameeyo.
You told me everything.	Wax walba waad ii sheegtay.
Don't do too little at first.	Wax yar ha samayn marka hore.
But, he has not seen one yet.	Laakiin, weli ma uusan arag mid.
A bit longer	Xoogaa dheer
He did.	Waxa uu sameeyay.
She found out she loved the job.	Waxay ogaatay inay jeceshahay shaqada.
It will never be.	Weligay ma ahaan doono.
No one can help please.	Qofna ma caawin karaa fadlan.
Maybe he's a great guy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu yahay nin weyn.
Nothing less true.	Wax run ah kama yara.
Not much, but still.	Ma badna, laakiin weli.
But everything is set.	Laakiin wax walba waa la wada dhigay.
But this is enough.	Laakiin tani waa ku filan tahay.
It was what everyone did.	Waxay ahayd waxa qof walba sameeyay.
I'll talk about that later.	Dib ayaan uga hadli doonaa.
He wanted to know everything.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax walba ogaado.
Something he said.	Wax uu yidhi.
I was a man.	Waxaan ahaa nin.
Probably, there are.	Malaha, way jiraan.
with and.	leh iyo .
That will not do.	Taasi ma yeeli doonto.
Please do not leave me and him.	Fadlan ha iga tagin isaga iyo isaga.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
Why is this so.	Maxay tani sidaas u tahay.
Don't talk to me like that.	Ha ila hadlin sidaas.
You can do many things.	Waxaad samayn kartaa waxyaabo badan.
And let me know how that applies to you.	Oo aan ogaado sida ay taasi adiga kuu tahay.
He can leave now.	Hadda wuu bixi karaa.
That's why no one talked to him.	Waa sababta qofna uusan ula hadlin.
And, you know, that would be nice.	Oo, waad ogtahay, taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
But they did not do this.	Laakiin ma ay samayn tan.
I can get it again	Mar kale ayaan heli karaa
It would not come out.	Ma soo bixi lahayd.
That is not true anymore.	Taasi run dambe uma eka.
They are always difficult.	Had iyo jeer way adag yihiin.
If you are lucky, there is only one.	Haddii aad nasiib leedahay, waxaa jira hal kaliya.
But he will do what he will do.	Laakiin wuu samayn doonaa wuxuu samayn doono.
It can't be right.	Sax ma noqon karto.
He is a good man.	Waa nin fiican.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
I will go for something to eat soon.	Waxaan aadi doonaa wax aan cuno dhawaan.
It looks bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun.
In fact, it wasn’t much.	Run ahaantii, wax badan ma ahayn.
And she did it beautifully.	Oo waxay u samaysay si qurux badan.
Maybe this is true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay run tahay tan.
There is something she has to do.	Waxaa jira wax ay tahay inay sameyso.
She may not understand all that she has done.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay fahmin waxa ay samaysay oo dhan.
But only the latter is correct.	Laakiin kan dambe oo kaliya ayaa sax ah.
I just can’t say enough about him.	Kaliya kama sheegi karo wax ku filan isaga.
I heard it all.	Waan wada maqlay.
One she had.	Mid ay lahayd.
There are some things you need to know.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
This was not too difficult.	Tani ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
That and more.	Taas iyo in ka badan.
It is thought to be all.	Waxaa loo malaynayaa inay dhammaan tahay.
Not likely to be reported.	Ma badna in la soo sheego.
It would not hurt to be held hostage.	Ma yeeli lahayn in la haysto.
Surprisingly, even.	Si la yaab leh, xitaa.
I know, now, why you said that.	Waan ogahay, hadda, sababta aad u tidhi.
Maybe he lost someone.	Malaha wuu waayay qof.
No one would fall for it.	Qofna wuu ku dhici lahaa.
And very, very strange.	Oo aad iyo aad u yaab leh.
Everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
I don't know how he got home.	Sida uu guriga ugu soo noqday ma garanayn.
Please, can you help me	Fadlan, ma i caawin kartaa
See you soon	Dhawaan arag
I have no idea what happened to him.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ku dhacay.
Someone like me.	Qof aniga ila mid ah.
He is thought to be there.	Waxaa loo malaynayaa inuu halkaas joogo.
Give what you want.	Sii waxa aad rabto.
There was no way to know that.	Ma jirin si loo ogaado taas.
I will definitely be !.	Hubaal waan ahaan doonaa!.
At best don't say anything, maybe.	Sida ugu fiican waxba ha odhan, malaha.
You just love it.	Kaliya waad jeceshahay.
You said it was enough	Waad tidhi waa kugu filan
But how to do it.	Laakiin sida loo sameeyo.
He is really smart.	Runtii waa caqli badan yahay.
And it was all over here.	Oo waxay ahayd halkan oo dhan.
And so far.	Oo ilaa hadda.
Someone said.	Qof baa yidhi.
Everything is fine now.	Wax walba hadda way ii wanaagsan yihiin.
Take it and don't stop.	Qaado oo ha joojin.
More to say.	Wax badan in la sheego.
But there is something else as well.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax kale sidoo kale.
He would win, he would definitely win.	Wuu guulaysan lahaa, hubaal wuu guulaysan lahaa.
He is probably in a difficult time.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu ku jiro waqti adag.
He must stay.	Waa inuu joogo.
Lots of money to make.	Lacag badan in la sameeyo.
They will not last long.	Ma sii joogi doonaan wakhti dheer.
It has been around for a long time.	Muddo dheer ayuu soo jiray.
I wanted to be part of it.	Waxaan rabay inaan ka mid noqdo.
In fact, less is better.	Dhab ahaantii, inta yar ayaa ka wanaagsan.
It should not be needed.	Waa inaan loo baahnayn.
I had to do it now.	Waxay ahayd inaan hadda sameeyo.
There was no problem with his whereabouts.	Meesha uu joogo dhib ma lahayn.
That is for others.	Taasi waa dadka kale.
He was alone, as always.	Wuxuu ahaa keligiis, sida had iyo jeer.
This was interesting.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
But that cannot be done.	Laakiin taasi ma samayn karto.
There is no urgency.	Wax degdeg ah ma jiro.
I think there is something.	Waxaan filayaa inay wax jiraan.
I will not do that again.	Mar dambe taas ma samaynayo.
Little was felt.	Wax yar baa la dareemay.
It involves a lot of hard work.	Waxaa ku jira shaqo adag oo badan.
If you are big, you are big.	Haddii aad weyn tahay, waad weyn tahay.
This would be.	Tani waxay noqon lahayd.
She did this.	Waxay samaysay tan.
I'll get some	Waxaan heli doonaa xoogaa
Just left	Kaliya ka tagay
Really, that would be a good thing.	Run ahaantii, taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax wanaagsan.
You have to do better.	Waa in aad taas ka fiican samayso.
Which is very obvious.	Taas oo aad iska cad tahay.
A difficult place.	Meel dhib ah.
No one can help.	Qofna ma caawin karo.
Maybe it was luck.	Malaha waxay ahayd nasiib.
In fact, all.	Dhab ahaantii, dhammaan.
It will not take long for them to make me.	Waqti dheer kuma qaadan doonto inay i sameeyaan.
It does not have to be done.	Ma aha in la sameeyo.
One that never really ends.	Mid aan waligiis run ahaantii dhammaan.
They may always do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay mar walba sameeyaan.
She did not tell him.	Uma ay sheegin.
I couldn’t tell him much.	Wax badan ayaan u sheegi waayay.
Tell them you are here.	U sheeg inaad halkan joogto.
There is something familiar.	Wax la yaqaan baa jira.
It really is so fast.	Runtii waa sidaas degdeg ah.
She said I don't know.	Waxay tidhi ma garanayo.
So, so, so.	Sidaas, sidaas, sidaas.
But enough is enough.	Laakiin ku filan ayaa ku filan.
It won't be long.	Ma noqon doonto waqti dheer.
I do this for work every day.	Waxaan sidaas u sameeyaa shaqada maalin kasta.
No one was there.	Qofna ma jirin.
I don't want to know where.	Ma rabo inaan ogaado meesha.
But it is a good thing to have.	Laakiin waa wax fiican in la haysto.
I want to talk a little bit.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo wax yar.
Maybe what happened is a good thing.	Malaha waxa dhacay waa wax wanaagsan.
You may be lucky.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad nasiib leedahay.
It would be difficult.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid dhib badan.
Someone from here	Qof ka yimid halkan
He looked at me clearly, he said nothing.	Si cad ayuu ii eegay, waxba ma odhan.
Always loved.	Had iyo jeer jecel.
One knows where he is.	Mid meesha uu joogo yaqaan.
It's all a lie.	Dhammaan waa been.
Something he had to do.	Wax ay ahayd inuu sameeyo.
She may have friends, he said.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay saaxiibo leedahay, ayuu yidhi.
I have to go there	Waa inaan halkaas tago
I will win once	mar baan ka guulaysan doonaa
Sure, if you will.	Hubaal, haddii aad rabto.
I have never really done that before.	Weligay taas ma samayn runtii wakhti hore.
I saw enough.	Wax igu filan baan arkay.
Whatever you like.	Wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
Don't give me anything.	Waxba ha i siin.
I am happy to see that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko taas.
He was there, as always.	Halkaas ayuu joogay, sida had iyo jeer.
I can't even tell.	Xitaa ma sheegi karo.
This was so.	Tani waxay ahayd sidaas.
I, soon.	Waan, dhawaan.
What a lucky man.	Maxaa nin nasiib badan ahaa.
They do, really.	Waxay sameeyaan, runtii.
I also know it will not happen.	Sidoo kale waan ogahay inaysan dhici doonin.
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
I became him.	isaga ayaan noqday.
Maybe no one knows who he is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qofna uusan ogeyn cidda uu yahay.
He wanted to do everything.	Wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo wax walba.
But he did not.	Laakiin ma uusan haysan.
It has always been good for me.	Had iyo jeer way igu fiican tahay aniga.
It was like that.	Sidii bay ahayd.
That was really well done.	Taasi runtii si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I was there most of the time.	Waxaan u joogay inta badan.
I have to talk to you	waa inaan kula hadlo
That can't help.	Taas ma caawin karo.
But it will happen.	Laakiin way dhici doontaa.
They are friends.	Waa saaxiibo.
It may still be.	Weli waa laga yaabaa.
But you believe.	Laakiin waad rumaysan tahay.
Lots of money.	Lacag badan.
Don't leave me yet.	Wali ha iga tagin.
I really wish they weren’t.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan ahayn.
That doesn't seem right.	Taasi sax uma eka.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
Don't tell him, please.	Ha u sheegin isaga, fadlan.
Lots of bad stuff.	Wax badan oo xun.
I heard he was ready.	Waxaan maqlay inuu diyaar yahay.
We need constant	Waxaan u baahanahay joogto ah
So far nothing else has been seen.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax kale oo la arko.
I do everything.	Wax walba waan sameeyaa.
That is amazing.	Taasi waa wax la yaab leh.
I love being busy	Waxaan jeclahay mashquul
If they do, it will be beautiful.	Haddii ay sidaas sameeyaan, waxay noqon doontaa mid qurux badan.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
But, I got another one.	Laakiin, mid kale ayaan helay.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
Everyone can say what they want.	Qof kastaa wuxuu sheegi karaa wuxuu doono.
And not bad.	Oo aan si xun.
There are definitely many.	Waxaa hubaal ah inay badan yihiin.
That was quick.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah.
We will be friends.	Waxaan noqon doonaa saaxiibo.
I would like to talk about that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ka hadlo taas.
That will not be a problem.	Taasi dhib ma noqon doonto.
Someone will be done.	Qof la samayn doono.
Maybe not tonight.	Malaha caawa maaha.
But you will get another chance.	Laakiin waxaad heli doontaa fursad kale.
It still looks beautiful.	Wali waxay u egtahay qurux.
I knew you would find me.	Waan ogaa inaad i heli doonto.
It really was a lot.	Runtii waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
He was clearly surprised.	Si cad ayuu ula yaabay.
I will never do it.	Weligay ma yeeli doono.
We were picked up.	Waa nala soo qaaday.
He had to help me.	Waxay ahayd inuu i caawiyo.
I doubt if he felt it.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay haddii uu dareemay.
What will it be.	Maxaa noqon doona.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
Everyone is better.	Qof walba wuu ka fiican yahay.
We would stay here	Waxaan joogi lahayn halkan
I just couldn't stop.	Kaliya waan joojin waayay.
I really have to go now.	Runtii waa inaan aado hadda.
Will I do something about it?	Ma wax ka qaban doonaa?.
Give me a little.	Wax yar i sii.
He seems to be everywhere today.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa in uu maanta meel walba joogo.
It is unthinkable.	Waa wax aan la malayn karin.
But it may not be.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
They won't even see it.	Xitaa ma arki doonaan.
There was something else.	Wax kale ayaa jiray.
Another is why they are so popular.	Mid kale waa sababta ay u badan yihiin.
It didn't bother her.	Wax dhib ah kuma ay siin.
I have to help him.	Waa inaan caawiyo isaga.
They are not included.	Kuma jiraan.
There is something else as well.	Wax kale ayaa jira sidoo kale.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
It's so amazing.	Aad bay u yaab badan tahay.
Three is three.	Saddex waa saddex.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn kartid.
This was the least she could do.	Tani waxay ahayd waxa ugu yar ee ay samayn karto.
Mostly.	Inta badan.
This is not a required area.	Tani maaha meel loo baahan yahay.
It would be better now.	Hadda way fiicnaan lahayd.
This was every day, every time.	Tani waxay ahayd maalin kasta, wakhti kasta.
Well done and very solid.	Si fiican loo sameeyay oo aad u adag.
They should do nothing.	Waa in aanay waxba samayn.
Not yet.	Wali maaha .
So, there may be something interesting about them.	Marka, waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax xiiso leh oo ka mid ah.
I don’t always do it.	Mar walba ma sameeyo.
It can be but not always.	Waxay noqon kartaa laakiin had iyo jeer maaha.
I did not.	Anigu ma aan samayn.
.	.
In fact, you do not need to.	Dhab ahaantii, uma baahnid.
I wanted to stay.	Waxaan rabay inaan joogo.
It was close.	Waxay ahayd wax dhow.
It just won’t happen.	Kaliya ma dhici doonto.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
A few things are coming up.	Waxyaabo dhowr ah ayaa soo socda.
He lied.	Been buu u sheegay.
But very good.	Laakiin aad u fiican.
It was a big strike.	Waxay ahayd shaqo joojin weyn.
And one by one it was rejected.	Oo mid mid ayaa loo diiday.
She already has.	Waxay hore u leedahay.
Nothing now.	Wax hadda ma jiraan.
I can't say who.	Ma sheegi karo cidda.
It must be helped	Waa in la caawiyo
I'll do it there	Waxaan ku samayn doonaa halkaas
I was in school.	Waxaan ahaa dugsiga.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u dheer ka hor.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah ma leh.
Not true.	Run maaha.
It took something, for sure.	Wax bay ka qaaday, hubaal.
But here is the place.	Laakiin halkan waa meesha.
Only you know that today.	Kaliya taas maanta ogaatay.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
I didn’t understand this, even a little bit.	Ma fahmin tan, xitaa in yar.
It's hard not to like that.	Way adag tahay inaan sidaas jeclayn.
Wow it is.	Waa waa waa.
I can't do that now.	Taas hadda ma awoodo.
Very hard to find here, too.	Aad u adag oo aad ka heli karto halkan, sidoo kale.
Maybe today more than ever.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in maanta in ka badan sidii hore.
That is better.	Taasi way ka fiican tahay.
They are good to do.	Way fiican yihiin inay sameeyaan.
I know how hard it is here.	Waan ogahay sida ay u adag tahay halkan.
You are better than us.	Waad naga fiican tahay.
He once tried that.	Mar ayuu isku dayay taas.
They are the same.	Waxay la mid yihiin.
Here is how you will do it	Waa kan sida aad u samayn doonto
But you need to know what you are doing.	Laakiin waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxaad samaynayso.
I'll talk about it another day.	Maalin kale ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
Good for him.	Isaga u fiican.
Take your time, there is no urgency.	Waqti qaado, degdeg ma jiro.
She would have had one chance.	Waxay heli lahayd hal fursad.
Someone might be able to help me, he thought.	Qof laga yaabo inuu i caawin karo, ayuu u maleeyay.
He has not yet spoken.	Weli ma uusan hadlin.
I have to find a man.	Waa in aan ku helo nin.
He doesn't have to work anymore.	Ma aha inuu sii shaqeeyo.
She would do it now.	Hadda way samayn lahayd.
Certainly not that.	Hubaal taasi ma noqon karto.
I think she would say that.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas odhan lahayd.
But it does not have to be done anymore.	Laakiin ma aha in mar dambe la sameeyo.
He just does.	Kaliya wuu sameeyaa .
She has a job	Waxay leedahay shaqo
He spent enough time.	Wuxuu ku qaatay waqti ku filan.
But it was so beautiful.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
Lots to see.	Wax badan la arkay.
He picked it up and left.	Wuu soo qaaday oo ka baxay.
We give you something that is not the best.	Waxaan ku siin wax aan ahayn waxa ugu fiican.
He came out.	Wuu soo baxay.
It is not.	Ma ahan .
I always thought it would be me.	Had iyo jeer waxaan u maleynayay inay aniga ahaan doonto.
But it really can’t be surprising.	Laakiin run ahaantii la yaab ma noqon karto.
Really looked.	Runtii eegay.
Otherwise he had a very, very good day.	Haddii kale wuxuu lahaa maalin aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
I love you so much	aad baan kuu jeclahay
I am really happy about that.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
For me, it was a busy time.	Aniga, waxa ay ii ahayd wakhti mashquul badan.
He can love it like no other.	Wuxuu u jeclaan karaa sida qof kale.
Everything in it.	Wax kasta oo ku jira.
It wouldn’t be great.	Ma ahaan lahayd mid weyn.
He knows where she is going.	Meesha ay aaday wuu garanayaa.
We can't do it again.	Mar kale ma samayn karno.
She did not want to.	Ma ay rabin.
She should not have done this.	Ma ahayn inay tan samayso.
But you lied to me.	Laakiin been baad ii sheegtay.
Then, he said he probably knew.	Ka dib, wuxuu yidhi malaha wuu ogaa.
There are enough things to do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo ku filan oo la sameeyo.
You are this.	Waxaad tahay kan.
I actually once asked someone.	Runtii mar ayaan qof wax ka waydiiyay.
There were other things to do.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo la sameeyo.
That's no problem.	Taasi dhib malaha.
He was not a close friend.	Ma ahayn saaxiib dhow.
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
I just saw this.	Kaliya waan arkay tan.
That's all right now.	Taasi waa dhan hadda.
That’s what she wants me to know.	Taasi waa waxa ay rabto in aan ogaado.
They will certainly do it.	Waa hubaal inay yeeli doonaan.
Still, it felt a bit long.	Weli, waxa la dareemay xoogaa dheer.
Anything can be done, today.	Wax walba waa la samayn karaa, maanta.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
I would really like.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa runtii.
Give it another chance.	Fursad kale sii.
He can stay wherever he wants.	Meesha uu doono ayuu joogi karaa.
It is a big lie.	Waa been weyn.
We are even.	Waxaan nahay xitaa.
But you may not want this.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan rabin tan.
me? 	aniga?
I have something	Wax baan hayaa
We need it urgently.	Waxaan u baahanahay si degdeg ah.
I know there is nothing there.	Waan ogahay in aysan meesha waxba ka jirin.
I did the same thing once.	Waxaan sameeyay wax la mid ah hal mar.
More that you will not get.	In badan oo aadan heli doonin.
Can someone please help me?	Qof fadlan ma i caawin karaa.
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
I'm sorry it took too long.	Waan ka xumahay waqti badan ayaa la qaatay.
I need something	wax baan u baahanahay
It should not be found.	Waa in aan la helin.
No one said much.	Qofna wax badan oo uu sheego ma jirin.
You did not want me.	Ma aadan rabin inaan.
And looked at each other.	Oo la is eegay.
For me, it was.	Aniga ahaan, waxay ahayd.
He asked for help.	Waxa uu codsaday in la caawiyo.
You can not.	Ma kartaa .
I have been regular for up to a year.	Aniga oo joogto ah ilaa hal sano.
He felt, he still felt.	Wuu dareemay, wali wuu dareemay.
Which you do.	Taas oo aad samaynayso.
I wanted it to be even harder.	Waxa aan rabay in ay taasi ka sii adag tahay.
That has been badly said.	Taas ayaa si xun loo sheegay.
It would be loved.	Waa la jeclaan lahaa.
.	.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
That will be.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa.
I couldn't catch you	Waan ku qaban waayay
Now I know he doesn't like me.	Hadda waan ogahay inuusan i jeclayn.
I am a car man, not a money man.	Waxaan ahay nin baabuur ah, ma aha nin lacag ah.
There was no urgency to take it.	Ma jirin degdeg in loo qaado.
I never did that.	Weligay ma aan samayn taas.
More, more.	Wax badan, ka badan.
It has been heard.	Waa la maqlay.
I am here	waan joogaa
You can help me here.	Waxaad iga caawin kartaa halkan.
He saw what he saw.	Wuu arkay wuxuu arkay.
I will tell you.	waan kuu sheegi doonaa.
He looked at the rest.	Inta kale ayuu eegay.
It will be very good.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u fiican.
To be seen no more.	Si aan mar dambe loo arag.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Kaliya sidaas uma shaqeeyo.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
That is one day.	Taasi waa hal maalin.
I entered.	waan galay.
I hold you	waan ku hayaa
Maybe there is something he can do.	Malaha waxaa jira wax uu samayn karo.
It was really right.	Runtii sax bay ahayd.
I did.	waan sameeyay.
He will help us.	Wuu naga caawin doonaa.
Everyone knew and no one did anything.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa oo qofna waxba ma samayn.
Somehow, that was surprising.	Si ahaan, taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
He still couldn't believe it, but it was true.	Weli wuu rumaysan waayay, laakiin run bay ahayd.
You did it on time.	Waxaad ku samaysay waqti.
She said she has.	Waxay sheegtay inay leedahay.
He knew they didn't have to.	Wuu ogaa in aanay lahayn.
It would be good for you.	Way kuu fiicnaan lahayd.
I have some work to do.	Waxaan hayaa xoogaa shaqo ah.
I do not understand .	ma fahmin .
It seems that this is not going to be difficult.	Waxay u egtahay in tani aysan noqon mid adag.
I want the right one.	Waxaan rabaa mid sax ah.
This must be done.	Tani waa in la sameeyaa.
Just fast.	Kaliya degdeg ah.
Why.	Waa maxay sababta .
He saw that before.	Taas wuu sii arkay.
I would love to be one	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mid noqdo
And he will do so.	Oo sidaas wuu yeeli doonaa.
I can't even speak.	Xitaa ma hadli karo.
It really doesn't matter.	Runtii waxba maaha.
It looks even more amazing.	Waxay u egtahay mid ka sii yaab badan.
Someone left here.	Qof baa halkan uga tagay.
I think we do.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan samayno.
He is not here now.	Hadda ma joogo halkan.
I say now.	Waxaan leeyahay hadda.
They are really good.	Runtii aad bay u wanaagsan yihiin.
There was a lot of them.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo ka mid ah.
It has to be good.	Waa inay wanaagsan tahay.
I can tell you now.	Waan kuu sheegi karaa hadda.
They may not have a car.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay baabuur haysan.
Less would be more.	In ka yar ayaa ka badan lahaa.
Not so.	Wax sidaas ah maaha.
No problem, we would get it.	Dhib malaha, waan heli lahayn.
But it is very similar.	Laakiin aad bay isku mid tahay.
I was three.	Saddex ayaan ahaa saddex.
You did it again.	Mar kale ayaad samaysay.
Everyone should go home now.	Qof kastaa hadda waa inuu guriga aado.
I refused as always.	Waan diiday sidii had iyo jeer.
The most would be tomorrow.	Waxa ugu badan ayaa noqon lahaa berrito.
We are still friends.	Wali waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
Certainly now.	Waa hubaal hadda.
I couldn't even speak.	Xitaa ma hadli karin.
And now is a good time.	Oo hadda waa wakhti fiican.
Still, it wasn’t too bad.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
Not so great.	Ma aha sidaas u weyn.
I know it all.	Waan ogahay dhammaan.
She says that's good.	Waxay tidhi taasi way wanaagsan tahay.
I am happy to know that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan taas ogaado.
That can be a very long time.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa waqti aad u dheer.
But it was also amazing.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay ahayd yaab.
You have to be a big man.	Waa inaad tahay nin weyn.
It took a lot.	Wax badan buu qaatay.
Not often.	Inta badan ma aha.
Maybe again.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in mar kale.
There is nothing else you can do here.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo aad halkan ku samayn karto.
A new one came out today.	Mid cusub ayaa maanta soo baxay.
I don't like him.	Ma jecli isaga.
No one came.	Qofna ma iman.
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
It can also be a big problem.	Waxa kale oo laga yaabaa inay tahay dhibaato weyn.
you said.	waxaad tidhi .
I don't know for sure.	Ma garanayo hubaal.
I always saw it.	Mar walba waan arki jiray.
But as mentioned earlier, it also cannot be.	Laakiin sidii hore loo sheegay, sidoo kale ma noqon karto.
There was some truth to this.	Waxaa jiray xoogaa run ah tan.
He does what he wants to do.	Wuxuu sameeyaa wuxuu rabo inuu sameeyo.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka sii badan.
You can one day be good and one bad.	Maalin ayaad noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan iyo mid xun.
There was something familiar.	Wax la yaqaan ayaa ka jiray.
New white door.	Albaabka cad ee cusub.
Maybe it's good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wanaagsan tahay.
I was lucky	nasiib ayaan lahaa
He has very little intelligence.	Waxa uu leeyahay caqli aad u yar.
He didn’t get to do that.	Ma uusan helin inuu taas sameeyo.
One is.	Mid waa .
They really do.	Runtii way sameeyaan.
They probably don't do anything about it.	Waxay u badan tahay in aanay waxba ka qaban.
But that was a short time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wax yar ka hor.
A lot of surprises.	Wax badan oo la yaab leh.
But not anymore.	Laakiin mar dambe maaha.
Very difficult, but not like us.	Aad u adag, laakiin nala mid ma aha.
I have never seen that.	Weligay taas ma arag.
I saw what happened	Waxaan arkay waxa dhacay
Everything is correct and really exists.	Wax kastaa waa sax oo runtii waa jira.
He's still gone.	Weli wuu baxay.
I was a lot.	Waxaan ahaa wax badan.
She still had.	Wali way lahayd.
And only you can see.	Oo kaliya waad arki kartaa.
He wanted to help.	Wuxuu rabay inuu caawiyo.
I always came here.	Had iyo jeer halkan ayaan iman jiray.
Now I have heard.	Hadda ayaan maqlay.
It must have taken a lot of time and money.	Waa inuu qaatay waqti iyo lacag badan.
It's a lot.	Way badan tahay.
But still.	Laakiin weli.
He thought he would do a great job.	Wuxuu mooday inuu shaqo weyn qaban doono.
It was an opportunity.	Waxay ahayd fursad.
I didn't have time for this.	Waqti uma helin tan.
He has very little.	Waxa uu leeyahay wax aad u yar .
But well.	Laakiin si fiican.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
I am very sorry about this.	Aad baan uga xumahay tan.
There is nowhere to go.	Meel laga helo ma jirto.
That is good.	Taasi waa wanaagsan tahay.
It is always there.	Had iyo jeer waa halkaas.
And this is now done.	Oo tan hadda waa la sameeyay.
It really is still.	Dhab ahaantii waa weli.
You were.	Waxaad ahayd .
Maybe I won't have time.	Malaha wakhti ma heli doono.
You must be happy.	Waa inaad faraxsan tahay.
I'm really sorry for him.	Runtii waan ka xumahay isaga.
I think that is still the case.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi weli tahay waxa jira.
Now she had him.	Hadda way lahayd isaga.
You will see if that is the case.	Waad arki doontaa haddii ay taasi sidaas tahay.
We were busy.	Waxaan ahayn mashquul.
You must not be present.	Waa inaadan joogin.
Not true.	Run maaha.
He was robbed.	Wuu la dhacay.
That can actually happen here.	Taasi dhab ahaantii way dhici kartaa halkan.
But he was like a captive man.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa sidii nin la haysto.
They are happy.	Way ku faraxsan yihiin.
Something clearly known.	Wax si cad loo yaqaan.
he found himself.	wuu is helay .
I saw you.	waan ku arkay.
I want to do everything with you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba kula sameeyo.
What else can you say, really ?.	Maxaa kale oo aad odhan kartaa, runtii?.
They may not get it back.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay dib u helin.
You just can't go.	Kaliya ma aadi kartid .
He likes to talk.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu hadlo.
She wish she was.	Waxay jeclaan lahayd inay ahayd.
This is a little difficult, but it is really interesting.	Tani waa dhib yar, laakiin runtii waa mid xiiso leh.
He is just a man.	Waa nin kaliya.
I never thought of that.	Weligay uma malaynayn taas.
And very big.	Oo aad u weyn.
He told me.	Ayuu ii sheegay.
I don’t know why anyone would do that.	Ma garanayo sababta uu qof u samayn lahaa taas.
It was good too.	Wax fiican ayuu sidoo kale ahaa.
I don't like this.	Ma jecli tan.
I did not find another job.	Shaqo kale maan helin.
There is not much going on.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo socda.
But going well.	Laakiin si fiican u socda.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan baa dhacay.
She said we are good food.	Waxay tidhi waxaan nahay cunto wanaagsan.
But it can take time.	Laakiin waxay qaadan kartaa waqti.
I'm sorry about what happened.	Waan ka xumahay wixii dhacay.
He doesn't seem to be able to help.	Uma eka in uu ku caawin karo.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegi jirin.
I can do anything for everyone.	Wax walba waan u samayn karaa qof walba.
He should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inuu si fiican u ogaado.
As I have seen before.	Sidii hore ayaan u arkay.
It would be a bit.	Waxay noqon lahayd xoogaa.
That was done.	Taas waa la sameeyay.
I have never done anything like this.	Weligay wax sidaas oo kale ah weligay ma aan samayn.
I really can't speak right now.	Runtii hadda ma hadli karo.
That's what he felt.	Taasi waa waxa uu dareemay.
I would love to do it, only once.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo, kaliya hal mar.
He said he was fine.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu ku fiican yahay.
But that can take time.	Laakiin taasi waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
I want to do it tonight	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo caawa
Today this is unpopular.	Maanta tani waa mid aan la jeclayn.
I have to get another one.	Waa inaan mid kale helo.
Certainly it was.	Hubaal waxay ahayd.
But a lot is going on.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa socda.
You can find nothing in it.	Waxba waad ka heli kartaa.
This is not very difficult.	Tani ma aha mid aad u adag.
It can be a lot more.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax badan oo kale.
If you need to do this, you will.	Haddii aad u baahan tahay inaad tan samayso, waad samayn doontaa.
He will take you here today.	Maanta ayuu halkan ku qaadan doonaa.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii cad.
Arrive once.	Yimid hal mar.
I still do.	Weli waan sameeyaa.
There is beauty available.	Waxaa jira qurux badan oo la heli karo.
Lies, lies and lies.	Been, been iyo been badan.
He has been around for almost three years.	Waxa uu ku dhow yahay saddex sano oo dhan.
But I will not stay.	Laakiin ma joogi doono.
You know this is untrue.	Waxaad ogtahay in tani ay tahay mid aan run ahayn.
And entered.	Oo soo galay.
So he said.	Sidaas ayuu yidhi.
I went hard.	Waxaan u baxay si adag.
He could not take it anymore.	Mar dambe wuu qaadan waayay.
So it would all be.	Sidaas oo dhan lahaa.
That was all he did, but it was enough.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu sameeyay oo dhan, laakiin waa ku filan tahay.
I can help you, you know.	Waan ku caawin karaa, waad ogtahay.
I just want you home.	Kaliya waxaan kaa rabaa guriga.
Not the same big.	Ma aha mid isla weyn.
He looks happy.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan.
I was very tough.	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u adag.
There really is no time.	Runtii waqti ma jiro.
He can do whatever he wants.	Waxa uu doono ayuu ku samayn karaa.
I found another car.	Waxaan helay baabuur kale.
She should have been here now.	Waxay ahayd inay halkan joogto hadda.
You are like him.	Waxaad la mid tahay isaga oo kale.
He would leave nothing.	Waxba wuu ka tagi lahaa.
I would not do that.	Anigu sidaas uma yeeli lahayn.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
That was not all he did.	Taasi ma ahayn waxa uu sameeyay oo dhan.
I would like to know how to do this.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado sida tan loo sameeyo.
Just like me.	Si la mid ah aniga.
It is still done.	Weli waa loo sameeyay.
It didn't matter if she was ready or not.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn inay diyaar u tahay iyo in kale.
It was, but there was more.	Waxay ahayd, laakiin waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
I think it was money	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd lacag
I think she has that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi leedahay.
He can do it very hard.	Wuxuu u samayn karaa si aad u adag.
It is always here for you.	Had iyo jeer waa halkan adiga.
I wanted to know why.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sababta.
But maybe she will.	Laakiin malaha way yeeli doontaa.
New thing	Wax cusub
I got good money	Lacag fiican ayaan helay
It's not pretty.	Ma qurux badna.
That was a little weird.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax yar oo yaab leh.
And it happened.	Oo ku dhacay.
He was a great friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib aad u badan.
He loves you so much, you know.	Aad buu kuu jecel yahay, waad ogtahay.
Tomorrow is you.	Berrito waa adiga.
Bad, bad, bad.	Xun, xun, xun.
It's too long	Aad bay u dheer tahay
I can't imagine this.	Ma malayn karo tan.
I felt at home with you.	Waxaan dareemay inaan guriga kula joogo.
I didn’t come out, you know.	Maan soo bixin, waad ogtahay.
It will surely happen whatever you do.	Runtii way dhici doontaa wax kasta oo aad samayso.
I still didn't like it.	Wali ma jeclayn.
But it was not fun.	Laakiin ma uusan ahayn mid xiiso leh.
It's you.	Waa adiga.
And, of course, she had.	Oo, runtii, waxay lahayd.
He said that was correct.	Wuxuu sheegay in taasi sax tahay.
That's how it feels to me.	Taasi waa sida ay aniga ila tahay.
But they did not like it all.	Laakiin ma ay jeclayn dadka wada.
No problem.	Dhib maaha.
Probably him, too.	Waxay u badan tahay isaga, sidoo kale.
I think it is beautiful.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay qurux badan tahay.
I have never found one.	Weligay mid maan helin.
He did not want to leave.	Ma uusan rabin inuu baxo.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
I suspect they often do.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay inta badan sameeyaan.
This will be hard work.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa shaqo adag.
She can't cook anything else.	Wax kale ma karin karto.
It looks real.	Waxay u egtahay mid dhab ah.
I became someone else.	Waxaan noqday qof kale.
It’s so big here.	Aad bay u weyn tahay halkan.
He couldn't take it to be beautiful.	Wuxuu u qaadan waayay inay qurux badan tahay.
I am very serious.	Aad ayaan dhab u ahay.
He refused to speak.	Wuu diiday inuu hadlo.
You think you can do whatever you want.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inaad samayn karto waxaad doonto.
Take time to do other things.	Waqti ku bixi inaad sameyso waxyaabo kale.
I never did this again.	Mar dambe tan ma samayn.
I think it's tough.	Waxaan filayaa inuu adag yahay.
I was as always before.	Waxaan ahaa sida had iyo jeer hore.
Everyone is gone.	Qof walba wuu baxay.
He pretended not to know me.	Waxa uu iska dhigay in aanu i garanayn.
It looks like me.	Waxay u egtahay aniga.
I really wanted to talk to you.	Waxaan aad u rabay inaan kula hadlo.
He said I want to see you.	Wuxuu yiri waxaan rabaa inaan ku arko.
It is needed.	Waa loo baahan yahay.
It can be really good.	Waxay noqon kartaa runtii wanaagsan.
Took a small meal.	Qaaday cunto yar.
That can pay off as well.	Taasi waxay bixin kartaa sidoo kale.
Very, very interesting to me.	Aad iyo aad ii xiiso badan.
She found out again that someone was in trouble.	Waxay mar kale ogaatay qof dhib ku jiro.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin tani maaha.
But he was in for a bit.	Laakiin wuxuu ku jiray xoogaa yar.
But he could not do that.	Laakiin taas ma uu samayn karin.
Too many, friend.	Aad bay u badan yihiin, saaxiib.
Don't tell me anything.	Waxba ha ii sheegin.
No matter what it is.	Dhib malaha waxa ay tahay.
He used to do that.	Taas wuu samayn jiray.
I'll take you here.	Waxaan ku qaadan doonaa halkan.
That is bigger.	Taasi waa ka sii weyn tahay.
It may be correct.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay noqon karto mid sax ah.
Really, really bad.	Runtii, runtii aad u xun.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
He was three.	Saddex ayuu ahaa.
It's good.	Waa mid wanaagsan.
I know you can do better.	Waan ogahay inaad wax ka fiican samayn karto.
She had no food.	Wax cunto ah uma ay lahayn.
Everything will be over soon.	Wax walba way dhammaan doontaa dhawaan.
What's up with that.	Maxaa ka jira taas.
was he there ?.	miyuu joogay?.
They are almost identical.	Waxay ku dhow yihiin isku mid.
That is why it is good.	Taasi waa sababta ay u fiican tahay.
Maybe now, it will really take a while.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in hadda, ay si dhab ah u qaadan doonto sababta.
He’s not an intruder, either.	Ma aha qof soo galay, sidaas oo kale.
Often this is better.	Inta badan tan ayaa ka fiican.
She had a place to stay.	Waxay lahayd meel ay joogto.
Probably no one like him.	Malaha mid isaga la mid ah ma jiro.
He wanted to stay with everything.	Waxa uu rabay in uu sii joogo wax walba.
She had to stay.	Waxay ahayd inay joogto.
I can't believe it.	Ma rumaysan karo.
It was all over me.	Waxay ahayd aniga oo dhan.
Definitely for me.	Waa hubaal aniga.
This is really a bad idea.	Runtii tani waa fikrad xun.
We can't go back.	Dib uma noqon karno.
I go.	waan tagi.
You did not do this.	Tani ma aadan samayn.
But it will, after all.	Laakiin way yeeli doontaa, ka dib.
Whenever that would be.	Mar kasta oo ay taasi ahaan lahayd.
It is better not to leave.	Waxaa fiican inaadan ka tagin.
There should be enough food for everyone.	Waa in ay cunto ku filan qof walba.
I need a lot of money.	Waxaan u baahanahay lacag aad iyo aad u badan.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
He really did.	Runtii taas wuu sameeyay.
There really is a lot.	Runtii wax badan baa jira.
He was here.	Wuu joogay halkan.
Every day, really.	Maalin kasta, dhab ahaantii.
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan run ahayn .
He does little.	Wax yar ayuu sameeyaa.
But that is.	Laakiin taasi waa.
He took it, but surprisingly.	Wuu qaatay, laakiin si yaab leh.
You will see.	Waad arki doontaa.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
He didn’t have that.	Ma uusan haysan taas.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
Let me tell you another.	Mid kale aan kuu sheego.
We would be lucky.	Waxaan noqon lahayn nasiib.
That was true, so far.	Taasi run bay ahayd, ilaa hadda.
No one will believe you.	Qofna kuma rumaysan doono.
I know they will love it.	Waan ogahay inay jeclaan doonaan.
This may be true of other things.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa run waxyaabo kale.
I got nothing.	Waxba ma helin.
I always wanted one.	Mar walba mid baan rabay.
I still made good money but nowhere near that.	Weli waxaan sameeyay lacag fiican laakiin meel u dhow ma jirto.
If, as he said.	Haddii, sida uu sheegay.
Definitely good friends.	Dhab ahaantii saaxiibo wanaagsan.
They will get it too.	Way heli doonaan sidoo kale.
Not today, but soon.	Maanta maaha, laakiin dhawaan.
That sounds like a lot.	Taasi waxay u egtahay wax badan.
All by chance.	Dhammaan si nasiib ah.
It was given to me.	Waa la i siiyay.
She should do the same.	Waa inay sidaas oo kale samayso.
It is being debated.	Waa la isku hayaa.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u fiican tahay.
Only you and I are there.	Aniga iyo adiga kaliya ayaa jira.
It was seen tonight.	Waa lagu arkay caawa.
Only the best people.	Kaliya dadka ugu fiican.
That’s the only thing you can do, friend.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya oo aad sameyn karto, saaxiib.
You just said that.	Kaliya sidaas ayaad sheegtay.
I really like it now.	Runtii waan jeclahay hadda.
You do not have to do this.	Ma aha inaad tan sameyso.
This could be.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa.
He does.	Wuu sameeyaa .
I'm not sure he really wants to be there.	Ma hubo inuu runtii rabo inuu halkaas joogo.
Obviously, everyone does.	Sida cad, qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
You will for sure.	Waxaad hubaal ahaan doontaa.
He will stay there again.	Halkaas ayuu mar kale sii joogi doonaa.
He had a long career ahead of him.	Waxa uu lahaa shaqo dheer oo isaga ka hor.
I couldn't do that.	Taas waxba kama qaban karin.
They are difficult.	Way ku adag yihiin.
And you will be.	Oo waxaad noqon doontaa.
For a while.	In muddo ah.
That is new to me.	Taasi waa igu cusub.
They will get better.	Way fiicnaan doonaan.
I had a long day.	Maalin dheer baan lahaa.
Until she lost.	Ilaa ay wayday.
He received no other money.	Lacag kale ma uu helin.
He didn't like to talk about it.	Ma uu jeclayn in uu ka hadlo.
But it was true.	Laakiin run bay ahayd.
Certainly, indeed.	Hubaal in, dhab ahaantii.
It is as good as it is now.	Aad bay u fiican tahay sida ay hadda tahay.
You are so good to help me.	Aad baad u fiican tahay inaad i caawiso.
I know what to expect.	Waan ogahay waxa aan filan karo.
I am unemployed.	Waxaan ahay shaqo la'aan.
There are similar things going on.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo isku mid ah oo socda.
I will stop.	Waan joojin doonaa.
That is why you are here.	Taasi waa sababta aad halkan u joogto.
You may be lucky.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad nasiib leedahay.
was he.	miyuu ahaa .
So much out there.	Aad u badan oo halkaas.
He must not have seen it that way.	Ma aha in uu waligiis sidaas u arkay.
You can be with me for that.	Waad ila ahaan kartaa taas.
You are less than nothing.	Waxaad ka yar tahay waxba.
There were several others.	Waxaa jiray dhowr qof oo kale.
That, too, was a surprise.	Taasi, sidoo kale, waxay ahayd yaab.
Maybe he would like to get to know you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu jeclaan lahaa inuu ku barto.
I usually get nothing.	Inta badan waxba ma helo.
It is feared.	Waa laga baqayaa.
He had never seen anything like it before.	Hadda ka hor ma uusan arag wax la mid ah.
Faster, faster worse.	Si degdeg ah u dhacay, si degdeg ah u xun.
Everyone else said the same.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa sidaas oo kale yiri.
And what you did.	Iyo waxa aad samaysay.
He told me he would talk to her.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu la hadli doono.
That's when to leave.	Taasi waa markii la bixi lahaa.
What could it be? 	Maxay noqon kartaa?
Otherwise he would not believe us.	Haddii kale wuu na rumaysan waayay.
It had nothing to do with this.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn arrintan.
Now I have to go to work	Hadda waa inaan shaqada aado
It was time to get closer now.	Waxay ahayd markii la isku soo dhawaan lahaa hadda.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
It was new.	Waxay ahayd cusub.
.	.
I'm sorry, you say.	Waan ka xumahay, waxaad leedahay.
That is ready to go.	Taasi waa diyaar in la tago.
That is not a long truth.	Taasi run dheer maaha.
Please do not misunderstand me.	Fadlan ha i fahmin.
Boston has something similar.	Boston waxay leedahay wax la mid ah.
You will definitely take it that way.	Waxaad si dhab ah u qaadan doontaa sidaas.
Bad old stuff.	Waxyaabo hore oo xun.
I have the truth.	run baan ku hayaa.
She could no longer see.	Wax dambe ma ay arki karin.
Maybe this was the same thing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay ahayd wax la mid ah.
She likes to tell him.	Waxay jeceshahay inay isaga u sheegto.
This is really amazing again.	Tani runtii mar kale waa yaab.
That’s really, really, all there is to it.	Taasi waa run ahaantii, runtii, waxa jira oo dhan.
This was done yesterday.	Tan shalay la sameeyay.
Everything is fine now.	Wax walba hadda way fiican yihiin.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
It's new.	Waa cusub ayaa soo baxay.
Only food is all.	Cunto kaliya waa dhammaan.
He said he was sorry.	Wuxuu yidhi waan ka xumahay.
I say it is enough.	Waxaan leeyahay waa ku filan tahay.
You can talk.	Waad hadli kartaa.
Nothing will happen to you.	Waxba kugu dhici maayo.
it is not wise.	caqli ma aha.
You are what you are.	Waxaad tahay waxa aad tahay.
He left.	Wuu baxay.
There is no way they can not.	Ma jirto si aysan u awoodin.
It will happen over time.	Waqti ka dib way dhici doontaa.
I need to.	waxaan u baahanahay inaan .
There he saw something.	Halkaas ayuu wax ku arkay.
He looked at something else.	Wax kale ayuu eegay.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
There is so much to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo.
It is now available	Hadda waa la heli karaa
There really isn’t much you can do.	Runtii wax badan oo aadan sameyn karin ma jiraan.
Everything was fine.	Wax kasta oo ay ahayd dhib ma lahayn.
Do not leave it alone.	Keligaa ha ka tagin.
Maybe somewhat true of that.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xoogaa run ah taas.
I didn’t even know they were doing that.	Xitaa ma aan ogayn inay sidaas sameeyaan.
It's harder than that.	Way ka adag tahay taas.
I had a good time with him.	Waqti fiican ayaan la qaatay isaga.
It's beautiful.	Waa qurux.
I know he is happy.	Waan ogahay inuu faraxsan yahay.
No one can see it.	Qofna ma arki karo.
There is no time now.	Waqti ma jiro hadda.
This really is.	Tani runtii waa .
This is not surprising to people.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh dadka.
You can do better than this.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax ka wanaagsan tan.
Obviously not.	Si cad maaha.
There was something in it.	Wax baa ku jiray.
I'm sorry for people like you.	Waan ka xumahay dadka adiga oo kale ah.
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
I felt it.	Waan dareemay.
Now, no one knows.	Hadda, qofna ma garanayo.
He knew how to get it.	Wuu ogaa sida loo helo.
And they certainly did not know him.	Oo hubaal ma ay garanayn isaga.
I think of him.	Waxaan u malaynayaa isaga.
She did something to you.	Wax bay ku samaysay.
It is a new day.	Waa maalin cusub.
I have to do this from time to time.	Waa inaan tan sameeyaa mar mar.
That is the worst thing you can do.	Taasi waa waxa ugu xun ee aad sameyn kartid.
If not, well that's fine, too.	Haddii aysan ahayn, si fiican taasi waa fiican tahay, sidoo kale.
I didn't like it.	Ma jeclayn.
In fact, it was huge.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
But still lucky.	Laakiin weli nasiib badan.
Everything is unnecessary.	Wax walba waa wax aan loo baahnayn.
Not only that.	Ma aha oo kaliya.
Couldn't come back.	Dib u soo noqon waayay.
I will stay with you as long as you need me.	Waan kula joogi doonaa inta aad ii baahan tahay.
Really, don’t take it for granted.	Runtii, ha u qaadan.
It was not a big deal.	Wax weyn ma ahayn.
That would be great.	Taasi aad bay u fiicnaan lahayd.
If he leaves, they will all return.	Haddii uu baxo, dhammaan way soo noqon doonaan.
We are more than that.	Waan ka badan nahay.
That's not how it works.	Taasi maaha sida uu u shaqeeyo.
I will take a chance	fursad ayaan qaadan doonaa
Give them what they need.	Sii waxay u baahan yihiin.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
We are out.	Waa nala baxay.
But he came alone.	Laakiin keligiis ayuu yimid.
Give it to everyone, now.	Sii qof walba, hadda.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
Surprisingly, really.	Si la yaab leh, dhab ahaantii.
It has to be done.	Waa in la sameeyaa.
New money is always.	Lacag cusub had iyo jeer waa.
He is a person.	Waa qof.
That would do.	Taasi waxay samayn lahayd.
No one.	Qofna ma jiro.
Very difficult	Aad u yara adag
Correct somewhat.	Sax xoogaa.
That was not what it was.	Taasi ma ahayn waxa ay ahayd.
I know that too.	Waan ogahay taas sidoo kale.
In fact, just don’t do it.	Dhab ahaantii, kaliya ha samayn.
That is not the same.	Taasi isku mid maaha.
Monday is not so bad.	Isniinta aad uma xun.
I had to be there.	Waxay ahayd inaan halkaas joogo.
I promised.	Waxaan u ballan qaaday.
I would do the same.	Waxaan samayn lahaa isla wax la mid ah.
Maybe they are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay yihiin.
But he never got it.	Laakiin waligiis ma helin.
He was very interesting.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
You can cancel at any time.	Waad joojin kartaa wakhti kasta.
Maybe, one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa, maalin.
She loves it there.	Way jeceshahay halkaas.
That's how bad it is.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun tahay.
I want him to be here.	Waxaan rabaa inuu halkaan joogo.
It was me.	Aniga ayuu ahaa.
I want to see what comes next	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko waxa soo socda
She no longer knew.	Mar dambe ma ay garanayn.
There was more.	Waxa meesha ku jiray in ka badan.
She did that, and very well.	Waxay samaysay taas, oo aad u fiican.
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
He will speak.	Wuu hadli doonaa.
I think it was me.	Waxaan filayaa inay aniga iga ahayd.
I thought you would never come back.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaadan soo noqon doonin.
I would rather go.	Waxaan ka fiicnaan lahayd inaan tago.
Mostly .	Inta badan .
She had a lot.	Wax badan bay lahayd.
What do you think.	Maxay aniga ila tahay.
It's been a long time.	Waa muddo dheer.
Everything is still.	Wax walba waa weli.
I can't do the latter.	Tan dambe ma samayn karo.
It’s probably going to be tough.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay mid adag.
Apparently, it was.	Sida cad, waxay ahayd.
I am very happy to have it.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay in aan haysto.
I have never told anyone that.	Weligay qofna sidaas uma sheegin.
She was beautiful.	Qurux bay lahayd.
No problem	Dhib ma rabo
There is a lot of time for that.	Waxaa jira waqti badan taas.
There is very little work.	Ma jiro shaqo aad u yar.
It is not, either.	Ma waa, sidoo kale.
But what was to be done was to be done.	Laakiin waxa ay ahayd in la sameeyo waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I do not want to go home	Ma rabo inaan guriga aado
He still wasn't.	Wali ma uusan ahayn.
Mostly not, but enough.	Inta badan ma aha, laakiin ku filan.
He did nothing.	Waxba kuma uu samayn.
I can't do anything about that.	Taas waxba kama qaban karo.
There was not much to do.	Wax badan oo la qaban lahaa ma jirin.
We can't leave.	Ma ka tagi karno.
He said they were not there.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay halkaas joogin.
I think that's good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi fiican tahay.
It can stay there.	Way joogi kartaa halkaas.
No one knows what they are.	Qofna ma garanayo waxay yihiin.
He would be there alone.	Keligiis ayuu halkaas ku noqon lahaa.
We are much the same.	In badan ayaan isku mid nahay.
I did not know what to do.	Waxa aan sameeyo ma garanayn.
It was a very difficult time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u dhib badan.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u wanaagsan yahay.
It’s a very, very bad thing.	Waa wax aad u xun oo xun.
This cannot be true.	Tani dhab ma noqon karto.
This is how she tells everyone she is three.	Tani waa sida ay qof walba ugu sheegto inay tahay saddex.
There was no other way.	Si kale ma jirin.
Something difficult.	Wax adag.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u fiican.
I was right there all the time.	Waxaan ahaa sax halkaas mar kasta.
Now to do this.	Hadda si arrintan loo sameeyo.
It’s a lot of time.	Waa waqti aad u badan.
You think he did nothing.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa in aanu waxba samayn.
Tomorrow will be very clear.	Berrito waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u cad.
It's like a busy time.	Waxay la mid tahay waqti mashquul badan.
That is not what happened.	Taasi maaha waxa dhacay.
I hope this will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay caawin doonto.
Everyone was amazed.	Qof kastaa aad buu ula yaabay.
But one could not get everything.	Laakiin mid wax walba ma heli karin.
He should have left early.	Waxay ahayd inuu goor hore baxo.
I will never be the same.	Weligay isku mid ahaan maayo.
I want them to stay that way.	Waxaan rabaa inay sidaas ku sii jiraan.
This is a well-taken time.	Tani waa waqti si fiican loo qaatay.
I'm not sure.	Ma hubo tan.
She still has little to do.	Weli waxay leedahay wax yar oo ay qaban karto.
Very busy.	Mashquul badan .
It wasn’t that big.	Ma ahayn mid sidaas u weyn.
But he wanted more.	Laakiin wax ka badan ayuu rabay.
Ideally, you would like.	Fikrad ahaan, waad jeclaan lahayd.
That is probably too much.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay aad u badan tahay.
I want you to know it is me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato inay aniga tahay.
you are like me.	waxaad tahay aniga oo kale.
It was clearly done.	Si cad ayaa loo sameeyay.
But this is a new time.	Laakiin tani waa waqti cusub.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inay ogaato.
This was a good thing and a bad thing.	Tani waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan oo xun.
It was not too difficult.	Ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
And very good.	Oo mid aad u fiican.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
I just want to be left alone.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa in la iga tago.
He does not have to leave.	Ma aha inuu baxo.
No one knew anything right.	Qofna ma ogayn wax sax ah.
It never was.	Waligiis ma ahayn.
He really didn't know.	Runtii ma uu ogayn.
It is often uncertain.	Inta badan lama hubo.
He is not a bad man.	Nin xun maaha.
It was right.	Waxay ahayd mid sax ah.
It will come out	Way soo bixi doontaa
It was as beautiful as it could be.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan sida ay noqon karto.
At first several did.	Markii hore dhowr ayaa sameeyay.
It sounds complicated, but it really isn’t.	Waxay u egtahay mid adag, laakiin dhab ahaantii maaha.
He’s very good, really.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay, runtii.
I don't buy this.	Ma iibsado kan.
He got it all.	Wuu wada helay.
I took it from you.	Waan kaa soo qaatay.
That is exactly what happened.	Run ahaantii taasi waa wixii dhacay.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
It was definitely a busy place.	Hubaal waxay ahayd meel mashquul ah.
They will not separate.	Ma kala tagi doonaan .
He said he didn't have it, but maybe.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu haysan, laakiin laga yaabo.
I know how this will end, you think.	Waan ogahay sida tani ku dhammaan doonto, waxaad u malaynaysaa.
Maybe he is.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu yahay.
But now he would not stop.	Laakiin hadda ma uu joojin lahaa.
You are too small.	Aad baad u yar tahay.
There is no time now.	Waqti ma jiro hadda.
It is difficult to know.	Way adag tahay in la ogaado.
I can tell from there.	Waxaan ka sheegi karaa halkaas.
But it was real.	Laakiin dhab bay ahayd.
I'm sorry for him, most of the time.	Waan ka xumahay isaga, inta badan.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I'm sure he's a tough guy.	Waxaan hubaa inuu yahay nin adag.
It wasn’t permanent, but it was permanent enough.	Ma ahayn joogto, laakiin waxay ahayd mid joogto ah oo ku filan.
I wouldn’t stop.	Ma joojin lahaa.
Maybe there is something true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jirto wax run ah.
But she was not ready.	Laakiin diyaar uma ahayn.
Bad, bad.	Wax xun, wax xun.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin.
You alone.	Adiga keligaa.
She doesn't think she needs to.	Ma aha in ay la tahay in ay u baahan tahay.
But there had to be something.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inay wax jiraan.
It's hard to come back.	Way adag tahay in laga soo noqdo.
I was with him.	Waan la joogay.
I guess no one does.	Waxaan filayaa in qofna uusan samayn.
And here you also need to know.	Oo halkan waxa kale oo aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
They may not last long !.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay muddo dheer joogin!.
It would be surprising and surprising if he did not.	Waxay noqon lahayd yaab iyo yaab haddii uusan samayn.
Almost everyone is.	Inta badan qof kasta waa.
It was a difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag.
It is good for you.	Adiga ayaa kuu fiican.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah malaha.
I didn't even have to be there.	Xitaa ma ahayn inaan halkaas joogo.
He did that, once.	Waxa uu sameeyay taas, hal mar.
But that's great if.	Laakiin taasi waa weyn haddii.
A little.	Wax yar leh .
She had a lot of promise.	Waxay lahayd ballan aad u badan.
One year	Hal sano
Don't take it for granted.	Ha u qaadan inuu wax xun ka sheego.
It is real.	Waa wax dhab ah.
We are separated.	Waa nala kala tagay.
As you can tell.	Sida aad sheegi karto.
And there was something else, too.	Oo waxaa jiray wax kale, sidoo kale.
She said I would talk to her again.	Waxay tidhi mar kale ayaan ila hadli doonaa.
They couldn’t have taken a better time.	Ma ay qaadan karin waqti ka wanaagsan.
You can't do it here	Halkan kuma samayn kartid
And here is where it is very interesting.	Oo halkan waa meesha ay aad u xiiso badan tahay.
You can come here whenever you want.	Waxaad iman kartaa halkan mar kasta oo aad rabto.
Everything happened here.	Wax kasta ayaa ka dhacay halkan.
No one else is alive.	Ma jiro qof kale oo nool.
You can't be a person, he thought.	Ma noqon kartaa qof, ayuu u maleeyay.
Will? 	Doona?
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
That was the first time.	Taasi waxay ahayd markii hore.
You can't do that.	Ma samayn kartid sidaas.
I am, as you well know, in need.	Waxaan ahay, sida aad si fiican u ogtahay, baahan.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
I could not do anything to prevent it.	Wax aan ka hor tago maan sameyn karin.
I did it now	hadda waan sameeyay
I found this here.	Tan waxaan ka helay halkan.
The rest is still good.	Inta kale weli way wanaagsan yihiin.
And good thing, too.	Iyo wax wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
That is probably a bad idea.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay fikrad xun.
There he was alone.	Halkaas ayuu keligiis ahaa.
What you told me was amazing.	Waxa aad ii sheegtay yaab.
I say he did.	Waxaan leeyahay wuu sameeyay.
I can't do this.	Ma samayn karo tan.
An existing one.	Mid hore u jiray.
Not only that, but you can do it quickly.	Ma aha oo kaliya, laakiin waxaad u samayn kartaa si degdeg ah.
I'm so sorry.	Aad baan ugu xumahay.
There is, now, not enough to do.	Ma jiro, hadda, ku filan in la sameeyo.
Nothing was said.	Waxba lama odhan.
But that is now.	Laakiin taasi waa hadda.
Sure, it's ready.	Hubaal, waa diyaar.
They may not be as smart as you are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan caqli u lahayn sida aad tahay.
That is you.	Taasi waa adiga.
Not much.	Wax badan kuma jiraan.
This is very new.	Tani waa mid aad u cusub.
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
I hope he is fine.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu fiican yahay.
I did it today.	maanta ayaan sameeyay.
Do not make any friends.	Wax saaxiibo ah ha samayn.
The same thing will happen here.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa halkan ka dhici doona.
As many times as you want.	Inta jeer ee aad rabto.
But he never came home.	Laakiin waligiis guriga ma iman.
Not exactly the same.	Dhab ahaantii isku mid maaha.
I'm sure it's home.	Waxaan hubaa inuu guriga yahay.
But really, it is not.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
That is probably true.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay run.
I will do everything to stay with you.	Wax walba waan samayn doonaa inaan kula joogo.
Which is also a great idea.	Taas oo sidoo kale ah fikrad aad u fiican.
But they had nothing to come.	Laakiin ma ay lahayn wax soo socda.
All very well.	Dhammaan aad u wanaagsan.
But this was not true.	Laakiin tani run ma ahayn.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
It has already happened.	Hore ayuu u dhacay.
I found this very, very strange.	Waxaan taas u arkay mid aad iyo aad u yaab badan.
She should know.	Waa inay ogaato.
If you are in it.	Haddii aad ku jirto.
He was a tough little guy.	Wuxuu ahaa nin yar oo adag.
I will love you, always.	Waan ku jeclaan doonaa, had iyo jeer.
I still have a lot to learn.	Weli wax badan oo aan barto ayaan hayaa.
That is not what you want to do.	Taasi maaha waxa aad rabto inaad sameyso.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
It's too bad you can't see that.	Waxaa aad u xun inaadan arki karin taas.
Otherwise it doesn't matter.	Haddii kale waxba maaha.
I hope it will happen.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici doonto.
We were once friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo mar.
Everyone who was supposed to be here was.	Qof kasta oo ay ahayd inuu halkan joogo ayaa ahaa.
You are the reason we do this.	Adiga ayaa ah sababta aan tan u samayno.
How would she do it.	Sidee bay yeeli lahayd .
I make good money.	Waxaan sameeyaa lacag fiican.
But you will do much better.	Laakiin waxaad samayn doontaa wax aad uga wanaagsan.
He has nothing else to fear from you.	Wax kale oo uu kaa baqayaa ma jiro.
I want what is best for you	Waxaan rabaa waxa kuu fiican
No one gets it right all the time.	Qofna si sax ah uma helo mar kasta.
To see you.	In aan ku arko.
Tom knew.	Tom wuu ogaa.
To a man.	Ku nin.
But that will happen.	Laakiin taasi way dhici doontaa.
I will definitely do this again.	Dhab ahaantii waan samayn doonaa tan mar kale.
It was no surprise.	Ma ahayn wax yaab leh.
No one really knows what happened.	Qofna ma garanayo runtii waxa dhacay.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
But no one wants that.	Laakiin qofna taas ma rabo.
But you have.	Laakiin waxaad leedahay.
I do not eat.	Ma cuno.
He looked a little.	Wax yar ayuu ka eegay.
First, it will not help.	Marka hore, ma caawin doonto.
Surely you are the closest so far.	Hubaal waxaad tahay kan ugu dhow ilaa hadda.
I wish you were here	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan joogto
Time to get it again.	Waqti aad ku heli lahayd mar kale.
There is no time.	Waqti ma jiro.
He can get someone else.	Wuxuu heli karaa qof kale.
We can't pay for everything.	Wax walba ma bixin karno.
He said it was good.	Wuxuu sheegay inay fiican tahay.
Not discussed.	Lama wada hadlin.
This is not the case.	Tani maaha sidaas.
That would not do.	Taas ma yeeli lahayn.
They do that.	Waxay sameeyaan taas.
Not true.	Run maaha.
No one will leave you.	Qof kaa tagi maayo.
Often this is not difficult.	Inta badan taasi dhib badan ma aha.
But he knew he could not.	Laakiin wuu ogaa inuusan awoodin.
There may be no problem at all.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan jirin wax dhib ah oo dhan.
And now, this.	Oo hadda, tan.
That was something we did.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan samayno.
What does that do, so.	Maxaa taas sameeyaa, si.
He did not know exactly.	Si sax ah uma uu garanayn.
It looks like something new.	Waxay u egtahay wax cusub.
I told you this.	Tan ayaan kuu sheegay.
There is a lot to work on.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo laga shaqeeyo.
He wants to help you.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ku caawiyo.
I knew that.	Waan ogaa taas.
She likes that.	Way jeceshahay taas.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
Like it was nothing.	Sida waxba ma ahayn.
There are no problems so far.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan ilaa hadda.
It looks like they won't take it anymore.	Waxay u egtahay inaysan sii qaadan doonin.
You can't do what's there.	Ma samayn kartid waxa jira.
This is really not very good.	Tani run ahaantii maaha mid aad u fiican.
It should have had everyone like you.	Waxay ahayd in qof walba oo kula mid ah haysto.
This is the maximum I will pay.	Tani waa inta ugu badan ee aan bixin doono.
Nothing should be too much trouble.	Waxba waa in aanay noqon dhibaato aad u badan.
Maybe that is still true.	Malaha taasi wali waa run.
I never said anything to him.	Weligay waxba uma odhan isaga.
I hope you do that.	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas samaynayso.
There is so much to see.	Wax badan oo la arki karo ayaa jira.
It really isn't.	Runtii uma eka.
Not just as before.	Kaliya maaha sidii hore.
You did everything.	Waxaad samaysay wax kasta.
You should not think so.	Waa inaadan sidaas u malayn.
It won't be too long.	Ma noqon doonto mid aad u dheer.
We may not get more than one chance at this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan helin wax ka badan hal fursad tan.
He is a true friend.	Waa saaxiib run ah.
Maybe he would do it later, he thought.	Malaha wuu samayn lahaa ka dib, wuxuu u maleeyay.
I was surprised to be in that.	Waxaan la yaabay inaan taas ku jiro.
He will always be one of us.	Wuxuu had iyo jeer ahaan doonaa mid naga mid ah.
This is not true today.	Tani maanta run maaha.
Back out.	Dib u baxay.
He was a little surprised.	Wuu yara yaabay.
Here he says.	Waa kan sidaas yidhi.
He is a good friend.	Waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
He would be.	Wuu noqon lahaa .
Much bigger, really.	Wax badan ka weyn, dhab ahaantii.
But that is what you want.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa aad rabto.
She promised she would go.	Waxay ballan qaaday inay aadi doonto.
It is too much to afford.	Waa wax aad u badan in la awoodo.
It was a big surprise.	Waxay ahayd wax weyn oo yaab leh.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
He was a really good man.	Runtii nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
It amazes me.	Waa iga yaab.
I refused.	Waan iska diiday.
I think that is everything.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi tahay wax walba.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
I will do it.	waan samayn doonaa.
We would not do that now.	Taas hadda ma samayn lahayn.
That's what he found himself doing again.	Taasi waa waxa uu isku arkay inuu mar kale sameeyo.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
I have never received any money to do so.	Weligay wax lacag ah ma helin si aan sidaas u sameeyo.
It was so beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan.
How very interesting.	Sidee aad u xiiso badan.
But this is not the end.	Laakiin tani ma dhammaan.
He was a good friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib fiican.
That could be anyone.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
That must be bad for you.	Taasi waa inay kugu xun tahay.
He needs money.	Lacag ayuu u baahan yahay.
She had no idea what it was.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan waxa ay tahay.
Don't give us anything.	Waxba ha na siin.
But that's the way it is.	Laakiin waa sida ay tahay.
I am a man who loves to eat.	Waxaan ahay nin jecel inuu wax cuno.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
Maybe even happier.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xitaa ku faraxsan yahay.
It was quick and clear.	Waxay ahayd mid degdeg ah oo cad.
Trouble.	Dhib ku yimid.
And how to get here.	Iyo sida loo helo halkan.
was not present.	ma joogin.
It sounds familiar, really.	Waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan, dhab ahaantii.
He took it well.	Si fiican ayuu u qaatay.
Take time now.	Waqti qaado hadda.
Just something else.	Kaliya wax kale.
But still nothing.	Laakiin weli waxba.
I did that a little bit.	In yar ayaan sameeyay taas.
I will never believe it.	Weligay ma rumaysan doono.
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
Also several other people from the school.	Sidoo kale dhowr qof oo kale oo dugsiga ka yimid.
In fact, she already has.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay hore u leedahay.
Take something bad.	Qaado wax xun.
There was not much to see.	Wax badan oo la arki jiray ma jirin.
You have been paid.	Lacag ayaa lagu siiyay.
It is not always true.	Had iyo jeer run maaha.
And you will get it, you will always get it.	Oo waad heli doontaa, had iyo jeer waad heli doontaa.
You are very good.	Aad ayaad u fiican tahay.
You said it and it was done.	Adiga ayaa sheegay oo waa la sameeyay.
But it was a good day all said.	Laakiin waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan oo dhan ayaa la yidhi.
Too much.	Aad iyo aad u badan.
I just fell.	Hadda ayaan dhacay.
If she did, it's fine.	Haddii ay samaysay, waa fiican tahay.
It’s always me.	Had iyo jeer waa aniga.
I wish they were more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in ay ka badan yihiin.
You should not.	Waa inaadan.
And this was great.	Oo tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
But I am very happy to learn that you are better.	Laakiin aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan barto inaad ka wanaagsan tahay.
And here is another promise.	Oo halkan waa ballan kale.
I don't like anyone anymore.	Qof dambe ma jecli.
Please let me do this.	Fadlan aan sameeyo tan.
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
I left.	Waan iska baxay.
I don't feel well.	si fiican uma dareemayo.
She doesn't seem to be doing that anymore.	Uma eka inay taas mar dambe samayso.
I think she really likes this.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay dhab ahaantii jeceshahay tan.
He will do what needs to be done.	Wuxuu samayn doonaa waxa loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
He didn't want to know, but he did.	Ma uusan rabin inuu ogaado, laakiin wuu sameeyay.
It's fast.	Waa degdeg.
I will do something else	wax kale ayaan samayn doonaa
No one was present.	Qofna ma joogin.
Nothing really beautiful.	Wax runtii qurux badan maaha.
Maybe he can help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ku caawin karo.
Which was really fun.	Taas oo runtii ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
If he won't talk to you, fine.	Haddii uusan la hadli doonin, waa fiican tahay.
I thought she would leave now.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay hadda bixi doonto.
I can't stop.	Ma joojin karo.
We were nothing but friends.	Waxaan ahayn wax aan ahayn saaxiibo.
He will come alone.	Keligiis ayuu iman doonaa.
He must know something.	Waa inuu wax yaqaan.
I think he believes me now.	Waxay ila tahay inuu hadda i rumaysan yahay.
Maybe not you, but me.	Malaha adiga maaha, laakiin aniga.
You can see it here.	Waxaad ka arki kartaa halkan.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
It's an idea.	Waa fikrad.
Do you know .	Ma ogtahay .
But here.	Laakiin halkan.
But there is really no help.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax caawin ah runtii.
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
It was an opportunity he took.	Waxay ahayd fursad uu ku qaatay.
She is definitely smarter than before.	Waa hubaal inay ka caqli badan tahay sidii hore.
It cannot be spontaneous.	Ma noqon karto wax iska yimid.
No one understood.	Qofna ma fahmin.
Another good man did.	Nin kale oo wanaagsan baa sameeyay.
It is such a great place.	Waa meel sidaas u weyn.
If you like, you can talk to him.	Haddii aad jeceshahay, waad la hadli kartaa isaga.
I can't see	Ma arki karo
No problem.	Wax dhib ah malaha.
A little bit of everything really.	Wax yar oo ka mid ah wax walba runtii.
There were other things as well.	Waxyaabo kale ayaa sidoo kale ahaa.
That surprises me.	Taasi waxay ila tahay yaab.
You need to eat.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad wax cunto.
Let me find something for you.	Aan wax kuu helo.
No one spoke much.	Qofna in badan ma hadlin.
Maybe she was someone he owed money to.	Malaha waxay ahayd qof uu lacag ku lahaa.
I liked it that way.	Anigu sidaas ayaan ka helay.
But this is not surprising.	Laakiin tani wax la yaab leh maaha.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
I couldn’t have had a better time.	Ma aanan heli karin waqti ka fiican.
That would be better than this.	Taasi way ka fiicnaan lahayd tan.
It looks like a lot of work.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo badan.
To eat him.	Si uu isaga u cuno.
But over time,.	Laakiin waqti ka dib, .
She was someone close to us.	Waxay ahayd qof noo dhow.
She can tell he is fine.	Waxay u sheegi kartaa inuu fiican yahay.
There is a car going.	Baabuur baa u socda.
He is likely to be home soon.	Waxa ay u badan tahay in uu dhawaan guriga ka iman doono.
Nothing happened.	Waxba lama dhacay.
There is no prior payment	Ma jiraan wax lacag ah oo hore
She is fine now.	Hadda way fiican tahay.
I tried a little truth.	Waxaan isku dayay run yar.
You think she is very bad at what she is doing.	Waxaad u malaynaysaa inay aad ugu xun tahay waxay samaynayso.
It could not be found	Waa la heli waayay
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
Certainly, it will be so.	Hubaal, waxay ahaan doontaa sidaas.
He loves me so much.	Aad buu ii jecel yahay.
Sometimes we will see him.	Mar mar waan arki doonaa isaga.
But she is smart.	Laakiin way caqli badan tahay.
I think.	Waxaan u maleynayaa.
If you cannot, please let me know.	Haddii aadan awoodin, fadlan ii soo sheeg.
He is a very smart man.	Waa nin caqli badan.
It was a long time.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
He would not make any money.	Wax lacag ah ma uu samayn lahaa.
Tomorrow may also be yesterday.	Berrito ayaa laga yaabaa sidoo kale shalay.
That was a great thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa aad u fiican.
Just right.	Kaliya sax.
I heard you.	Waan ku maqlay.
Maybe I won't see him again.	Malaha mar dambe ma arki doono.
I don't think so.	Uma maleynayo.
He would not do such a thing.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma uu samayn lahaa.
But who really knows.	Laakiin yaa runtii yaqaan.
Interesting, maybe very beautiful yet.	Xiiso leh, malaha aad u qurux badan weli.
Also, it was amazing.	Sidoo kale, waxay ahayd yaab.
And for the most part, they are.	Iyo inta badan, waxay yihiin.
Although he could not say where he would go.	In kasta oo uu sheegi karin halka uu aadi lahaa.
He could not allow that.	Taas wuu u ogolaan waayay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
Maybe he was lucky.	Malaha wuu nasiib badan lahaa.
You can't lie.	Been ma sheegi karto.
I love it too.	Waan jeclahay sidoo kale.
I was always with him.	Had iyo jeer waan la jiray.
Not surprisingly.	Ma aha in wax aan la yaab lahayn.
I will tell you what is in you.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa adiga kugu jira.
Certainly not tonight.	Hubaal caawa maaha.
Someone was already here.	Qof ayaa hore u joogay halkan.
I wanted to work with him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la shaqeeyo.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
I had to get to know him better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si wanaagsan u barto isaga.
And a little less.	Iyo in yar oo ka yar.
Maybe it was luck.	Malaha waxay ahayd nasiib.
He stays home most of the time without doing anything.	Inta badan guriga ayuu iska joogaa isaga oo aan waxba qaban.
Obviously, this can be complicated.	Sida cad, tani waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Ma uu rabin inuu wax ka hadlo.
He constantly lied.	Si joogto ah ayuu been u sheegay.
They will not get enough money.	Lacag ku filan ma heli doonaan.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
Everyone loves something they can't have.	Qof kastaa wuxuu jecel yahay wax uusan haysan karin.
We would leave	Waanu bixi lahayn
He came, well, as a friend.	Wuu yimid, si fiican, saaxiib ahaan.
All in all the best.	Dhammaan waa ugu fiican.
You can't do what you want here.	Halkan kuma samayn kartid waxaad rabto.
If not, please let me know !.	Haddii aysan ahayn, fadlan ii soo sheeg!.
Not as difficult.	Ma aha sida dhib badan.
It looked really beautiful.	Runtii qurux buu u muuqday.
But there was nothing she could do about it.	Laakiin ma jirin wax ay ka qaban karto.
She made a lot of food.	Waxay samaysay cunto badan.
But he returned.	Laakiin wuu noqday.
You did not stop.	Ma aadan joojin.
Not much of a surprise there.	Ma aha wax badan oo la yaab leh halkaas.
Maybe, maybe.	Malaha, malaha.
A lot of them.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah.
He had a new and good one.	Mid cusub oo wanaagsan ayuu lahaa.
Good and solid.	Mid wanaagsan oo adag.
She would see you happy, too.	Waxay ku arki lahayd adiga oo faraxsan, sidoo kale.
That was definitely not me.	Taasi hubaal aniga ma ahayn.
There is not much you can do about it.	Wax badan oo aad ka qaban karto ma aha.
He no longer loves me.	Mar dambe ima jecla.
I never did.	Weligay ma samayn.
I need someone else.	Waxaan u baahanahay qof kale.
It’s small, it doesn’t matter.	Waa wax yar, waxba maaha.
I have a lot to say to you.	Wax badan baan ku leeyahay.
One is the former.	Mid waa kii hore.
No one could see him.	Cidna ma uu arki karin.
He doesn't want to eat, alone.	Ma rabo inuu wax cuno, keligiis.
Not a lot of money.	Lacag badan maaha.
He decided to go home.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu guriga aado.
He knew this.	Wuu ogaa tan.
It will all be great.	Dhammaan waxay noqon doonaan wax weyn.
It will be gone soon.	Dhawaan waa la tagi doonaa.
That is not for me.	Taasi aniga maaha.
I should have known that.	Waxay ahayd inaan taas ogaado.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
And he still does.	Oo uu weli sameeyo.
He was a great man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin weyn.
It is not said what it will be.	Ma aha in la sheego waxa ay noqon doonto .
It will be fine	Way ku fiicnaan doontaa
One in prison.	Mid xabsiga ku jira.
She was smart, after all.	Waxay ahayd mid caqli badan, ka dib oo dhan.
You are very lucky.	Aad baad u nasiib badan tahay.
It is something you should know.	Waa wax ay tahay inaad ogaato.
That is me.	Aniga taasi waa aniga.
No one saw it.	Cidna ma ay arag.
There isn’t enough space here, really.	Ma jiro meel ku filan halkan, runtii.
He never came up with this.	Waligiis tan kama uu soo bixin.
Maybe it's good, it's hard to say for sure.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu fiican yahay, way adag tahay in si hubaal ah loo sheego.
Something similar is going on beautifully everywhere.	Wax la mid ah ayaa si qurux badan meel walba uga socda.
The front room.	Qolka hore.
Someone put it in the past.	Qof meel la dhigay waa hore.
Everyone can talk.	Qof kasta wuu hadli karaa.
This is not the case here.	Halkan tani sidaas maaha.
You are the same person you have always been.	Waxaad tahay isla qofka aad had iyo jeer ahayd.
I don't want him to do anything to me.	Wax uu igu sameeyo ma rabo.
That would take time.	Taasi waxay ku qaadan lahayd muddo.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
He was in trouble.	Dhib buu ku jiray.
And also looked.	Oo sidoo kale eegay.
It was always, always busy.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd, had iyo jeer mashquul.
I tried to leave	Waxaan isku dayay inaan baxo
Here is what you will do.	Ee waxa aad samayn doonto.
It was so you, so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas adiga, sidaas oo kale.
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
I don't really know.	Ma garanayo runtii.
It’s all mine so far.	Waa aniga oo dhan ilaa hadda.
Tell them what you like.	U sheeg wixii aad jeceshahay.
He told us in person.	Qof ahaan buu noo sheegay.
And you are, every day.	Oo waxaad tahay, maalin kasta.
No one will hurt you again.	Qofna mar dambe ku yeeli maayo.
I will have a hard time with him.	Waxaan la qaadan doonaa wakhti adag oo igu filan isaga.
It was not beautiful.	Wax qurux badan ma ahayn.
No one helped me.	Qofna ima caawin.
But it can be anything.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
He found me.	Wuu i helay.
Not now.	Hadda ma aha.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
I will need some	Waxaan u baahan doonaa xoogaa
I know this very well.	Aad ayaan ugu ogahay taas.
It is not difficult to do as it looks.	Ma aha mid adag in la sameeyo sida ay u egtahay.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
Don't catch me.	Ha i qaban.
It was the same thing.	Waxay ahayd wax la mid ah.
There are none.	Ma jiraan.
Somehow, he was.	Si ahaan, wuxuu ahaa.
Now, she didn’t have time.	Hadda, ma aysan haysan waqti.
And really, it is.	Oo runtii, waa.
I think it is the least you can do.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay waxa ugu yar ee aad sameyn kartid.
First, it is not.	Marka hore, waxa aanay ahayn.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
But it won't.	Laakiin ma yeeli doonto.
I'm not talking about money.	Lacag ka hadli maayo.
Such a big deal.	Sida wax weyn maaha.
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi sidaas maaha.
I want her to know.	Waxaan rabaa inay ogaato.
She did not speak for a long time.	Muddo dheer ma ay hadlin.
I want all of me to him.	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan aniga oo dhan isaga.
It's really beautiful, you know.	Runtii wuu qurux badan yahay, waad ogtahay.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
There was nothing better to do.	Ma jirin wax ka wanaagsan oo la sameeyo.
Stop this now.	Jooji tan hadda.
I did not speak.	Ma aan hadlin.
But someone heard.	Laakiin qof buu maqlay.
I have nothing to do.	Wax aan sameeyo ma hayo.
And now they do not exist.	Oo hadda ma jiraan.
He got something.	Wax buu helay.
One may eat.	Mid ayaa laga yaabaa inuu cuno.
The same goes for people.	Isla sidaas oo kale ayaa ah dadka.
He looked at me badly.	Si xun buu ii eegay.
Now I know better.	Hadda si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
.	.
I am not sure.	ma hubo.
I am who I am.	Anigu waxaan ahay qofka aan ahay.
It contains, i.	Waxa ku jira, i.
I know it can't happen.	Waan ogahay inaysan dhici karin.
Why did she do it.	Maxay u samaysay.
I may be able to help you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan awoodo inaan ku caawiyo.
It was so interesting as it looked.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan sida ay u egtahay.
She was right.	Sax bay ahayd.
I really want you	aad baan kuu rabaa
I'm sorry for all of you.	Waan ka xumahay dhammaan.
He spent time at home.	Waxa uu wakhti kula qaadan jiray guriga.
So he said.	Sidaas ayuu lahaa.
Everything is correct, here.	Wax walba waa sax, halkan.
But she was ready.	Laakiin diyaar bay ahayd.
He knew everything.	Wax walba wuu ogaa.
Not there anymore.	Ma aha halkaas mar dambe.
He would take jobs everywhere.	Meel walba shaqo ayuu ka qaadan lahaa.
I don't have time.	Waqti ma hayo.
It looks like it is now as well.	Waxay u egtahay inay hadda sidoo kale tahay.
I had nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo aan aado maan haysan.
The former is now a lie.	Kii hore hadda waa been.
Monday after school.	Isniinta ka dib dugsiga.
It was bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
No one gave anything.	Qofna wax ma siin.
A man is not able to help himself.	Nin ma awoodo inuu is caawiyo.
A little real.	Wax yar oo dhab ah.
You did a very, very good one.	Mid aad iyo aad u wanaagsan ayaad ku samaysay.
He no longer loved me.	Mar dambe ima jeclayn.
It was really a bad time.	Runtii waxay ahayd wakhti aad u xun .
I never said.	Mar ma odhan.
Things will happen	Waxyaabo dhici doona
That was rejected.	Taas waa la diiday.
That is just me.	Taasi waa aniga oo kaliya.
That is probably not what you want.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn waxaad rabto.
That really isn't smart.	Runtii taasi caqli maaha.
Maybe one came in.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu mid ka mid ah soo galay.
I have to go home, he said.	Waa inaan aado guriga, ayuu yidhi.
We can't do the latter.	Tan dambe ma samayn karno.
It may be nothing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan waxba ahayn.
I wanted to be.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo.
All at once.	Dhammaan hal mar.
Maybe it was weird.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ahayd mid la yaab leh.
Not too small.	Aad uma yara.
He's a good guy, you know.	Waa nin fiican, waad ogtahay.
You are a friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib.
Can someone please help me?	Qof fadlan ma i caawin karaa.
But everything will be the same.	Laakiin wax kasta oo ka mid ah ayaa noqon doona.
Everyone has one.	Qof kastaa mid buu leeyahay.
He saw the door.	Albaabka ayuu arkay.
Most did not come.	Inta badan ma aysan iman.
Something hard and constant and real.	Wax adag oo joogto ah oo dhab ah.
He told me.	Wuu ii sheegay.
Very close, friend.	Aad u dhow, saaxiib.
This can be very difficult.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
Tom may be able to.	Tom waxaa laga yaabaa inuu awoodo.
I found it strange.	Waxaan u arkay wax la yaab leh.
He was a lucky man, he knew.	Wuxuu ahaa nin nasiib badan, wuu ogaa.
This is now permanent	Tani hadda waa joogto
Yesterday, you told me an appointment.	Shalay, waxaad igu tidhi ballan.
That is not really what he said.	Runtii taasi maaha waxa uu yidhi.
It is very difficult now.	Aad bay u adag tahay hadda.
No one wants me now.	Qofna ima rabo hadda.
It felt fast.	Degdeg ayaa dareemay.
Not really right.	Runtii sax maaha.
It was not always so.	Mar walba sidaas ma ahayn.
He didn't have much to do.	Wax badan ma ahayn inuu sameeyo.
I was one of them.	Waxaan ka mid ahaa.
I knew it could happen.	Waan ogaa inay dhici karto.
It is always missing.	Mar walba waa la waayay.
He does not have to be in prison.	Ma aha inuu xabsiga ku jiro.
Still doing something.	Weli wax uu sameeyo.
I wonder what happened to him.	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa ku dhacay.
It was very small.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
To find out what he does.	Si uu u ogaado waxa uu sameeyo.
Not sure about everything.	Ma hubo wax walba.
She did not want to do that.	Ma ay rabin inay taas samayso.
He tried.	Wuu isku dayay.
I had to be.	Waxay ahayd inaan noqdo.
Obviously this is too much.	Waxaa cad in tani ay aad u badan tahay.
You just weren’t there.	Kaliya ma aadan joogin.
Several times even.	Dhowr jeer xitaa.
They no longer do it.	Mar dambe ma sameeyaan.
More to do, less time to do.	Wax badan in la sameeyo, waqti aad u yar oo lagu sameeyo.
Please take me	Fadlan i qaado
But he seemed smart.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqday mid caqli badan.
Maybe there is someone better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu jiro qof ka wanaagsan.
She had to stay with him.	Waxay ahayd inay la joogto.
I really need it.	Runtii waa la ii baahan yahay.
I want to see more.	Waxaan rabaa in aan wax badan arko.
I did not say so.	Ma odhan sidaas.
Isn't that right now.	Taasi miyaanay hadda ahayn.
But now something told him there was a problem.	Laakiin hadda wax baa u sheegay in ay dhibaato jirto.
But not all.	Laakiin ma wada aha.
I will not go there	Ma tagi doono halkaas
I need him to do something.	Waxaan u baahanahay inuu wax sameeyo.
It can even get better.	Xitaa wuu fiicnaan karaa.
Not sure how to do it.	Ma hubo sida aad u samaynayso.
I would definitely get this again.	Dhab ahaantii waan heli lahaa tan mar kale.
And a hard day.	Iyo maalin adag.
I found you and no one else.	Waan ku helay oo qof kale ma jirin.
This should not be too difficult.	Tani waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
I didn't want her to lie to people.	Maan rabin in ay dadka been u sheegto.
You will need to be very good.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inay aad u fiican.
That doesn't look like he'll be ready tomorrow.	Taasi uma eka in uu berri diyaar u noqon doono.
I think someone came in.	Waxaan filayaa in qof soo galay.
Owned by one person.	Hal qof baa iska leh.
If you want, you can come too.	Haddii aad rabto, sidoo kale waad iman kartaa.
Apparently, he liked it.	Sida cad, wuu ka helay.
This will be very interesting.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
She was very smart, and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u caqli badan, oo qurux badan.
I have not done this before.	Tan hore uma samayn.
For me, it is me.	Aniga, waa aniga.
This must be done once.	Tani waa in la sameeyaa hal mar.
He would see.	Wuu arki lahaa.
There is something wrong here.	Waxaa jira wax aan sax ahayn halkan.
There is nothing right.	Ma jiro wax sax ah.
It's up to here.	Waa ilaa halkan.
Everyone has the same time.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay waqti isku mid ah.
That sounds familiar, that's right.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan, waa sax.
I bought a lot and put it away.	Wax badan baan soo iibsaday oo meel dhigay.
But many of them are just as bad.	Laakiin in badan oo ka mid ah waa sida xun.
And someone else.	Iyo qof kale .
There is not much you can do.	Wax badan oo aad sameyn karto ma jiraan.
What you have done is real.	Waxa aad samaysay waa dhab.
There is no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jiro.
I definitely had a good time.	Hubaal waqti fiican ayaan helay.
And he would do his best.	Oo wuxuu samayn lahaa waxa ugu wanaagsan.
Do not talk all at once.	Ha wada hadlin hal mar.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
But that's all right now.	Laakiin taasi waa dhammaan hadda.
I think you can tell.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaad sheegi karto.
No one likes you.	Qofna kuma jecla.
I clearly lost it.	Waxaan si cad u waayay.
Not much is known.	Wax badan lama garanayo .
He was a friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib.
I put it well.	Si fiican ayaan u dhigay.
He reluctantly refused to leave.	Si dhib ah ayuu u diiday inuu tago.
It will always need to be done.	Had iyo jeer waxay u baahan doontaa in la sameeyo.
It is expected.	Waa la filayaa.
Maybe a few.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay dhowr.
No one really took it.	Qofna runtii ma qaadan.
It was a good and beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan oo qurux badan.
Something you don't give.	Wax aadan siin.
You will leave this one.	Waad ka bixi doontaa kan.
He is always good.	Mar walba wuu fiican yahay.
And quickly.	Oo si degdeg ah.
Just thought you knew.	Kaliya u maleeyay inaad ogaato.
When I speak harshly.	Marka aan si ba'an u hadlo.
Good man, good man.	Nin wanaagsan, wanaagsan.
Which is really great.	Taas oo runtii aad u weyn.
But I will be.	Laakiin waan ahaan doonaa.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
It is now done.	Hadda waa la sameeyay.
They really didn't believe it.	Runtii ma ay rumaysan.
But it is amazing.	Laakiin waa yaab.
Everyone has one.	Qof kastaa mid buu leeyahay.
It's too much.	Aad ayuu u badan yahay.
This is really, really bad.	Tani waa runtii, runtii aad u xun.
I still didn't want to leave.	Wali ma rabin inaan baxo.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
I went	Waa baxay
you are	waxaad tahay
I have no job.	shaqo ma hayo.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
But he knew otherwise.	Laakiin si kale ayuu u ogaa.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
I knew it would be great.	Waan ogaa inay wax weyn noqon doonto.
Nor do you want to.	Sidoo kale ma rabto.
She will love it there.	Way jeclaan doontaa halkaas.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga aniga.
If it weren't for him, it would be someone else.	Haddii uusan isaga ahayn, waxay noqon lahayd qof kale.
That's all.	Waa dhan.
I don't always know why.	Mar walba ma garanayo sababta.
Not this, surprisingly.	Ma aha tan, yaab leh.
He became like a man to me.	Wuxuu ii noqday sidii nin oo kale.
No one is able to get it.	Qofna ma awoodo inuu helo.
He tried everything.	Wax walba wuu isku dayay.
I need to be able to see	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan arki karo
I want it all, you know? 	Waxaan rabaa dhammaan, ma ogtahay?
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
You can come back	Waad soo noqon kartaa
He needs a true friend.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay saaxiib run ah.
I am one person, but there are three of them.	Waxaan ahay hal qof, laakiin waxaa jira saddex ka mid ah.
You can get it first.	Waad heli kartaa marka hore.
How could that be.	Sidee bay taasi ahaan lahayd.
He was unemployed.	Waxa uu ahaa shaqo la'aan.
Give me another job.	I sii shaqo kale.
And it was like everyone else.	Oo waxay ahayd sida mid kasta.
Now I know what can't happen.	Hadda waan ogahay waxa aan dhici karin.
There was nothing interesting there.	Ma jirin wax xiiso leh halkaas.
She would go.	Way tagi lahayd.
There is no such thing today.	Wax maanta la mid ah ma jiro.
It is abundant everywhere.	Meel walba waa ku badan tahay.
Not for a while.	Ma aha in muddo ah.
We are of the same opinion.	Waxaan nahay isku fikrad.
It looks good.	Si fiican ayuu u muuqdaa.
We cannot pay for that.	Lacag kuma siin karno taas.
Only.	Kaliya.
Same as.	Mid la mid ah.
You love him.	Waad jeceshahay isaga.
That doesn't matter.	Taasi wax maaha.
I can't stay here	Ma joogi karo halkan
They may not always be there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan mar walba halkaas joogin.
Something similar in the past.	Wax hore oo la mid ah.
You can't talk to him.	Ma hadli kartid isaga.
Lots of work.	Shaqo badan.
I always thought she looked like someone I loved.	Waxaan had iyo jeer u maleynayay inay u egtahay qof aad u jecel.
I can't say enough.	Wax ku filan ma odhan karo.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
And there are no beautiful things.	Oo ma jiraan waxyaabo qurux badan.
What an amazing little guy.	Waa maxay nin yar oo yaab leh.
I want to know .	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado .
It is where I am happy.	Waa meesha aan ku faraxsanahay.
He liked a little.	Wax yar ayuu ka helay.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
It is now available	Hadda waa la heli karaa
He saw us as an opportunity, he said.	Wuxuu noo arkay fursad, ayuu yiri.
I told him the truth.	Run baan u sheegay.
It was a lot of work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo aad u badan.
Obviously you still haven’t got it right.	Waxaa cad in aadan weli si sax ah u helin.
He knew it would be a long time.	Wuu ogaa inay iman doonto wakhti dheer.
I will not do that.	Ma yeeli doono taas.
Don't believe me.	Ha i rumaysan.
It is what we have to do.	Waa waxa ay tahay in aan samayno.
You may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan haysan.
At home.	Ee guriga.
Both are still, more than ever.	Labaduba weli waa, in ka badan sidii hore.
It is not real.	Ma ahan mid dhab ah.
Needless to say, no.	Baahnayn in la sheego, ma aha.
In fact it could be more than that.	Dhab ahaantii waxay noqon kartaa wax ka badan taas.
I saw it nearby.	Waxaan arkay meel dhow.
I love him very much.	Aad iyo aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
This may not end well.	Tani si fiican uma dhammaan karto.
A lot is what we are.	Mid badan ayaa ah waxa aan nahay.
To do this we need everyone.	Si tan loo sameeyo waxaan u baahanahay qof walba.
Not for everyone.	Ma ahan qof walba.
Tell me something.	Wax ii sheeg.
He took it.	Wuu ka qaaday.
I just can't see anything.	Kaliya waxba ma arki karo.
That's enough, you know.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay, waad ogtahay.
He thought it would be nice to know.	Wuxuu u maleeyay inay fiicnaan lahayd inuu ogaado.
If they like it, good.	Haddii ay jecel yihiin, wanaagsan.
Now I came up with an idea.	Hadda waxaan la yimid fikrad.
And really affordable.	Oo runtii la awoodi karo.
Let me know if you do not receive it.	I soo sheeg haddii aadan helin.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
But she did not return.	Laakiin kuma ay soo noqon.
He knows what you need.	Wuu garanayaa waxaad u baahan tahay.
He did.	Wuxuu sameeyay.
Three of them are missing.	Saddex ka mid ah waa la waayay.
He would be.	Wuxuu noqon lahaa .
Nothing is going on so far.	Wax ilaa hadda socda ma jiraan.
I don't have to do this.	Ma aha inaan tan sameeyo.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab.
Sorry to see you here	Waan ka xumahay inaan ku arko halkan
I can leave, he said to himself.	Waan bixi karaa, ayuu is yidhi.
To be aware.	In la ogaa.
That is not for me.	Taasi aniga maaha.
Another, is.	Mid kale, waa.
We'll see that, too.	Waan arki doonaa taas, sidoo kale.
Nor was he here.	Sidoo kale ma uusan halkan joogin.
Something out of place.	Wax aan meesha ku jirin.
It's a place to come from.	Waa meel laga yimaado.
Everyone knows that.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay taas.
It's a fun place to work.	Waa meel xiiso badan oo laga shaqeeyo.
I know it's hard.	Waan ogahay inay adag tahay.
I need to know why he rejected me.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta uu ii diiday.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
Maybe she had a place.	Malaha meel bay ku lahayd.
I can hardly fall again.	Si adag ayaan mar kale u dhici karaa.
I can't go	Ma tagi karin
It should not be stretched sufficiently.	Waa in aan si ku filan loo kala bixin.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
An invisible place.	Meel aan la arki karin.
She said something.	Wax bay tidhi.
It had nothing to do with that.	Wax shaqo ah kuma ay lahayn taas.
He looked tough and tough.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid adag oo adag.
I didn't want to see it.	Ma rabin inaan arko.
I really hope you will too.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas yeeli doonto.
Maybe none of us do.	Malaha mid naga mid ah ma samaynayo.
But that will be the same for him.	Laakiin taasi waxay la mid noqon doontaa isaga.
But nowhere else.	Laakiin meel kale ma jirto.
I always had food.	Had iyo jeer waxaan lahaa cunto.
I think it is good.	Waxaan qabaa inay tahay mid wanaagsan.
He does not work to have time.	Ma shaqeeyo si uu waqti u helo.
That should tell you something.	Taasi waa inay wax kuu sheegto.
Maybe she should tell him.	Malaha waa inay u sheegto.
I always think so.	Mar walba taas ayaan u maleynayaa.
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
It was not right.	Wax sax ah kuma ahayn.
I told the truth.	Run baan sheegay.
It is enough for me to be beautiful.	Way igu filan tahay wax qurux badan.
I know you can enjoy it.	Waan ogahay inaad ka heli karto.
It is what you do.	Waa waxa aad samayso.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
They would not stay here much longer.	In badan ma ay sii joogi lahayn halkan.
I promised that.	Taas ayaan u ballan qaaday.
I’ve seen it all at once.	Waxaan arkay taas oo dhan hal mar.
I wish it was not so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
Everything is included.	Wax walba waa ku jiraan.
I would love to see you again	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale arko
It was also a little.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd wax yar.
Everything she might have had.	Wax kasta oo laga yaabo inay lahayd.
It didn't take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan.
It's a bit complicated.	Waa xoogaa dhib badan.
I was not in a good place.	Meel fiican maan joogin.
I had a good time, for sure.	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay, hubaal.
It can happen anytime, anywhere anyone.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa wakhti kasta, meel kasta qof kasta.
No one will be harmed.	Cidna waxba yeeli maayo.
But this is the best.	Laakiin tani waa tan ugu fiican.
This was another day.	Tani waxay ahayd maalin kale.
He would even believe it.	Xitaa wuu rumaysan lahaa.
Too many cars.	Baabuur aad u badan.
They will probably find some fun today.	Waxay u badan tahay inay maanta heli doonaan xoogaa xiiso ah.
No more.	Mar dambe ma jirto.
That is not for you.	Taasi adiga oo kale maaha.
And now it was known what it was.	Oo hadda waa la ogaa waxay ahayd.
But there is no.	Laakiin ma jirto.
It’s the only thing he does.	Waa waxa kaliya ee uu sameeyo.
Always, he said.	Mar kasta, ayuu yidhi.
I hope you know that.	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas ogtahay.
I really don’t.	Run ahaantii ma sameeyo.
I think that makes sense.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi caqli badan tahay.
We were work colleagues.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo shaqo.
I wouldn’t have you.	Ma haysan lahaa adiga.
In fact, this is to be expected.	Dhab ahaantii, tani waa la filayaa.
I wish they did.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay sameeyaan.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
When set	Markii la dhigay
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
It could be something else as well.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kale sidoo kale.
And everything.	Iyo wax walba .
It would be again.	Waxay noqon lahayd mar kale.
He wanted to do something.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax sameeyo.
This will be good for us.	Tani way noo fiicnaan doontaa.
She would go.	Way tagi lahayd.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
It was to be expected.	Waxay ahayd waxa laga filan karo.
He heard something.	Wax buu maqlay.
I started talking.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan hadlo.
I am very happy, really.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay, runtii.
do not believe anything.	waxba ha rumaysan.
It doesn't matter to him.	Dhib kuma aha isaga.
You can't do it big time.	Ma sameyn kartid waqti weyn.
I hope you are well and happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad wanaagsan tahay oo aad faraxsan tahay.
Tell them it is really nothing.	U sheeg in aanay run ahaantii waxba ahayn.
It really is me.	Runtii waa aniga.
It was a bad job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo xun.
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
But we are.	Laakiin waxaan nahay.
No one will do it again.	Qofna mar dambe ma yeeli doono.
No one else will.	Mid kale ma yeeli doono.
He had to do it.	Waxa uu ahaa in uu sameeyo .
It's been a while, really.	Way ka hor, dhab ahaantii.
You told me more than once.	Waxaad ii sheegtay in ka badan hal mar.
There was no problem with him.	Wax dhib ah kuma lahayn isaga.
I couldn't stop.	Waan joojin waayay.
I hope you do.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso.
I think he can do it.	Waxaan filayaa inuu samayn karo.
I'm sure it won't hurt.	Waxaan hubaa in aanay waxba ka yeeli doonin.
This is a really good thing.	Tani waa wax aad u fiican runtii.
It could be.	Waxay noqon kartaa.
I also found a friend, a very good friend.	Waxaan sidoo kale helay saaxiib, saaxiib aad u wanaagsan.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
Tell me how it will be.	Sida ay noqon doonto ii sheeg.
I always did.	Mar walba waan samayn jiray.
Lots of favorites here.	Waxyaabo badan oo la jecel yahay halkan.
You know, this is a big problem.	Waad ogtahay, tani waa dhibaato weyn.
Very good indeed.	Aad u fiican runtii.
He was clear.	Wuxuu ahaa mid cad.
He should come here soon.	Waa inuu halkan yimaado dhawaan.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
You don't have to do much.	Ma aha inaad wax badan samayso.
Nothing good will come of it.	Wax wanaagsan kama iman doonaan taas.
It could be how you look.	Waxay noqon kartaa sida aad u egtahay.
Everyone has a problem.	Qof kastaa dhib buu leeyahay.
He told me he was.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inuu yahay.
It is still a good place.	Wali waa meel fiican.
I still can't do it right	Wali si sax ah uma samayn karo
I am very sorry about this.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay arrintan.
You can see one today if you are lucky.	Waxaad arki kartaa mid maanta haddii aad nasiib leedahay.
I told him so.	Waxaan u sheegay sidaas.
I tell you that.	Taas baan kugu leeyahay.
He needs to talk to me.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay inuu ila hadlo.
That is probably not needed.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inaan loo baahnayn.
You will do it in no time.	Waxaad samayn doontaa in aan waqti.
Even that was not a good thing.	Xitaa taasi wax wanaagsan ma ahayn.
Not as long as you are there.	Ma aha ilaa inta aad halkaas joogto.
I can do that	Taas waan samayn karaa
He has always been.	Waligiis wuu joogay.
That’s exactly what you should help him do.	Taasi waa dhab ahaan waxa ay tahay inaad ka caawiso inuu sameeyo.
It has now been revoked.	Hadda waa laga noqday.
You would not go there.	Halkaas ma aadi lahayd.
But he would do well.	Laakiin wax wanaagsan ayuu u samayn lahaa.
Properly made, there is no such thing.	Si sax ah loo sameeyay, ma jiraan wax la mid ah.
It should not be non-existent.	Waa in aanu noqon mid aan waxba ka jirin.
I am so glad you are here !.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad halkaan joogto!.
Just a big man like that.	Kaliya nin weyn oo sidaas oo kale ah.
He decided that the latter was more likely.	Wuxuu go'aansaday in kan dambe ay u badan tahay.
He would be great here.	Waxa uu noqon lahaa mid fiican halkan.
I wanna leave	waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
You have to want to do it.	Waa inaad rabto inaad sameyso.
tell me what to do.	ii sheeg waxa aan sameeyo.
There is no time to go back to school.	Ma jirto wakhti lagu noqdo dugsiga.
Only one person.	Hal qof kaliya.
Everything that will happen will happen soon.	Wax kasta oo dhici doona ayaa dhawaan dhici doona.
Smart, but good.	Caqli badan, laakiin fiican.
Maybe it's true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay run tahay.
so it did not come out.	sidaas kuma ay soo bixin.
There is nothing you can do.	Ma jiraan wax aad sameyn karto.
This will do.	Tani waxay sameyn doontaa.
I don't want this.	Ma doonayo tan.
He said I could be better than you.	Waxa uu yidhi waan kaa fiicnaan karaa.
I'll just do it.	Kaliya waan sameyn doonaa.
You can get more than one.	Waxaad heli kartaa wax ka badan hal.
Both are very beautiful.	Labaduba aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
There is no exit	Ma jiro baabuur laga baxo
He wondered what he was doing.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa uu ku sameeyo.
She did not return.	Ma ay soo noqon.
I have someone.	qof baan leeyahay.
That should not be too difficult.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
But that still doesn't matter.	Laakiin taasi weli waxba maaha.
I got it most of the time.	Inta badan waan helay.
I want to know what happened and why.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado waxa dhacay iyo sababta.
I will never be able to eat together.	Weligay ma awoodi doono inaan wada cuno.
It was still a beautiful early morning.	Wali waxay ahayd goor hore oo qurux badan.
If you do, everything will be fine.	Haddii aad sameyso, wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan.
There is nothing new.	Ma jiraan wax ku cusub.
He says.	Wuxuu leeyahay .
I don't see why.	Ma arko sababta.
But not just any one.	Laakiin ma aha oo kaliya mid kasta.
In fact, everything is correct.	Dhab ahaantii, wax walba waa sax.
I'm sorry, really.	Waan ka xumahay, runtii.
We knew it would be a long day.	Waxaan ogeyn inay maalin dheer noqon doonto.
We can't agree.	Ma ogolaan karno.
He just came in.	Kaliya wuu soo galay.
The reason was not stated.	Sababta lama sheegin.
No cars were seen.	Ma jirin wax baabuur ah oo la arkay.
More friends.	In ka badan saaxiibo.
It will take more than one of us.	Waxay qaadan doontaa in ka badan mid naga mid ah.
They are for everyone.	Waxay u yihiin qof walba.
Very bad indeed.	Aad u xun runtii.
It can't be much.	Wax badan ma noqon karto.
Not the same.	Isku mid maaha.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
This would always happen.	Tani mar walba way dhici lahayd.
Not a good day.	Maalin wanaagsan maaha.
Here is what you need to know.	Waa kan waxa ay tahay inaad ogaato.
I'll tell you what.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa.
I think it was a surprise to him.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay ahayd yaab isaga.
He was a great man.	Nin badan buu ahaa.
I didn’t have time to find out more.	Maan helin wakhti aan wax badan ku ogaado.
As I will be.	Sida aan ahaan doono.
They did not stop.	Ma ay joojin.
You can stay there tonight.	Waad joogi kartaa halkaas caawa.
There was so much.	Waxaa jiray aad u badan.
It was really awful.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
That is what will happen.	Taasi waa waxa dhici doona.
Who knew he had one.	Yaa ogaa inuu mid lahaa.
But that is not the main reason.	Laakiin taasi maaha sababta ugu weyn.
They are much harder.	Aad bay uga sii adag yihiin.
He told me everything.	Wax walba wuu ii sheegay.
We can't do it.	Ma samayn karno.
who knows.	yaa yaqaan.
He had no place to leave here.	Ma haysan meel uu ka tago halkan.
You know what, I will do it.	Waad ogtahay waxa, waan sameyn doonaa.
Everyone spent time with each one.	Qof kastaa wuxuu waqti ku qaatay mid kasta.
It was bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun.
Mary was right.	Maryan sax bay ahayd.
For me that was a great thing to see.	Aniga taasi waxay ii ahayd wax weyn in la arko.
It may be difficult for him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku adag tahay isaga.
I wonder where she is now.	Waxaan la yaabanahay halka ay hadda joogto.
This is where you will be.	Tani waa meesha aad joogi doonto.
Take time with me.	Waqti ila qaado.
And he wanted to.	Oo uu rabay.
After all.	Ka dib oo dhan .
If they are good that is it.	Haddii ay wanaagsan yihiin taasi waa.
Lots of friends.	Saaxiibo badan oo badan.
Good when it's good.	Wanaagsan marka ay wanaagsan tahay.
Now it was the same.	Hadda waxay ahayd isku mid.
It has been a long time coming.	Muddo dheer ayuu soo baxay.
He was one of them.	Waxa uu ka mid ahaa.
But it was given to him and well.	Laakiin waxaa la siiyay in isaga iyo si fiican.
It will help a lot.	Wax badan bay caawin doontaa.
I will be fine with you.	Waan ku fiicnaan doonaa.
That he tried to talk about it.	In uu isku dayay in uu ka hadlo.
That is not the case here and now.	Taasi maaha halkan iyo hadda.
Beautiful things	Waxyaabo qurux badan
.	.
He was a good man.	Nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
They are long.	Way dheer yihiin.
It’s not like real work.	Ma aha sida shaqo dhab ah.
He did, not me.	Wuu sameeyay, aniga ma aha.
That is what we do.	Taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
Just a bad day, a hard day.	Kaliya maalin xun, maalin adag.
In fact, there is more to it than that.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa jira wax ka badan taas.
But he did not say that.	Laakiin taas uma uu sheegin.
That is obvious.	Taasi waa wax iska cad.
It is not just someone who is able to do that.	Ma aha qof kaliya inuu awoodo inuu taas sameeyo.
We would have been close.	Waan u dhawaan lahayn.
Why is it a good idea.	Waa maxay sababta ay u tahay fikrad wanaagsan.
I will not go immediately.	Meel degdeg ah kuma aadi doono.
But he was.	Laakiin waxa uu ahaa.
But it will not be a big deal.	Laakiin wax weyn ma noqon doonto.
Not so long.	Ma aha sidaas u dheer.
If not, that is not true.	Haddii aadan, taasi run maaha.
I was young.	Waxaan ahaa mid yar.
She refused that.	Way diiday taas.
He did not say the same thing to me.	Wax la mid ah ima uu odhan.
It may not be right at first.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sax ahayn marka hore.
That was the room.	Taasi waxay ahayd qolka.
There is not much I need.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo aan u baahanahay.
I did not.	Maan samayn.
Certainly not money.	Hubaal lacag maaha.
Tell her how it is.	U sheeg sida ay tahay.
Not now.	Hadda ma leh.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha wax la mid ah.
busy, but great.	mashquul, laakiin weyn.
Not just you.	Ma aha sidaas adiga kaliya.
I don't have time for that.	Waqti uma hayo taas.
I knew better.	Si ka sii fiican ayaan u ogaa.
He was an old friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib hore.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
And what we are not.	Iyo waxa aanu ahayn.
It is new.	Waa mid cusub.
Someone like that.	Qof sidaas u jecel.
Whatever he does he does his best.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyo waxa uu u sameeyaa sida ugu wanaagsan.
You must not love me.	Waa inaadan i jeclaan.
It's hard.	Way ku adag tahay.
Now, she would do it.	Hadda, way yeeli lahayd.
We need something new and exciting.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax cusub oo xiiso leh.
There are several.	Waxaa jira dhowr.
New things to learn.	Waxyaabo cusub oo la barto.
He did a lot.	Wax badan buu ka dhigay.
Unknown location.	Meesha aan la garanayn.
He has been like this for a long time.	Muddo dheer ayuu sidaas ku jiray.
I really like it.	Sida runtii runtii jecel.
You can get out of this.	Waad ka bixi kartaa tan.
I think it is beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan tahay.
That is everything.	Taasi waa wax walba.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
It would be interesting.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid xiiso leh.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn kartid.
But it is nothing new.	Laakiin wax cusub maaha.
Maybe it always has been.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay had iyo jeer ahayd.
I was not lucky.	Nasiib uma helin.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
I know she loves him.	Waan ogahay inay jeceshahay isaga.
I'm surprised you don't know that.	Waxaan la yaabay inaadan taas ogayn.
I couldn’t do that.	Taas ma yeeli karin.
This is usually what you want.	Tani inta badan waa waxa aad rabto.
He was the same person.	Isku qof buu ahaa.
I will always love him.	Mar walba waan jeclaan doonaa isaga.
It is not something to do at home.	Ma ahan wax guriga lagu sameeyo.
This was so much more.	Tani waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
I would do anything to go home.	Waxaan samayn lahaa wax kasta oo aan guriga ku aado.
After all, I did not have.	Ka dib oo dhan, ma aan haysan.
I know, too.	Waan ogahay, sidoo kale.
But now you know you know.	Laakiin hadda waad ogtahay inaad ogtahay.
You know he has a problem.	Waad ogtahay inuu dhib qabo.
I'm sure there is something.	Waan hubaa inay wax jiraan.
I want you to do the same.	Waxaan kaa rabaa sidaas oo kale.
I have never done anything like this.	Weligay ma aanan samayn tan oo kale.
But none of us can get it.	Laakiin mid naga mid ah ma heli karo.
It really is what it is.	Runtii waa waxa ay tahay.
I am somewhere else now.	Meel kale ayaan hadda joogaa.
I got a lot out of here	Aad ayaan halkan uga baxay
There was no way to tell.	Ma jirin si loo sheego.
Maybe you like it too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay.
I knew she would be like me.	Waan ogaa inay ila mid ahaan doonto.
Spend time with your loved ones.	Waqti la qaado dadka aad jeceshahay.
She was not at home.	Ma aysan joogin guriga.
There is not much space.	Meel badan ma jirto.
To see you again.	Si aan mar kale ku arko.
But at first it is difficult.	Laakiin marka hore way adag tahay.
I felt so bad.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u xun.
Very good, he should go.	Aad u fiican, waa inuu aado.
He found this amazing.	Waxa uu helay tan la yaab leh.
Not how hard it is.	Ma aha sida ay u adag tahay.
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
I want to know what he said.	Waxaan rabaa in aan ogaado waxa uu ku yidhi.
I am somewhere else.	Meel kale ayaan joogaa.
He is there.	Meesha ayuu joogaa.
But this is not difficult.	Laakiin tani maaha mid adag.
I don't know the rest.	Ma garanayo inta kale.
I would think they are very similar.	Waxaan u malayn lahaa inay aad isku mid yihiin.
After all, he was there.	Ka dib oo dhan, wuu joogay.
He felt it here.	Wuu ka dareemay halkan.
But, and it is great but.	Laakiin, oo waa weyn laakiin.
If it was just hard, that wouldn’t be a problem.	Haddii ay kaliya tahay mid adag, taasi dhib ma ahaan lahayd.
Not great, but enough is enough.	Ma aha mid weyn, laakiin waa ku filan tahay.
More, not less.	Wax badan, ma yara.
No one came to help.	Qofna uma iman inuu caawiyo.
He is a good and good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan oo fiican.
That is prison.	Taasi waa xabsiga.
Still, he did it only once.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, waxa uu sameeyay hal mar oo kaliya.
And a really good guy.	Oo runtii nin wanaagsan.
No one gets it.	Qofna ma helo.
There is nothing new, even.	Wax cusub ma jiraan, xitaa.
Something happened	Wax baa dhacay
And everyone will be fine.	Oo qof kastaa wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
I was there for a long time.	Wax badan ayaan u joogay.
It's really smart.	Runtii waa caqli badan tahay.
Now it is again.	Hadda waa mar kale.
He was in it for a while.	Waxa uu ku jiray waqti yar.
But that will not help now.	Laakiin taasi hadda ma caawin doonto.
I got it that way.	Waxaan helay sidaas oo kale.
I am just a white man.	Waxaan ahay nin cad oo kaliya.
He could not leave now.	Hadda ayuu bixi waayay.
There are also three.	Sidoo kale waa saddex.
It was really long.	Waxay ahayd runtii dheer.
We need something going on	Waxaan u baahanahay wax sii socda
But hardly anyone left.	Laakiin si dhib leh qofna wuu baxay.
I did it once	hal mar ayaan sameeyay
I will surely come.	Hubaal waan iman doonaa.
This is amazing.	Tani waa mid la yaab leh.
It would be too much now.	Waxay noqon lahayd mid aad u badan hadda.
And you have to do it quickly.	Oo waa inaad si degdeg ah u sameyso.
No one was present.	Qofna ma joogin.
This is not beautiful.	Tani qurux maaha.
Not one person came out.	Hal qof uma soo bixin.
That he can do it.	In uu samayn karo.
It's too big.	Aad bay u weyn tahay.
That is not everywhere.	Taas meel walba ma aha.
And, for the most part, they are.	Iyo, inta badan, waxay yihiin.
Someone picked it up.	Qof baa soo qaaday.
I was happy, but surprised.	Waan ku faraxsanahay, laakiin la yaabay.
I would like to.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan.
It is probably much smaller than that.	Waxay u badan tahay in ay aad uga yar tahay taas.
But no luck.	Laakiin nasiib ma leh.
But none of us.	Laakiin mid naga mid ah ma jiro.
And so on.	Iyo wax la mid ah.
Still, and still.	Weli, iyo weli.
He can readily believe this.	Tan si diyaar ah ayuu u rumaysan karaa.
It really is a great place to be.	Runtii waa meel aad u fiican in la joogo.
As he did not want to say.	Sida ma uusan rabin inuu sheego.
It will be hard work.	Waxay noqon doontaa shaqo adag.
As someone with.	Sida qof leh .
I took this issue seriously.	Waxaan si adag u eegay arrintan.
He is a man.	Waa nin.
But it is not certain.	Laakiin lama hubo.
I'm not sure she did much good.	Ma hubo in ay wax badan oo wanaagsan samaysay.
Tonight is not too much.	Caawa aad uma badna.
I told her it was good.	Waxaan u sheegay inay fiican tahay.
I want to talk to him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo.
I told him.	Waan u sheegay isaga.
This should not be done.	Tani waa in aan la samayn.
And more.	Oo ka badan.
He got it early.	Goor hore ayuu helay.
not today.	ma maanta.
We give you a chance.	Waxaan ku siin fursad.
I'm just happy with that.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
It was so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas.
I should have known this.	Waxay ahayd inaan tan ogaado.
Very real and interesting idea.	Fikrad aad u run ah oo xiiso leh.
To this day.	Ilaa maanta.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
Maybe it was true.	Malaha run bay ahayd.
I am happy with everything.	Wax walba waan ku faraxsanahay.
I hope she has.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay leedahay.
You can talk to him.	Waad la hadli kartaa isaga.
I would like to work on this issue quickly.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aan si degdeg ah arrintan uga shaqeeyo.
A little bit.	Wax yar oo yar.
I may need it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u baahanahay.
It can do anything, anyone, anytime.	Waxay samayn kartaa wax kasta, qof kasta, wakhti kasta.
In fact, you are the worst.	Dhab ahaantii, adiga ayaa ugu xun.
You are even taller.	Xitaa waad dheer tahay.
It’s a job, just like any other job.	Waa shaqo, sida shaqo kasta oo kale.
There was no one better.	Qofna wax ka fiican ma jirin.
I haven't seen anything yet.	Weli waxba ma arag.
It was after.	Waxay ahayd ka dib.
This is true.	Tani waa runtii.
One he never said, he thought.	Mid aan waligiis odhan, ayuu mooday.
It won't take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan doonto.
This is not the same.	Tani isku mid maaha.
There is no problem with that.	Dhib kuma jirto taas.
Otherwise it is not a lie.	Haddii kale been maaha.
And saw.	Oo arkay.
In fact, there is nothing.	Run ahaantii, ma jiraan wax jira.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
You would not believe it.	Ma rumaysan lahayd.
It is difficult to maintain.	In la isku hayo waa adag tahay.
He probably would have stayed there.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu halkaas ku sii ahaan lahaa.
Not much.	Ma badna.
Very nice surprise.	Yaab aad u fiican.
I knew what they would do to me.	Waan ogaa waxay igu samayn doonaan.
But they no longer believed him.	Laakiin mar dambe ma ay rumaysan isaga.
This is where I go.	Waa meesha aan ka baxo.
There may not be enough money to buy food.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan jirin lacag ku filan oo lagu iibsado cunto.
It is enough, if he does so.	Way ku filan tahay, haddii uu sidaas sameeyo.
Someone you love.	Qof aad jeceshahay.
He was still ready to be friends.	Wuxuu weli diyaar u ahaa inuu saaxiibo noqdo.
And here it can't be right.	Oo halkan si sax ah uma noqon karto.
I would like to go now.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan aado hadda.
This is not correct.	Tani sax maaha.
Which is not surprising.	Taas oo aan la yaab ahayn.
I used to see.	Waan arki jiray.
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aad u badan.
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
It always looks like that.	Had iyo jeer waxay u egtahay sidaas.
Well said.	Si fiican loo sheegay.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
But really everything.	Laakiin runtii wax walba.
I really hope you like it too.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay.
It was a living place.	Waxay ahayd meel nool.
You will see me again.	Mar kale ayaad i arki doontaa.
He was somewhere.	Meel buu joogay.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
It is so beautiful.	Waa mid aad u qurux badan.
Anyone but me.	Qof walba oo aan aniga ahayn.
But that was three years ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd saddex sano ka hor.
I do not work in prison.	Anigu xabsiga kama shaqeeyo.
Time to come out.	Waqti aan ku soo bixi lahayn.
Maybe he already got it and didn’t know it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hore u helay oo aanu ogayn.
I can hardly believe it.	Si dhib ah uma rumaysan karo.
I was lucky.	Nasiib ayaan lahaa.
I found interesting things.	Waxaan helay waxyaabo xiiso leh.
I always knew you would.	Mar walba waan ogaa inaad sameyn doonto.
I just couldn't help it.	Kaliya waan caawin waayay.
This can be interesting.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid xiiso leh.
That was a lot more.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
Everything is true.	Wax walba waa run.
But that is not how he feels now.	Laakiin taasi maaha sida uu hadda dareemayo.
Don't tell me.	Ha ii sheegin .
Now it is.	Hadda waa .
But he knows.	Laakiin wuu garanayaa.
The rest is all mine.	Inta kale waa aniga oo dhan.
And so far, very good.	Oo ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan.
.	.
It's really hard.	Runtii aad bay u adag tahay.
I don’t think you do.	Uma maleynayo inaad sameyso.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I am ready to go	diyaar ayaan u ahay inaan tago
You can also do the same at the same time.	Waxaad sidoo kale samayn kartaa isla waqti isku mid ah.
I am very happy to have it.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan helo.
All alone.	Dhammaan keligiis.
It was even harder than that.	Waxa uu ahaa mid ka sii adag taas.
He can be a very bad person.	Wuxuu noqon karaa qof aad u xun.
She can't do any real work right now.	Wax shaqo ah oo dhab ah hadda kama ay qaban karto.
It's a car, but it's a good car.	Waa baabuur, laakiin waa baabuur fiican.
You cannot do this alone.	Tani ma samayn kartid keligaa.
I will come back to this later.	Waan ku soo noqon doonaa tan dambe.
It looks like yesterday.	Waxay u egtahay sidii shalay oo kale.
That was a little weird for me.	Taasi waxay ila ahayd wax yar oo yaab leh.
Not surprisingly, it did not turn out well.	La yaab ma leh, si fiican uma ay noqon.
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
That can be great.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u fiican.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
Maybe that won't come.	Malaha taasi ma iman doonto.
I had to help.	Waxaan ahaa in aan caawiyo.
I thought you should know that.	Waxaan u maleeyay in aad taas ogaato.
He knew.	Wuu ogaa .
This had nothing to do with it.	Tani wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn.
It is a place with a lot of food.	Waa meel cunto badan leh.
I know it looks bad.	Waan ogahay inay u egtahay mid xun.
Really happy.	Runtii aad u faraxsan.
He will now be here	Hadda wuu joogi doonaa halkan
There was not enough food at home.	Ma jirin cunto ku filan guriga.
There is something unknown.	Wax aan la garanayn baa jira.
But that is how it is.	Laakiin taasi waa sida ay tahay.
It is also more so.	Sidoo kale waa ka sii badan yahay.
I lost	waan waayay
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I have to do the same for him for a while.	Waa inaan sidaas oo kale u sameeyaa isaga in muddo ah.
You have to do a lot of things.	Waa inaad sameyso waxyaabo badan.
Now that is interesting.	Hadda taasi waa mid xiiso leh.
But it was not him.	Laakiin ma ahayn isaga.
Let it come out.	Ha soo baxo.
This is a bit difficult.	Tani waa xoogaa adag.
I looked good.	Si fiican ayaan u eegay.
Not him.	Ma isaga.
Much older than you.	In badan kaa weyn.
He is better.	Isaga ayaa ka fiican.
He was not smart.	Ma uu ahayn caqli badan.
It was given to me a few years ago.	Waxaa la i siiyay dhowr sano ka hor.
Both are beautiful and amazing.	Labaduba waa qurux iyo yaab.
I knew she would be there.	Waan ogaa inay halkaas joogi doonto.
I can no longer do that.	Taas mar dambe ma samayn karo.
He does most of it.	Inta ugu badan ayuu sameeyaa.
We need friends	Waxaan u baahanahay saaxiibo
I wish it weren’t so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in aanay noqon sidaas.
It’s all they do.	Waa waxa ay sameeyaan oo dhan.
You look like him.	Waxaad u egtahay isaga.
They will find us.	Way na heli doonaan.
But she refused.	Laakiin way diiday.
This will not happen.	Tani ma dhici doonto.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma hayo.
But this is not true everywhere.	Laakiin tani run maaha meel kasta.
Certainly not the same.	Hubaal isku si maaha.
As always.	Sida uu had iyo jeer yahay.
No one has done that before.	Qofna hore uma samayn taas.
But he took it from me, in the same way.	Laakiin wuu iga qaaday, si la mid ah.
He owned it, only him.	Isaga ayaa iska lahaa, isaga kaliya.
I will stay here	Waxaan sii joogi doonaa halkan
But it is also a problem.	Laakiin sidoo kale waa dhibaato.
Hold on tight.	Si adag ugu qabo.
But he has something bad going on.	Laakiin waxa uu leeyahay wax xun oo dhacay.
But it really didn’t matter if he did.	Laakiin runtii dhib ma lahayn haddii uu sameeyay.
But tonight something happened.	Laakiin caawa wax baa dhacay.
This should not be the case.	Tani waa inaysan sidaas noqon.
But it is still interesting.	Laakiin weli waa mid xiiso leh.
Tomorrow, for sure.	Berri, waa hubaal.
Still, he didn’t want to get out of it.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, ma uusan rabin in uu ka soo baxo.
It will end soon	Degdeg bay u dhammaan doontaa
I did nothing wrong.	Wax xun maan samayn.
So far, very good, man.	Ilaa hadda, aad u wanaagsan, nin.
I am ready	diyaar ayaan ahay
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I think that's a problem.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi dhibaato tahay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Someone picked it up.	Qof baa soo qaaday.
I wondered who.	Waxaan la yaabay cidda.
Maybe that's where she is.	Malaha waa meesha ay joogto.
It can happen to people.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa dadka.
He was very bad.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u xun.
That is difficult, as you know.	Taasi waa adag tahay, sida aad ogtahay.
He can leave at any time.	Markii uu doono wuu bixi karaa.
And no more.	Oo mar dambe maaha.
Also, no one here had to leave.	Sidoo kale, qofna halkan ma ahayn inuu baxo.
There is one.	Waxaa jira mid.
So far, very beautiful.	Ilaa hadda, aad u qurux badan.
He would talk.	Wuu hadli lahaa.
And after each, there is always another.	Oo mid kasta ka dib, mar walba waxaa jira mid kale.
It should not be taken.	Ma aha in la qaado.
I had no money.	Lacag maan haysan.
This has a little bit of everything.	Tani waxay leedahay wax yar oo ka mid ah wax kasta.
That is not to say.	Taas oo aan la odhan.
It was a blatant lie.	Been cad bay ahayd.
I went once.	Hal mar ayaan aaday.
This is for sure.	Tani waa hubaal.
He could not leave.	Wuu ka tagi waayay.
The rest.	Inta kale.
That is not the same.	Taasi isku mid maaha.
What a great thing to do.	Waa maxay wax weyn in la sameeyo.
He is who you are.	Waa qofka aad tahay.
Not as she did.	Ma aha sidii ay samaysay.
I didn't think so.	Wax ma malaynayn.
There is a lot of good here.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo wanaagsan halkan.
This does not look too bad.	Tani uma eka mid aad u xun.
I was real.	dhab baan ahaa.
It may be, it will not be.	Waxay noqon kartaa, ma ahaan doonto.
I can talk about it, but I don't feel it.	Waan ka hadli karaa, laakiin ma dareemayo.
Take my time.	Waqti igu qaado.
I'm sure you don't know.	Waxaan hubaa inaadan garanayn.
No wonder.	La yaab ma leh.
Tell her how it is.	U sheeg sida ay tahay.
Hold on, hold on.	Qabo, qabo.
Let me tell you that was a lot more fun.	Aan kuu sheego taasi waxay ahayd mid aad uga xiiso badan.
You look so beautiful now.	Waxaad hadda u egtahay mid aad u qurux badan.
Surprising surprise.	Yaab yaab leh.
One really small, very beautiful.	Mid runtii aad u yar, aad u qurux badan.
Maybe she lied.	Malaha been bay sheegtay.
That is not why she is here.	Taasi maaha sababta ay halkan u joogto.
I took it really well.	Runtii si fiican ayaan u qaatay.
Only me, me, me.	Kaliya aniga, aniga, aniga.
I should not have been able to do it.	Ma ahayn inaan awoodo inaan sameeyo.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay .
The less you say, the better.	Inta yar ee la sheego, ayaa ka wanaagsan.
Now it will be the same.	Hadda waxa ay ahaan doontaa sidii hore.
It is not a job.	Ma aha shaqo.
He wanted it badly.	Si xun buu u rabay.
Not that it was surprising.	Ma aha in ay taasi la yaab ahayd.
It's really bad.	Runtii aad bay u xun tahay.
I came back and was surprised.	Waan soo noqday oo yaabay.
It can be very good.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
Something came up.	Wax baa soo galay.
But also.	Laakiin sidoo kale.
They need me here.	Waxay ii baahan yihiin halkan.
This is pretty cool.	Tani waa iska fiican.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I think he wants to talk to me alone.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu doonayo inuu keligiis ila hadlo.
He had to tell no one.	Wuxuu ahaa inuu qofna u sheego.
It was something like him.	Waxay ahayd wax isaga oo kale ah.
I have to	waa inaan haysto
I am not sure	Ma hubo
You will do what he says.	Waxaad samayn doontaa wuxuu yidhi.
It is enough and not a little more.	Waa ku filan tahay oo in yar oo kale maaha.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
Nobody.	Qofna .
Let me know.	Aan ogaado.
give me some.	xoogaa i sii.
Only work.	Kaliya shaqo.
And, you can do nothing.	Oo, waxba kama qaban kartid.
She could not believe what had just happened.	Way rumaysan wayday waxa hadda dhacay.
I love it here.	Waan jeclahay halkan.
I just didn’t get it.	Kaliya maan helin.
This is rejected.	Tani waa la diiday.
But it was never found.	Laakiin waligiis lama helin.
But then he decided to get it.	Laakiin ka dib wuxuu go'aansaday inuu helo.
I would do anything	wax walba waan samayn lahaa
I want to work	Waxaan rabaa inaan shaqeeyo
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
I wanted it hard	Waxaan rabay adag
I am happy here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay halkan.
She will always succeed.	Had iyo jeer way guulaysan doontaa.
Like that they didn't even see me.	Sida in aanay xitaa i arag.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
I was a little.	Waxaan ahaa wax yar.
Not desirable.	Ma aha la jecel yahay.
And it is not.	Oo ma aha.
But none of us know what tomorrow will be.	Laakiin mid naga mid ah ma garanayo waxa berri ay tahay.
It can be very good.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
They will be food.	Waxay ahaan doonaan cunto.
Maybe it was bad.	Malaha wuxuu ahaa mid xun.
He does not want to be friends with everyone.	Ma rabo inuu qof walba la saaxiibo.
There isn’t much.	Ma jiraan wax aad u badan.
Maybe buy it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu iibsado.
That's what drives it all.	Taasi waa waxa tan wada.
I think you can do this and do it well.	Waxaan filayaa inaad tan samayn karto oo aad si fiican u samayn karto.
I came in.	waan soo galay.
What happened.	Maxaa dhacay.
No wonder, there.	La yaab ma leh, halkaas.
He has to go.	Waa inuu tago.
I really wanted to buy it.	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan iibsado.
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
I can only do so much.	Kaliya wax badan ayaan qaban karaa.
I would like something to eat	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa wax aan cuno
It's really good.	Runtii way fiican tahay.
They are happy and excited.	Way faraxsan yihiin oo way faraxsan yihiin.
It is stated here.	Waxaa lagu sheegay halkan.
Whatever he did.	Wax kasta oo uu sameeyay.
This should not be too difficult.	Tani waa inaysan noqon mid aad u adag.
I think you want something similar.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad rabto wax la mid ah.
To be the best he can be.	Si uu u noqdo kan ugu wanaagsan ee uu noqon karo.
Don't tell anyone.	Cidna ha u sheegin.
I will always love you.	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa.
Now she loves it.	Hadda way jeceshahay.
It will be so.	Way ahaan doontaa sidaas.
I may not mention it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan sheegin.
This is also not popular.	Tani sidoo kale ma aha mid la jecel yahay.
What it is, and how it is held.	Waa maxay, iyo sida loo haysto.
Maybe it would be a little after all.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uu noqon lahaa wax yar ka dib oo dhan.
No one went, no one came.	Qofna ma tagin, qofna ma iman.
It was a difficult time, for sure.	Waxay ahayd waqti adag, hubaal.
He took it to the door.	Albaabka ayuu u qaaday.
Please let me know if this would be correct.	Fadlan ii sheeg haddii ay tani sax noqon lahayd.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
I have always been so.	Had iyo jeer sidaas ayaan ahaa.
Here he is, man.	Waa kan uu yahay, nin.
Like there is nothing else she can do.	Sida ma jirto wax kale oo ay samayn karto.
What a great idea.	Waa maxay fikrad fiican.
This was amazing.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad yaab leh.
I have new friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo cusub.
I owe you everything.	Wax walba waan kugu leeyahay.
I couldn’t imagine tonight.	Ma malayn karin caawa.
He has to stay home.	Waa inuu guriga joogo.
Both are correct.	Labaduba waa sax.
This is the same as most.	Tani waxay la mid tahay inta badan.
And here it is again.	Oo halkan waa mar kale.
It has not been found elsewhere	Meel kale waa laga waayay
Tell you something.	Wax kuu sheeg.
No problem.	Dhib ma lahayn.
I think they are great.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay weyn yihiin.
This will be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
That is what we can do.	Taasi waa waxa aan sameyn karno.
But there is a lot going on.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo socda.
I am not difficult.	Ma ihi mid adag.
He started again again.	Mar kale ayuu hore u bilaabay.
I hope someone helps.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay qof caawiso.
Today, he knows better.	Maanta, si fiican ayuu u yaqaan.
Tom was great.	Tom wuxuu ahaa mid weyn.
How is it said.	Sidee baa loo yidhi.
So much so.	Sidaas aad u badan.
It was very close.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
Not available.	Lama heli karo.
He looked back at me.	Dib ayuu ii eegay.
No one can do it all.	Qofna ma wada samayn karo.
That is a good thing for the rest.	Taasi waa wax u wanaagsan inta kale.
Just to know they are not.	Kaliya si aad u ogaato inaysan ahayn.
He could not lie.	Been wuu sheegi waayay.
A beautiful and truly handsome man.	Nin qurux badan oo dhab ah.
I will not lie.	Been sheegi maayo.
You can make a lot of money there.	Waxaad halkaas ka samayn kartaa lacag badan.
Definitely good to see you too.	Waa hubaal inay wanaagsan tahay inaan ku arko sidoo kale.
He really didn't understand.	Runtii ma uu fahmin.
No problem	Dhib ma rabo
You are beautiful, as always.	Waad qurux badan tahay, sida had iyo jeer.
I have no idea where.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo meesha.
I am not here for that.	Anigu halkan uma joogo taas.
He knows how to do this.	Wuu yaqaan sida tan loo sameeyo.
They did not say.	Ma ay odhan.
Needed now more than ever.	Loo baahan yahay hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
It was enough.	Waxay ahayd ku filan.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
He should not have been here.	Ma ahayn inuu halkan joogo.
This was also true.	Tani sidoo kale run bay ahayd.
She really loves you.	Runtii way ku jeceshahay .
It is enough for him.	Waa ku filan tahay isaga.
Now they are too many.	Hadda aad bay u badan yihiin.
That is why it cannot be spoken.	Taasi waa sababta aan loo hadli karin.
This can take a long time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer.
But now they will get it.	Laakiin hadda way heli doonaan.
For you, more.	Adiga, wax ka badan.
you are a bad person.	waxaad tahay qof xun.
I have to tell you.	Waa inaan kuu sheego.
I still don't know.	Wali ma garanayo.
Not all the time.	Ma aha wakhti kasta.
But I must.	Laakiin waa in aan.
I love how it looks	Waxaan jeclahay sida ay u egtahay
Something else happened.	Wax kale ayaa dhacay.
Which is probably a good thing.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay tahay wax wanaagsan.
I wanted to see you again.	Waxaan rabay inaan mar kale ku arko.
It was so beautiful and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan oo qurux badan.
Maybe you do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sameyso.
Otherwise, that was it.	Haddii kale, taasi waxay ahayd.
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
You friend.	Adiga saaxiib.
I can't do it with anyone else.	Ma samayn karo qof kale.
But still, we are the same.	Laakiin weli, waan la mid nahay.
I'm really scared of you.	Runtii waan kaa baqayaa.
I know it's hard.	Waan ogahay inuu adag yahay.
It's the same as before.	Waa la mid sidii hore.
It would come back one day.	Waxay soo noqon lahayd maalin.
They did not know that.	Ma ay ogayn taas.
If she does.	Haddii ay sameyso.
I looked and everything.	Waan eegay iyo wax walba.
You can access it anytime and anywhere.	Waxaad heli kartaa wakhti kasta iyo meel kasta.
Maybe they like it too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidaas oo kale jecel yihiin.
I know, it's not smart.	Waan ogahay, ma caqli badna.
I had no money.	Lacag ma haysan.
There is no urgency here.	Ma jiro wax degdeg ah halkan.
All is correct again.	Dhammaan waa sax mar kale.
I thought it would stop.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay joojin doonto.
What is being kept?	Maxaa la hayaa?.
I won't say much.	Wax badan ma odhan doono.
Nothing is clear.	Wax cad ma jiro.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay.
There was so much to do.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo la samayn lahaa.
Very surprising to me.	Aad ii yaab badan.
What, not who.	Waa maxay, maaha yaa.
I thought it could happen.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay dhici karto.
It looks like it will do the job well.	Waxay u egtahay inay si fiican u qaban doonto shaqada.
That's what he has.	Waa waxa uu haysto.
He looked at me.	Wuu i eegay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Here's how to do it	Waa kan sida aad u sameyso
I have to go	Waa inaan tago
Just take it.	Kaliya qaado.
Me and you, and everyone.	Aniga iyo adiga, iyo qof walba.
But that could be it.	Laakiin taasi waxay noqon kartaa.
There was something he did.	Waxaa jiray wax uu sameeyo.
I told you that.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegay.
Maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in laga yaabo.
This is really to be expected.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa la filayaa.
Will and you will receive.	Doono oo waad heli doontaa.
But not tomorrow.	Laakiin berri maaha.
At the same time every day.	Waqti isku mid ah maalin kasta.
I can see it now.	hadda waan arki karaa .
He was having a hard time.	Waxa uu ku jiray waqti adag.
At first, it was true.	Marka hore, run bay ahayd.
But very good.	Laakiin aad u wanaagsan.
No one really wants to know.	Qofna runtii ma rabo inuu ogaado.
I am happy here now.	Waan ku faraxsanahay halkan hadda.
Beautiful, beautiful! ' 	Qurux, qurux badan!'
Let me tell you, it was.	Aan kuu sheego, waa.
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan ku arko berri
It's smart !.	Waa caqli badan tahay!.
Nothing will happen to me.	Waxba igu dhici maayo.
Nothing, maybe.	Waxba malaha, malaha.
He really felt it.	Runtii aad ayuu u dareemay.
I am one man.	Waxaan ahay hal nin.
I want it now	hadda waan rabaa
I think that's right.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ay sax tahay.
But that is a very bad idea.	Laakiin taasi waa fikrad aad u xun.
I knew he could.	Waan ogaa inuu awoodo.
It's hard to do.	Way adag tahay in la sameeyo.
They are really better.	Runtii way ka fiican yihiin.
He was not.	Ma uusan ahayn.
She looks like him.	Waxay u egtahay isaga oo kale.
But I will not go there.	Laakiin ma aadi doono halkaas.
But no one can fall.	Laakiin qofna ma dhici karo.
That was as it was.	Taasi waxay ahayd sidii ay ahayd.
This is my new favorite.	Tani waa kan cusub ee aan jeclahay.
It is unbelievable.	Waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
Very well done.	Aad ayaa loo sameeyay.
It's amazing! 	Waa yaab!
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
It can't last long.	Ma sii joogi karto wakhti dheer.
I always had one friend.	Had iyo jeer waxaan lahaa hal saaxiib.
That is, it no longer exists.	Taasi waa, mar dambe ma jirto.
But, you know.	Laakiin, waad ogtahay.
I did a lot at school.	Wax badan ayaan dugsiga ku sameeyay.
This is not to be found.	Tani ma aha in la helo.
Not that he is not a good man.	Ma ahan in uusan ahayn nin wanaagsan.
In fact, like nothing.	Dhab ahaantii, sida waxba.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
He looked at me, long and good.	Wuu i eegay, wakhti dheer oo wanaagsan.
I wondered why.	Waxaan la yaabay sababta.
I will need it.	Waan u baahan doonaa.
It really doesn't work.	Runtii ma shaqeeyo.
This was more fun than it was.	Tani waxay ahayd mid ka xiiso badan sidii ay ahayd.
I would love to be with you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula joogo.
It may still be.	Wali waa laga yaabaa.
He looked from a distance.	Meel dheer buu ka eegay.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I don't have much to say.	Wax badan oo aan sheego ma hayo.
You should not say so.	Waa inaadan sidaas u hadlin.
I am, in fact, very much like you.	Anigu, runtii, aad ayaan adiga kula mid ahay.
But there was no aftermath.	Laakiin ma jirin ka dib.
I just didn’t like it.	Kaliya ma jeclayn.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
Like, the best he knows.	Sida, sida ugu fiican ee uu u yaqaan.
Everyone is really, really good.	Qof walba runtii, runtii wuu fiican yahay.
available	laga heli karo
He is smarter than I am now.	Hadda wuu iga caqli badan yahay.
We do not do well.	Wax si fiican uma samayno.
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
I felt	waan dhacay
This is how it looks.	Tani waa sida ay u egtahay.
I can no longer speak.	Mar dambe ma hadli karo.
My favorite place.	Meel aan ugu jeclahay.
It was really beautiful.	Runtii waxay ahayd qurux.
I will not tell you again.	Mar dambe kuu sheegi maayo.
We will be friends.	Waxaan noqon doonaa saaxiibo.
I could not.	Maan awoodin.
I did not know this.	Ma ogayn tan.
That is how it always is.	Taasi waa sida uu mar walba yahay.
He is expected to find out.	Waxaa laga filayaa inuu ogaado.
It may not be very beautiful.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn mid aad qurux badan.
He didn’t get much opportunity.	Ma uusan helin fursad badan.
A day later.	Maalin ka dib.
One day they will be here a lot.	Maalin waxay halkan u joogi doonaan wax badan.
But he was.	Laakiin wuxuu ahaa.
No one should leave.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu baxo.
Not as you were.	Ma aha sida aad ahayd.
I did, too.	Waxaan sameeyay, sidoo kale.
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
That will not be a complete lie.	Taasi been dhan ma noqon doonto.
She didn't want to do anything.	Ma rabin inay wax samayso.
You should not say so.	Waa inaadan sidaas odhan.
That was another day.	Taasi waxay ahayd maalin kale.
I appeared at the door.	Waxaan ka soo muuqday albaabka.
More than a surprise.	In ka badan yaab.
I hope you will.	Waxaan filayaa inaad yeeli doonto.
It may be beautiful.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay qurux badan tahay.
No one wants to do anything to you.	Qofna ma rabo inuu wax ku sameeyo.
This is very good.	Tani aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
But that would be it.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahaan lahayd.
Too much, really.	Aad u badan, runtii.
I didn’t have time.	Ma haysan waqti.
We can't find anything.	Waxba ma heli karno.
It's a bad thing.	Waa wax xun.
This is what we are doing now.	Tani waa waxa aan hadda samayno.
There is nothing more exciting.	Wax aad u xiiso badan ma jiraan.
And so, that's true.	Iyo si, taasi waa run.
Everything is fine now.	Wax walba hadda way fiican yihiin.
Very little money.	Lacag aad u yar.
But it was not.	Laakiin ma ay ahayn.
Not sure now.	Ma hubo hadda.
I didn't have the right job.	Maan lahayn shaqo sax ah.
I promise you this.	Tan ayaan kuu ballan qaaday.
Don't like it	Ha jeclayn
I'll talk about it tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
To say more.	In aan wax badan sheego.
I can very much believe that.	Aad baan u rumaysan karaa taas.
This is only once.	Tani waa hal mar oo kaliya.
There is no such thing.	Qof sidaas oo kale ah ma jiro.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga.
This will be a big problem for me.	Tani waxay igu noqon doontaa dhibaato weyn.
I would always get out of there quickly.	Had iyo jeer si degdeg ah ayaan halkaas uga soo bixi lahaa.
I did not have a car.	Maan lahayn baabuur.
That is amazing.	Taasi waa yaab.
I didn't get it.	Ma helin.
Everything.	Wax walba.
Sorry, that's the way it is.	Waan ka xumahay, waa sida ay tahay.
Maybe he is.	Malaha wuu yahay.
People who have been at work for a long time.	Dadka shaqada ku jira muddo dheer.
Like everyone else, we were surprised.	Sida dadka kale, waxaa nala yaabay.
She will have more time to do that.	Waxay heli doontaa wakhti badan oo ay taas ku samayso.
I really hope so.	Runtii taas aad baan u rajeynayaa.
It can help	Way ku caawin kartaa
Everything is new, everything is fun.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin, wax walba waa xiiso leh.
I don't mind that.	Dhib uma arko taas.
There is always time.	Mar walba wakhti baa jira.
He loves to know how to do things.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu ogaado sida wax loo sameeyo.
You can only go by car.	Waxaad kaliya u tagi kartaa baabuur.
But it is very good.	Laakiin aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I'll tell you why.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa sababta.
But it can be very true.	Laakiin aad bay run u noqon kartaa.
You can't do this.	Ma samayn kartid tan.
Something else came up.	Wax kale ayaa ku soo baxay.
In fact, they should not take much time.	Dhab ahaantii, waa inaysan qaadan waqti badan.
But this will not do either.	Laakiin tani sidoo kale ma yeeli doonto.
There was no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma uusan jirin.
Either way he said.	Si kasta oo uu yidhi.
One like him.	Mid isaga la mid ah.
He must have been with him.	Waa inuu la lahaa isaga.
She refused.	Way diiday.
But there is more difficulty.	Laakiin waxaa jira dhib badan.
Otherwise do nothing.	Haddii kale waxba ha samayn.
That will come again.	Taas mar kale ayaan iman doonaa.
Can anyone help?	Qof ma caawin karaa?.
I can see it all.	Waan arki karaa dhammaan.
He is good at that.	Taas wuu ku fiican yahay.
I will do my best for you.	Waxaan kuu samayn doonaa waxa ugu fiican ee aan awoodo.
He is a smart, smart man.	Waa nin caqli badan, caqli badan.
It has always been me.	Had iyo jeer aniga ayaa ahaan jiray.
But this will not help.	Laakiin tani ma caawin doonto.
The door? 	Albaabka?
Someone must have told me.	Waa in qof ii sheegay .
Is jecel.	Is jecel.
Home too late	Guriga aad goor dambe
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd weyn.
I hope you will find everything you need.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad heli doonto wax walba oo aad u baahan tahay.
He said he loves being there.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu jecel yahay halkaas.
I really don't like this.	Runtii tan ma jecli.
That I will come tomorrow.	Taas berrito ayaan iman doonaa.
You look beautiful.	Waxaad u egtahay qurux.
This cannot be good.	Tani ma noqon karto mid wanaagsan.
It would be nice to leave now.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd inaan hadda baxo.
Not surprisingly at best.	Aan la yaab lahayn marka ugu fiican.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
That is what it is, really.	Taasi waa waxa ay tahay, runtii.
She says so.	Waxay leedahay sidaas.
I really like it.	Runtii aad ayaan u jeclahay.
You, obviously, are much less than that.	Adiga, si cad, aad ayaad uga yar tahay taas.
Nice to be with you !.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad nala joogto!.
It would be a lot of work and nothing.	Waxay noqon lahayd shaqo badan oo aan waxba ahayn.
There was someone else, there was always someone else.	Waxaa jiray qof kale, mar walba waxaa jiray qof kale.
Which is more likely.	Taas oo ay u badan tahay.
I was not ready for this now.	Hadda diyaar uma ahayn arrintan.
There was no urgency.	Degdeg ma jirin.
There was nothing surprising.	Ma jirin wax la yaab leh.
I just didn’t get it.	Kaliya ma helin.
It is clear.	Waa cad.
I saw it all.	Waan wada arkay.
This was difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid adag.
I hope to talk to you soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan dhawaan kula hadlo.
There is so much more than that.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo ka badan taas.
Little and the rest.	Yar iyo inta kale.
If they don't, you don't have to.	Haddii aysan haysan, uma baahnid.
They did not do this.	Ma ay samayn tan.
I think that's good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi fiican tahay.
is available	waa la heli karaa
But obviously I did not understand that.	Laakiin sida iska cad ma fahmin taas.
This is what he should be in prison for.	Waa kan ay tahay inuu xabsiga ku jiro.
Great man.	Nin weyn.
It's beautiful here	Waa qurux halkan
It will not go away.	Ma bixi doonto.
I don't work regularly.	Si joogto ah uma shaqeeyo.
I would only stay once.	Hal mar oo kaliya ayaan joogi lahaa.
What's up? 	Maxaa ka jira?
He looked at him.	Isaga eegay.
Just stop.	Kaliya jooji.
Now he says all the time.	Hadda wuu sheegay mar walba.
Please do not let anyone tell you otherwise.	Fadlan ha u ogolaan qofna inuu si kale kuu sheego.
It's a fun, great place.	Waa meel xiiso badan, aad u weyn.
Don't do it again.	Mar dambe ha samayn.
First it is correct	Marka hore waa sax
I'm sure it was.	Waan hubaa inay ahayd.
Anytime, anywhere, anyway.	Waqti kasta, meel kasta, si kasta.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
It does not have to be done.	Ma aha in lagu sameeyo.
They have not been there for a long time.	Muddo dheer ma ay joogin.
I do not understand.	Anigu ma fahmin.
Everyone always told me to be like him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu had iyo jeer ii sheegi jiray inaan isaga oo kale noqdo.
Less.	Wax ka yar .
I don't want to.	Ma rabto.
He was with her.	Wuu la joogay.
There is no way you can imagine it now.	Ma jirto si aad hadda u malayn karto.
It should not exist.	Waa inaysan jirin.
I will go somewhere else.	Meel kale ayaan aadi doonaa.
This was alive.	Tani waxay ahayd mid nool.
They contain something.	Wax bay ku jiraan.
I will say it again.	Mar kale ayaan odhan doonaa.
He will be here for a while	Wax yar ayuu halkan joogi doonaa
Probably true.	Waxay u badan tahay run.
Maybe it's just me.	Malaha waa aniga oo kaliya.
He tried to do it.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu sameeyo.
I would like to know him.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ogaado isaga.
To help others.	Si loo caawiyo dadka kale.
Now it has arrived	Hadda ayaa soo galay
Another was at home with you.	Mid kale ayaa guriga kula jiray.
Someone really had to talk about him.	Qof run ahaantii waxay ahayd inuu ka hadlo isaga.
I tried to talk to him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la hadlo.
Also, it is always available if you need something.	Sidoo kale, had iyo jeer waa la heli karaa haddii aad u baahan tahay wax.
But nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale ma jiraan.
I hope you will like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto.
I'm not sure if he sees me or not.	Ma hubo inuu i arko iyo in kale.
It must be seen.	Waa in la arko.
All the better, but it was amazing.	Dhammaan si ka wanaagsan, laakiin waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Maybe now is the time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hadda tahay waqti.
This may not be correct.	Tani sax ma noqon karto.
I got this.	tan waan helay.
John said a little.	Yooxanaa wuxuu yidhi wax yar.
I never understood this.	Weligay tan ma fahmin.
Like, not all.	Sida, ma aha dhammaan.
It will not go away.	Ma bixi doonto.
I hear.	waan maqlay.
So far nothing surprising.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax la yaab leh.
I like	waan jeclahay
But I don't know how to do that.	Laakiin ma garanayo sida loo sameeyo taas.
I would get a bigger one now.	Waxaan hadda heli lahaa mid ka weyn.
Everyone loves us.	Qof walba waa na jecel yahay.
Everyone you were was great.	Qof kasta oo aad ahayd ayaa weyn.
You can't do this.	Ma samayn kartid tan.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
They probably didn't know he was there.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan ogeyn inuu halkaas joogo.
She told him she couldn't stop.	Waxay u sheegtay inaysan joojin karin.
Like, really.	Sida, dhab ahaantii.
It was a beautiful place.	Waxay ahayd meel qurux badan.
I can be the same.	Waxaan noqon karaa isku mid.
.	.
But this is a lie.	Laakiin tani waa been.
He may not have seen it before.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanu hore u arag.
I can leave.	Waan ka bixi karaa.
That is the only thing you really need to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad runtii u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
I became a little better here.	Waxaan noqday qof halkan ka yara wanaagsan.
Something big is going to happen.	Wax weyn ayaa dhici doona.
I need it back.	Waxaan u baahanahay dib.
There is for sure.	Wax hubaal ah ayaa jira.
That was a very good idea.	Taasi waxay ahayd fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
For one thing, everyone knows the house.	Mid ka mid ah, qof kastaa wuu yaqaan guriga.
She says.	Waxay leedahay .
I did that.	Taas waan sameeyay.
I don't know much.	Wax badan kama garanayo.
It really is true.	Runtii waa run.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I entered late.	Waxaan galay goor dambe.
She would leave, he knew that.	Way ka tagi lahayd, wuu ogaa taas.
You can even be friends.	Xitaa waxaad noqon kartaa saaxiibo.
Please can you help me work on it.	Fadlan ma iga caawin kartaa inaan ka shaqeeyo.
They may not really know what else is going on there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aysan si dhab ah u garanayn waxa kale oo halkaas ka jira.
John came in	John ayaa soo galay
I can’t really take this.	Si dhab ah uma qaadan karo tan.
Not sure now.	Ma hubo hadda.
I want you now	hadda waan ku rabaa
This is really a lot.	Tani runtii waa wax badan.
First, he said.	Marka hore, ayuu yidhi.
That is very rare.	Taasi aad bay u yar tahay.
That, and something else.	Taas, iyo wax kale.
But this is not always the case.	Laakiin mar walba sidaas maaha.
You will find one happy.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa mid ku faraxsan.
I'm sure it's just a little bit.	Waxaan hubaa inay tahay wax yar oo kaliya.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Indeed, it has been observed.	Runtii, waa la arkay.
In fact, that is surprising.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa yaab.
Bigger and better.	Ka weyn oo ka wanaagsan.
No one wanted to.	Qofna ma rabin.
And again and again and again.	Oo mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale.
Great place, close to everything you need.	Meel aad u fiican, oo u dhow wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay.
There is no way to do it.	Ma jiro si loo sameeyo.
It doesn't look real.	Wax dhab ah uma eka.
That was not long ago.	Taasi ma ahayn wakhti dheer ka hor.
That really was.	Taasi runtii waxay ahayd.
It really seems like a big deal to me.	Runtii waxay ila tahay wax weyn.
She would love that.	Way jeclaan lahayd taas .
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
But you do not want to be here.	Laakiin ma rabto inaad halkan joogto.
I do	waan sameeyaa
That’s why they do what they do.	Taasi waa sababta ay u sameeyaan waxay sameeyaan.
Good day friend.	Maalin wanaagsan saaxiib.
It is often unnecessary.	Inta badan waa wax aan loo baahnayn.
What I think.	Waxa aan u malaynayo.
This does not do so.	Tani ma samaynayso sidaas.
But he will leave soon.	Laakiin dhawaan wuu bixi doonaa.
He took it and did nothing.	Wuu qaatay oo waxba ma samayn.
Another obvious lie.	Been kale oo cad.
Sure, hard.	Hubaal, adag.
What does he do now.	Muxuu hadda sameeyaa.
I don't have to do that.	Ma aha inaan sidaas samaynayo.
He used to be.	Wuxuu ahaan jiray.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
He was here, but he had to leave.	Wuu joogay halkan, laakiin waa inuu ka tago.
He told me.	Wuxuu igu yidhi .
This is well promised.	Tani waxay si fiican u ballan qaaday.
The rest.	Inta kale.
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
Do not leave the room.	Qolka ha ka bixin.
He knows that no one is here.	Wuu ogyahay in aanay halkan cidna ahayn.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
Nice and good, but no more.	Si fiican oo wanaagsan, laakiin mar dambe ma jirto.
They will see us.	Way na arki doonaan.
So far, so good.	Ilaa hadda, aad u fiican.
They are great.	Way weyn yihiin.
It was the best thing we could do.	Waxay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan ee aan sameyn karno.
That may not be true.	Taasi run ma noqon karto.
He knew what he needed.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu u baahan yahay.
There really is no such thing.	Runtii ma jiro wax la mid ah.
Maybe this is a big deal.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani ay tahay wax weyn.
She did not want him to come.	Ma ay rabin inuu yimaado.
He should never have said that.	Ma ahayn in uu sidaas oo kale waligiis odhan.
It's a little difficult.	Way yara adag tahay.
You can get that much new.	Waxaad taas ku heli kartaa wax badan oo cusub.
That is all that is needed.	Taasi waa waxa loo baahan yahay oo dhan.
It’s like everything else.	Waa sida wax kasta oo kale.
But it was fun every day.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh maalin kasta.
No one wants to go first.	Qofna ma rabo inuu marka hore tago.
It is not something we can do.	Ma ahan wax aan sameyn karno.
It's really good.	Runtii waa wax wanaagsan.
I got in there.	Halkaas ayaan ka galay.
Someone really great.	Qof run ahaantii weyn.
I have to learn to be again.	Waa inaan mar kale barto inaan noqdo.
He wanted a little.	Wax yar buu rabay.
How would she come home.	Sidee bay guriga ku iman lahayd.
It sounds complicated	Waxay u egtahay mid adag
No one wanted to tell him.	Ma jirin qof uu rabo inuu u sheego.
I hope it will get better over time.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiicnaan doonto muddo ka dib.
It was as it were said.	Waxay ahayd sidii loo yidhi.
This money.	Tan lacag ah.
Although not for long.	In kasta oo aanay muddo dheer ahayn.
He was not alone here.	Keligiis ma ahayn halkan.
Maybe, right now, it doesn’t exist now.	Malaha, hadda, hadda ma jirto.
Very well done.	Aad ayaa loo sameeyay.
It was unbelievable to me.	Waxay ii ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
I know what to do.	Waan ogahay waxa ay tahay in la sameeyo.
The former is urgent.	Kan hore waa degdeg.
That was right, beautiful indeed.	Taasi sax bay ahayd, qurux run ahaantii.
But no one knew.	Laakiin qofna ma ogayn.
Don't do that.	Ha samayn taas.
Everyone was surprised I was not included.	Qof kastaa waa uu la yaabay isaga oo aan ku jiro.
Maybe he had the right idea.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu lahaa fikrad sax ah.
He was serious again.	Mar kale ayuu dhab ka ahaa.
For me, you were a friend.	Aniga, waxaad ahayd saaxiib.
That's right, you know.	Waa sax, waad ogtahay.
Soon everything will be fine.	Mar dhow wax walba sax bay noqon doonaan.
You will help me.	Waad i caawin doontaa.
There is so much in it.	Wax badan baa ku jira.
Tough, but ready.	Adag, laakiin diyaar ah.
I do not care? 	Maxaa iga galay?
He is still there.	Weli wuu joogaa.
Everything is so beautiful.	Wax walba oo aad u qurux badan.
They will help us.	Way na caawin doonaan.
It was horrible.	Waxay ahayd mid xun xun.
I am in, if you will find me.	Waan ku jiraa, haddii aad i heli doonto.
Where he came from.	Halka uu ka yimid.
Probably the least.	Malaha ugu yar.
He knew nothing of that.	Taas waxba kama uu ogayn.
But that would be nice.	Laakiin taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
Both are included.	Labaduba way ku jiraan.
I do not do that.	Taas ma sameeyo.
I could not.	Waan awoodi waayay.
I thought that was it.	Waxa aan u maleeyay in ay taasi tahay.
It was rejected.	Waa loo diiday.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
It really is true.	Runtii waa run.
There is not much new.	Wax badan oo cusub ma jiraan.
There is also no better place.	Sidoo kale ma jirto meel ka fiican.
You can, friend.	Waad sameyn kartaa, saaxiib.
I no longer liked it.	Mar dambe ma jeclayn.
I know you are taller than me.	Waan ogahay inaad iga dheer tahay.
He knew he was close.	Wuu ogaa inuu u dhow yahay.
I really wanted that.	Runtii taas ayaan rabay.
It doesn't look right.	Wax sax ah uma eka.
Give me time.	Waqti i sii.
It was at the same time.	Waxay ahayd isku mar.
But she knows this is not true.	Laakiin way ogtahay in tani aanay run ahayn.
I don't have time for this right now.	Waqti uma hayo kan hadda.
Try hard.	Si adag isku dayay.
He told her.	Wuxuu u sheegay in ay.
There is certainly no problem in doing so.	Hubaal dhib ma leh in sidaas la sameeyo.
It is not clear where they will go.	Lama hubo halka ay aadi doonaan.
They will get better.	Way fiicnaan doonaan.
Very smart, really.	Aad u caqli badan, runtii.
Where he was.	Meesha uu joogay.
Everyone knows everything.	Qof kastaa waa ogyahay wax walba.
Give us a little.	Wax yar na sii.
It was probably a good thing he did.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay wax wanaagsan oo uu sameeyay.
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
I'm just surprised, you know.	Kaliya waan yaabay, waad ogtahay.
I looked again.	Mar kale ayaan eegay.
I want to work with people.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la shaqeeyo dadka.
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
This is beautiful.	Tani waa qurux badan.
Otherwise it will not be interesting.	Haddii kale ma noqon doonto wax xiiso leh.
I hope she did well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay wax wanaagsan samaysay.
I think she would say a lot to you.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in ay wax badan oo ay kugu odhan lahayd.
I will definitely do it.	Runtii waan yeeli doonaa.
Maybe they are.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay yihiin.
If we could do that it would be great.	Haddii aan taas samayn karno way fiicnaan lahayd.
I really won’t be able to tell you.	Runtii ma awoodi doono inaan kuu sheego.
If he tried something, he was unlucky.	Haddii uu wax isku dayay, nasiib buu ka baxay.
This was a coincidence and nothing else.	Tani waxay ahayd wax iska yimid oo wax kale ma jiraan.
Like, everyone is happy.	Sida, dhammaan waa faraxsan yihiin.
I don't want to be friends.	Ma doonayo in aan saaxiibo.
Not him, not now.	Isaga maaha, hadda maaha.
But obviously there is the same.	Laakiin sida iska cad waxaa jira isku mid.
I can't find a job	Ma heli karo shaqo
I am very happy to have come out.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay soo baxay.
He could not tell.	Wuu u sheegi waayay.
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
You really.	Adiga runtii .
Whatever she needs.	Wax kasta oo ay u baahan tahay.
But that is not certain.	Laakiin taasi lama hubo.
They may be bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xun yihiin.
I picked one up.	Mid baan soo qaaday.
That can be anything.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta.
I think they will do the same.	Waxaan filayaa inay sidaas oo kale samayn doonaan.
But even there, a little was right.	Laakiin xitaa halkaas, wax yar ayaa sax ahaa.
We can't see what's coming.	Ma arki karno waxa soo socda.
He asked.	Waxa uu waydiiyay.
Really, a lot.	Runtii, aad u badan.
That is difficult.	Taasi waa adag tahay.
Amazing man, good man, but a real man.	Nin la yaab leh, nin fiican, laakiin nin dhab ah.
I have beautiful friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo qurux badan.
You can do the same if you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa sidaas oo kale haddii aad rabto.
I want you to tell me what happened.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ii sheegto waxa dhacay.
I asked to see.	Waxaan codsaday inaan arko.
No one knew who he was.	Qofna ma garanayn cidda uu yahay.
Everywhere is better here.	Meel kasta ayaa ka fiican halkan.
We can't go any further.	In ka badan ma aadi karno.
Tell them all.	U sheeg dhammaan.
I'm not really sure how he did that.	Runtii ma hubo sida uu taas u sameeyay.
I did a lot.	Waxaan sameeyay wax badan.
I don't know where to go.	Ma garanayo meel aan aado.
But he knew they would never love him again.	Laakiin wuu ogaa in aanay dib dambe u jeclaan doonin.
He has to go to work.	Waa inuu shaqo tago.
Good job received.	Shaqo fiican oo la helay.
That was also something she did.	Taasi waxay sidoo kale ahayd wax ay samaysay.
But that was as it was.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd sidii ay ahayd.
We need her to help us.	Waxaan u baahanahay inay na caawiso.
To do it right.	Si sax ah loo sameeyo.
That is what you have to do.	Taas oo ah in aad sameyso.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Now I have seen.	Hadda ayaan arkay.
I'm sorry, but it's true.	Waan ka xumahay, laakiin waa run.
He knows, it has to be right.	Wuu garanayaa, waa inay sax tahay.
Hard, and very long.	Adag, iyo waqti aad u dheer.
No one.	Qofna ma aha.
Please tell me.	Fadlan ii sheeg.
You are one very good friend.	Waxaad tahay hal saaxiib oo aad u wanaagsan.
Someone we don't know.	Qof aanu garanayn.
It was the smallest place.	Waxay ahayd meesha ugu yar.
But there is something.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax.
He needs you.	Wuu kuu baahan yahay.
It was amazing to find a place.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh in meel la helo.
He did everything to get everything.	Wuxuu sameeyay wax walba si uu wax walba u helo.
But always me.	Laakiin had iyo jeer aniga.
He had to find out why.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado sababta.
I think he did well tonight.	Waxaan filayaa inuu caawa sameeyay wax fiican.
You really don't want to do this.	Runtii ma rabto inaad tan samayso.
I hope it will happen.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay dhici doonto.
As if he had to do something.	Sida haddii ay tahay inuu wax samaynayo.
It was supposed to be very interesting.	Waxay ahayd inay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
It always is.	Had iyo jeer waa.
I want to talk to you	waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
I'm not sure if that would be good.	Ma hubo inay taasi fiicnaan lahayd iyo in kale.
I'll talk about it again.	Dib ayaan uga hadli doonaa mar kale.
I was surprised.	Waxaan la yaabay.
We were all together.	Waanu wada ahayn.
I think it could be.	Waxaan filayaa inay noqon karto.
After all, it wasn’t.	Ka dib, ma ahayn.
It is hard to eat at home.	Way adag tahay in guriga lagu cuno.
It was too late.	Waxay ahayd goor dambe.
It was for sure.	Waxay ahayd hubaal.
But that will happen.	Laakiin taasi way dhici doontaa.
Which is what we do here.	Taas oo ah waxa aanu halkan ku samayn.
It's just an idea.	Waa fikrad kaliya.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
Whatever you want.	Wax kasta oo aad rabto.
he would help us.	wuu na caawin lahaa.
I had to stay.	Waxay ahayd inaan ku sii jiro.
But, it is not.	Laakiin, maaha.
Maybe more than one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan hal.
It is certain that he will be fired.	Waa hubaal in shaqada laga joojin doono.
I don’t have to say how much she loves me.	Ma aha inaan sheego sida ay ii jeceshahay.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I love that.	Waan ku jeclahay taas.
But what is it.	Laakiin waa maxay.
It didn't matter how.	Dhib ma lahayn sida.
But you will be fine.	Laakiin waad fiicnaan doontaa.
She will not be able to do it.	Ma awoodi doonto inay sameyso.
But it is not.	Laakiin maaha.
I'll do it here	Waxaan ka qaban doonaa halkan
There was little.	Wax yar baa jiray.
Please tell me what to do.	Fadlan ii sheeg waxa aan sameeyo.
I hope you like it too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidoo kale jeceshahay.
He looked good.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid fiican.
I hope he has enough time to do that.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu ku jiro waqti ku filan inuu taas sameeyo.
It was no small feat.	Ma ahayn wax yar.
They are all still fine.	Weli dhammaan way wanaagsan yihiin.
I looked at that first.	Taas ayaan eegay markii hore.
I wonder what happened to me.	Waxaan la yaabanahay maxaa igu dhacay.
Do not leave alone.	Keligaa ha bixin.
One might say that.	Mid ayaa laga yaabaa inuu taas ku sheego.
She should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inay si fiican u ogaato.
That would be great.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd mid aad u fiican.
I know you would like that.	Waan ogahay inaad taas jeclaan lahayd.
They had no more money.	Lacag dambe ma ay haysan.
All your favorite.	Dhammaan wixii aad jeceshahay.
He must leave.	Waa inuu ka tago.
She did not want to see him.	Ma ay rabin inuu arko.
I'll see you there	Waan ku arki doonaa halkaas
Have trouble.	Dhib ku qabo.
She could see nothing else.	Wax kale ma ay arki karin.
But it is difficult.	Laakiin way adag tahay.
First, there is who you are.	Marka hore, waxaa jira qofka aad tahay.
You are too small.	Aad baad u yar tahay.
He surprised me.	Wuu iga yaabay.
I don't know for sure.	Ma garanayo hubaal.
This was incorrect	Tani waxay ahayd mid aan sax ahayn
It was so much fun.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xiiso badan.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
That is so far.	Taasi waa ilaa hadda.
I will not be harmed.	Dhib igama dhici doonto.
That is exactly what it has become.	Taasi waa dhab waxa uu noqday.
This is going to be great.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
You know it's true.	Waad ogtahay inay run tahay.
I decided to lie.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan been sheego.
It was untrue.	Waxay ahayd wax aan run ahayn.
It's not pretty.	Ma qurux badna.
Me like everyone else.	Aniga sida qof walba.
No one else could see it.	Qof kale ma arki karin.
There were other things as well.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
Maybe it's the same as everything else here.	Malaha waa la mid sida wax kasta oo kale oo halkan ah.
Whatever you do.	Wax kasta oo aad sameyso.
I would take it that way, too.	Waxaan u qaadan lahaa sidaas, sidoo kale.
He felt helpless.	Waxa uu dareemay wax la’aan.
I hope you would.	Waxaan filayaa inaad yeeli lahayd.
There are so many of them.	Aad bay u badan yihiin taas.
It will always happen.	Had iyo jeer way dhici doontaa.
But also something else.	Laakiin sidoo kale wax kale.
More will come.	Wax badan ayaa iman doona.
Otherwise it can really go to one.	Haddii kale runtii waxay tagi kartaa mid.
There is no way to find out.	Ma jirto si loo ogaado.
I will discuss the latter.	Tan dambe ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
Great one.	Mid weyn.
It will take a job.	Waxay qaadan doontaa shaqo.
I didn't know how long it would take.	Ma garanayn inta ay qaadan doonto.
It felt familiar.	Waxa la dareemay in la yaqaan.
I like.	Waan jeclahay.
Obviously I did it again.	Sida cad ayaan mar kale sameeyay.
It didn't take long.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer.
She is much worse than him.	Aad bay uga xun tahay isaga.
Not the same, you know.	Isku mid maaha, waad ogtahay.
But it may not even be true.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa inaysan run ahayn.
No one is in the room.	Qofna ma joogo qolka.
It is always this.	Had iyo jeer waa tan.
That was a lot of money.	Taasi waxay ahayd lacag badan.
I like to talk.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan hadlo.
big enough.	weyn baa ku filan .
It was all very interesting.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
You can do this as many times as you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa tan inta jeer ee aad rabto.
I do not know what to do.	Waxaan sameeyo ma garanayo.
I don't think you are.	Uma maleynayo inaad tahay.
Nothing will be done.	Waxba lama qaban doono.
Seriously, he said.	Si dhab ah, ayuu yiri.
And he was popular.	Oo wuxuu ahaa mid la jecel yahay.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
Good idea, isn't it ?.	Fikrad wanaagsan, miyaanay ahayn?.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
You would find it interesting.	Waxaad ka heli lahayd mid xiiso leh.
You may have no idea how happy she is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan wax fikrad ah ka haysan inta ay ku faraxsan tahay.
She may think she is a friend.	Waxay u malayn kartaa inay tahay saaxiib.
Probably not much.	Waxay u badan tahay wax badan ma jiraan.
It's like he doesn't want me.	Waa sida uusan ii rabin.
I didn't do much.	Wax badan ma samayn.
I found things to tell you	Waxaan helay waxyaabo aan kuu sheego
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
Like when it was.	Sida markii ay ahayd.
Here is something surprising.	Halkan waxaa ah wax la yaab leh.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto taas.
You can't stay where you are.	Ma joogi kartid meel kasta oo aad joogto.
As you wish.	Sida aad rabto.
Most do not.	Inta badan ma sameeyaan.
And it will probably be for a long time.	Oo waxay u badan tahay inay ahaan doonaan muddo dheer.
Immediate and immediate cessation.	Joojin degdeg ah oo degdeg ah.
But now you can see.	Laakiin hadda waad arki kartaa.
No one has anything good.	Qofna wax fiican ma haysto.
This is not such a big deal.	Tani maaha wax sidaas u weyn.
I am here now.	Halkan ayaan hadda joogaa.
Please take this seriously.	Fadlan tan si dhab ah u qaado.
Not good.	Ma wanaagsan .
If you can get it.	Haddii aad ka heli karto.
It will not be !.	Ma ahaan doono!.
You can stay here, if you want.	Waxaad ku joogi kartaa halkan, haddii aad rabto.
It's amazing! 	Waa yaab!
It would help.	Way caawin lahayd.
I don't know what you really want to do.	Ma garanayo waxaad rabto inaad sameyso runtii.
She knew they existed.	Way ogaatay inay jiraan.
Lots to see.	Wax badan la arkay.
It's a little harder than that.	Way ka yara adag tahay taas.
It was bad, very bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun, aad u xun.
I know you love him very much.	Waan ogahay inaad aad u jeceshahay isaga.
No one stopped me.	Qofna ima joojin.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah maaha.
But he was right.	Laakiin run buu sheegay.
It is difficult for us.	Wuu nagu adag yahay.
It just couldn’t be better.	Kaliya ma ay noqon karin si wanaagsan.
There is still something else.	Weli wax kale ayaa jira.
I am ready to know now.	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan ogaado hadda.
This is why.	Tani waa sababta.
There was something terrible about him.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u xun isaga.
I think you will do the job.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaad qaban doonto shaqada.
But it needs something.	Laakiin waxay u baahan tahay wax.
Someone, something else was here.	Qof, wax kale ayaa halkan ahaa.
He is happy to be there.	Wuu ku faraxsan yahay inuu halkaas joogo.
Don't let me keep you.	Ha ii ogolaan in aan ku sii hayo.
Don't do anything too fast.	Waxba ha u samayn si degdeg ah.
It is enough for me.	Way igu filan tahay aniga.
That was busy.	Taasi waxay ahayd mashquul.
He is ready to be like that.	Wuxuu diyaar u yahay inuu sidaas noqdo.
You are really a good friend.	Runtii waxaad tahay saaxiib wanaagsan.
.	.
He was right.	Run buu sheegay.
You certainly did.	Hubaal inaad samaysay.
This may not end well.	Tani si wanaagsan kuma dhammaan karto.
He was at work.	Shaqada ayuu ku jiray.
Not sure what to do	Ma hubo waxa sameeyo
I just gave him a lie.	Kaliya waxaan siiyay been.
He also has no time.	Sidoo kale waqti ma leh.
As it should be.	Sida ay noqon lahayd.
It goes beyond this.	Way ka sii dheer tahay tan.
But I did nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale ma samayn.
Not much.	Ma badna.
They are very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
But no one wants it.	Laakiin qofna ma doonayo.
This cannot be a coincidence	Tani ma noqon karto wax iska dhacay
It may be bad.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay mid xun.
Something is wrong.	Wax aan sax ahayn.
He was a very lucky man.	Nin nasiib badan buu ahaa.
There was something wrong.	Wax baa ka jiray.
Tonight is you.	Caawa waa adiga.
That was beautiful.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
You will come when we.	Waxaad iman doontaa marka aanu.
Lots of things he still wanted to do.	Waxyaabo badan oo uu weli rabay inuu sameeyo.
I suspect he has a lot.	Waxaan tuhunsanahay inuu leeyahay badan.
You may not be able to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad hadda awoodi weyday.
But that is unnecessary.	Laakiin taasi waa mid aan loo baahnayn.
No one should have known about it.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu wax ka ogaado.
They will get nothing.	Waxba ma heli doonaan.
Don't spend too much money here.	Ha ku bixin lacag aad u badan halkan.
He knows he can't talk to her.	Wuu ogyahay inuusan la hadli karin.
He will not leave.	Ma bixi doono.
I wonder why.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta.
It was not too difficult.	Ma ahayn wax aad u adag.
This was not a coincidence	Tani ma ahayn wax iska dhacay
I explicitly denied that.	Taas si cad ayaan u diiday.
He entered.	Wuu galay.
Everyone knew.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa.
I have nothing left.	Ma haysto wax tagay.
Really, really hard.	Run ahaantii, aad u adag.
It was all very fast.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u degdeg badan.
Someone got it.	Qof baa helay.
If so, so.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, sidaas.
That will not be unprecedented.	Taasi ma noqon doonto mid aan hore loo arag.
I'm glad you are.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad tahay adiga.
Regular diet.	Cunto joogto ah.
She had everything I needed and more.	Waxay lahayd wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay iyo wax ka badan.
That was the main reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta ugu weyn.
I hope it is good.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay fiican tahay.
Strictly and accurately.	Si adag oo sax ah.
He should have told you earlier.	Waxay ahayd inuu mar hore kuu sheego.
I'm sure it's right.	Waan hubaa inay sax tahay.
Correct what you want.	Sax waxa aad rabto.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
Lots of things, really.	Waxyaabo badan, dhab ahaantii.
I will do it right	si sax ah ayaan u samayn doonaa
He was a bad little boy.	Nin yar oo xun buu ahaa.
I'm sure someone else thinks the same.	Waxaan hubaa in qof kale uu sidaas oo kale u malaynayo.
It would take time and money.	Waxay qaadan lahayd waqti iyo lacag.
Will do it soon.	Si degdeg ah u samayn doona.
I know a lot.	Wax badan ayaan ogahay.
But there is something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira.
Maybe that's how it was.	Malaha taasi waa sidii ay ahayd.
He was not a person and nothing.	Ma uu ahayn qof iyo waxba.
I will talk to you tomorrow.	berri ayaan kula hadli doonaa.
That would be correct.	Taasi sax bay ahaan lahayd.
No one is there.	Qofna kuma jiro.
And things came back.	Oo wax dib u soo noqday.
Just like me.	Si la mid ah aniga.
I'm glad it was once.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay ahayd hal mar.
But all you can do is tell them.	Laakiin waxa aad samayn karto oo dhan waa u sheeg.
There is only one.	Waxaa jira hal kaliya.
More than that really.	In ka badan ma aha runtii.
You do not need.	Uma baahnid.
It was very long too.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u dheer sidoo kale.
You have a real problem there.	Dhib dhab ah ayaad ku leedahay halkaas.
No one does this.	Qofna ma sameeyo kan.
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
Not too bad	Aad uma xun
I am not ready for that yet.	Taas weli diyaar uma ihi.
But if he did, it was too early.	Laakiin haddii uu sameeyay, waxay ahayd waqti hore.
It is everything.	Waa wax walba.
But it was beautiful.	Laakiin waxay ahayd qurux badan.
That is not what you need.	Taasi maaha waxa aad u baahan tahay.
But he seemed to know what they were.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqday inuu garanayo waxa ay yihiin.
I just want to be with you.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo.
Several people have told me this.	Dhowr qof ayaa ii sheegay tan.
It was wanted.	Waa la rabay.
I lied to you.	been baan kuu sheegay.
But I'm not sure how to do that.	Laakiin ma hubo sida loo sameeyo taas.
That's what I saw in him.	Taas ayaan ku arkay isaga.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
I'm not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta taasi tahay.
Everyone refused.	Qof kastaa wuu diiday.
He knows very well what they are.	Aad buu u garanayaa waxay yihiin.
He looked happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
He was here	Wuu joogay halkan
A little, really.	In yar, dhab ahaantii.
I was well impressed.	Si fiican ayaan ula dhacay.
Even if you are just interested.	Xitaa haddii aad kaliya xiiso u leedahay.
Nothing is over.	Waxba ma dhammaan.
That's what everyone said.	Sidaas ayuu qof walba yiri.
He said it was enough.	Wuxuu yidhi waa ku filan tahay.
But they did not know what he was like.	Laakiin ma ay garanayn waxa uu hadda yahay.
Nothing was left out.	Ma jirin wax meesha ka baxay.
Not very sure.	Aad uma hubo.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
That they are friends.	In ay saaxiibo yihiin.
Let me tell you something.	Aan wax kuu sheego.
Now he knew.	Hadda wuu ogaa.
It will still get better.	Weli way fiicnaan doontaa.
He wanted to learn.	Wuxuu rabay inuu barto.
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay.
It really is unbelievable.	Runtii waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
It's the same for me.	Waa isku mid aniga.
That was nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub ma ahayn.
I will stay there	halkaas ayaan joogi doonaa
I just want to do everything.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax walba.
You can't get it without it.	Wax la'aan kuma heli kartid.
I couldn't do any harm	Ma yeeli karin wax dhibaato ah
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
No one has a problem here	Qofna dhib kuma hayo halkan
He became the greatest.	Waxa uu noqday kan ugu weyn.
People did not understand.	Dadka ma ay fahmin.
He couldn't talk about it.	Waa uu ka hadli waayay.
He has not been at home since yesterday.	Ma uusan joogin guriga tan iyo shalay.
An empty space.	Meel aan waxba ka jirin.
But this was the best way.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd sida ugu wanaagsan.
And it should be well.	Oo si fiican waa in.
This is, really, really what she did.	Tani waa, runtii, dhab ahaan waxay samaysay.
It can't happen, as it was done correctly.	Ma dhici karto, sida si sax ah loo sameeyay.
This is enough for me.	Waa kan aniga igu filan.
It was some time ago.	Waxay ahayd waqti ka hor.
I just couldn't believe it.	Kaliya waan rumaysan waayay.
I can do something for you	wax baan kuu qaban karaa
Not available.	Lama heli karo.
It was a very long time.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u dheer.
He is indeed a good man.	Runtii waa nin wanaagsan.
What if.	Maxaa dhici lahaa haddii .
They did not give me a chance.	Ima ay siin fursad.
so I was.	sidaas ayaan ahaa.
You bring it.	Adiga ayaa soo wada.
I still can't believe it.	Wali ma rumaysan karo.
This is what I will do.	Tani waa waxa aan sameyn doono.
For me, it’s not too much.	Aniga, aad uma badna.
I will not return.	Wali soo noqon maayo.
Still no problem.	Wali dhib ma lahayn.
It was still a day.	Weli maalin bay ahayd.
That was what he would say.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu odhan lahaa.
Not surprisingly.	Ma aha wax la yaab leh.
It should be enough for you.	Waa inay kugu filan tahay.
It is common.	Waa wax la wada leeyahay.
He really looks happy.	Runtii wuxuu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan.
I found it here.	Halkan ayaan ka helay.
Can someone please help me with this.	Qof fadlan ma iga caawin karaa tan.
She was like someone else.	Waxay ahayd sida qof kale.
I know it was.	Waan ogahay waxay ahayd.
I just know they are.	Kaliya waan ogahay inay yihiin.
I made a lot of money for you.	Lacag badan baan kuu sameeyay.
I am at work	Waxaan joogaa shaqada
I know he can do better.	Waan ogahay inuu wax ka fiican samayn karo.
Take time to do this.	Waqti ku qaado inaad tan sameyso.
I'm leaving now.	hadda waan tagi.
It came out of him.	Waxaa soo baxay isaga.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
Maybe someone happened.	Malaha qof baa dhacay.
But it doesn't matter to me.	Laakiin aniga waxba igama aha.
It can also be very difficult.	Waxa kale oo ay noqon kartaa mid aad u adag.
Everyone knows.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay.
No one wants to work there.	Qofna ma rabo inuu halkaas ka shaqeeyo.
All very happy.	Dhammaan aad u faraxsan.
I need to know what happened.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado waxa dhacay.
It may not be the right thing to do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
Someone once was there.	Waa hore qof baa jiray.
Maybe I have	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hayo
Please do not say.	Fadlan ha odhan.
It includes other very difficult things.	Waxaa ka mid ah waxyaabo kale oo aad u adag.
I have never been, really.	Weligay ma aanan ahayn, run ahaantii.
Now, everything is fine.	Hadda, wax walba waa iska fiican yihiin.
This is not a new idea.	Tani maaha fikrad cusub.
One of us.	Mid naga mid ah.
It is very common.	Aad ayuu ugu badan yahay.
Very fast.	Aad u degdeg badan.
This is what he wants from us now.	Tani waa waxa uu hadda naga rabo.
But she did not want to do that.	Laakiin ma ay rabin in ay taas samayso.
Everything was available.	Wax walba waa la heli jiray.
There is no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
Please don't believe me.	Fadlan ha i rumaysan.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
Nothing interesting.	Ma jiro wax xiiso leh.
Always be aware.	Had iyo jeer in la ogaado.
You look like one.	Waxaad u egtahay mid.
Anything and everything.	Wax kasta iyo wax kasta.
It is unemployment.	Waa shaqo la’aan.
In fact, you can do it right there.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaad ku samayn kartaa isla halkaas.
Everyone he talks to.	Qof kasta oo uu la hadlo.
Maybe it's nothing.	Laga yaabaa in aanay waxba ahayn.
Now, more than ever this is true.	Hadda, in ka badan sidii hore tani waa run.
It was the right thing to do.	Waxay ahayd wax sax ah.
Certainly it was.	Hubaal waxay ahayd.
He had no friends.	Saaxiibo ma lahayn.
Not really sure how to do this.	Runtii ma hubo sida tan loo sameeyo.
Something prevented him from saying much.	Wax baa u diiday inuu wax badan sheego.
Amazing job as always !.	Shaqo yaab leh sida had iyo jeer!.
It was weird, but it wasn't.	Waxay ahayd yaab, laakiin ma ahayn.
It's too much.	Way aad u badan tahay.
I would also like to do.	Waxaan sidoo kale jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo.
I can get out of this at any time.	Waan ka bixi karaa tan wakhti kasta.
She really likes it.	Runtii way jeceshahay.
That's how he did it.	Waa sidii uu sameeyay.
Surprisingly, friend.	Taas ka yaab badan, saaxiib.
Someone who doesn't need it now.	Qof aan hadda u baahnayn.
Nice place and person.	Meel fiican iyo qof.
He would do that alone.	Keligiis ayuu taas samayn lahaa.
She was smart.	Waxay ahayd caqli badan.
There is nothing exciting there.	Ma jiraan wax xiiso badan halkaas.
I did nothing.	waxba maan qaban.
It’s so much more.	Waa wax aad u badan.
And they will still be.	Oo weli way ahaan doonaan.
He seems to be happy.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa in uu ku faraxsan yahay.
And he looks very happy.	Oo wuxuu u muuqdaa mid aad ugu faraxsan.
I don’t feel him here and even near.	Ma dareemayo isaga halkan iyo xitaa meel u dhow.
It was something to be felt.	Waxay ahayd wax la dareemay.
He does everything and does it well.	Wax walba wuu sameeyaa oo si fiican ayuu u sameeyaa.
Not all.	Dhammaan maaha.
Both are more likely.	Labaduba waxay u badan tahay.
I need to leave	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan baxo
I think it's a good idea.	Waxaan filayaa inay fikrad fiican tahay.
But I'm happy.	Laakiin waan ku faraxsanahay.
He came from here.	Halkan ayuu ka yimid.
I am very happy to have found it.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan helay.
Maybe we will go tonight.	Malaha waanu tagi doonaa caawa.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
That has always been the hardest thing for him.	Taas ayaa had iyo jeer ahayd waxa ugu adag isaga.
They would not do that.	Ma ay yeeli lahayn taas.
You need one.	Waxaad u baahan tahay mid.
It was not, but he did not know it.	Ma ahayn, laakiin taas ma uu ogayn.
He came back too late.	Aad buu u soo noqday goor dambe.
It was always me, me, me.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd aniga, aniga, aniga.
Shortly afterwards a small group of people came out of the house.	Wax yar ka dib waxa guriga ku soo baxay qof ku yar.
I know how difficult that is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u adag tahay.
I love you.	waan ku jeclahay adiga.
It wasn’t surprising, really.	Ma ahayn wax la yaab leh, runtii.
Something to give.	Wax la siin lahaa.
Really good job.	Runtii shaqo aad u wanaagsan.
But few tried.	Laakiin in yar ayaa isku dayay.
Probably nothing.	Waxay u badan tahay in aanay waxba ahayn.
I was just with him.	Kaliya waan la joogay.
I already had.	Hore ayaan u lahaa.
It made good money, too.	Waxa la sameeyay lacag fiican, sidoo kale.
No wonder.	La yaab maayo.
Very happy there, too.	Aad ugu faraxsan halkaas, sidoo kale.
A man came.	Nin baa yimid.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
I can't speak.	Ma hadli karo.
And he was bad.	Oo wuxuu ahaa mid xun.
He could not see.	Wuu arki waayay.
No one did much.	Qofna wax badan ma samayn.
This is always difficult.	Tani mar walba way adag tahay.
He didn't have to do anything.	Ma ahayn inuu wax sameeyo.
Enough.	Ku filan lahaa.
They do everything and everything.	Waxay sameeyaan wax kasta iyo wax kasta.
You can't imagine.	Ma malayn kartid.
He knew something was going to happen.	Wuu ogaa in wax ku dhici doonaan.
I'm sure he did.	Waan hubaa inuu sameeyay.
Like more than one.	Sida wax ka badan hal.
Tell me where you are.	Meesha aad joogto ii sheeg.
He is there most of the time.	Inta badan wuu joogaa.
I think that's right.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay taasi sax tahay.
This should be good.	Tani waa inay wanaagsan tahay.
I haven't seen him in a while.	In muddo ah maan arag.
They are all beautiful and the same.	Dhammaan waa qurux iyo isku mid.
That would be awful.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
Until recently, he was a good man.	Ilaa dhawaan, wuxuu ahaa nin fiican.
Just do what he asked of me.	Kaliya inaan sameeyo waxa uu iga codsaday.
They no longer knew me.	Mar dambe ima ay garanayn.
Three came out.	Saddex ayaa soo baxay.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
I refused	waan diiday
Please give it to me.	Fadlan i sii.
Live with him every day.	Maalin walba isaga la nool.
Both are not the same.	Labaduba isku mid maaha.
You know it is too.	Waad ogtahay inay sidoo kale tahay.
They didn't have time.	Waqti uma ay helin.
Ready for anything, anytime.	U diyaar ah wax kasta, wakhti kasta.
Nothing more.	Wax mar dambe ma jiraan.
But it was amazing.	Laakiin waxay ahayd yaab.
I am not so great.	Ma ihi sidaas u weyn.
I could not do anything.	Waxba maan awoodin.
I'll just leave	Kaliya waan bixi doonaa
.	.
No one wants to eat you.	Qofna ma rabo inuu ku cuno.
It can't hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli karto.
Obviously you are not a man.	Waxaa cad in aadan ahayn nin.
I didn't think it was weird.	Ma u malayn inay yaab leh.
And even better, faster.	Iyo xitaa ka sii fiican, degdeg ah.
Not much.	Wax badan ma jiraan.
I just felt it.	Kaliya waan dareemay.
I still don't understand.	Wali ma fahmin.
Ah, that's it.	Ahaa, taasi waa.
You do not need to do this.	Uma baahnid inaad taas samayso.
But there is nothing you want.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax aad rabto.
I don’t like uncertainty	Ma jecli hubaal la'aan
He seemed smart.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid caqli badan.
Enough, he seemed to feel, now.	Oo ku filan, wuxuu u muuqday inuu dareemayo, hadda.
I now.	anigu hadda .
There is no way they can not.	Ma jirto si aysan u awoodin.
I have to stay with you	waa inaan kula joogo
He really knew.	Runtii wuu ogaa.
You can't leave.	Ma ka bixi kartid.
It certainly is.	Waa hubaal inay tahay.
Maybe he even likes it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xitaa jecel yahay.
This will take a long time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti dheer.
He may be present.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu la joogo.
It may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan ahayn.
He said he could not do that.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu taas samayn karin.
This was a long time ago.	Tani waxay ahayd waqti hore.
Maybe that is true now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi run tahay hadda.
I found.	Waan helay.
I really don’t.	Runtii ma sameeyo.
He was not like him.	Ma ahayn isaga oo kale.
I doubt she can.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay awoodi karto.
He did not come alone.	Keligiis ma iman.
What will happen, will happen.	Maxaa dhici doona, ayaa dhici doona.
She said clearly.	Waxay si cad u sheegtay.
Let it come to you.	Ha kuu yimaado.
Good for everyone.	Qof walba u fiican.
I will come very soon.	Waxaan iman doonaa waqti aad u dhow.
I would like to, but it would be a lie.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa, laakiin waxay noqon lahayd been.
There was no telling exactly.	Ma jirin si dhab ah oo loo sheego.
But there was so much more that I did not do.	Laakiin waxaa jiray wax badan oo kale oo aan samayn.
But there is still a lot more to do.	Laakiin waxaa weli jira wax badan oo kale oo la sameeyo.
If they.	Haddii ay .
What he really says is this.	Runtii waxa uu leeyahay waa kan.
Everyone has a good time.	Qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay waqti fiican.
He said it would do me no good.	Waxa uu yidhi waxba igama samaynayso.
You know they can't.	Waad ogtahay inaysan awoodin.
I still do it now.	Weli waan sameeyaa hadda.
I know every little person.	Qof kasta oo yar ayaan garanayaa.
I had to help you.	Waxay ahayd inaan ku caawiyo.
I found it here	halkaan ayaan ku helay
You do not need it again	Uma baahnid mar kale
She was smart.	Waxay ahayd caqli badan.
Tell us what happened.	Noo sheeg waxa dhacay.
I hope someone can give me an idea.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof i siin karo fikrad.
If not, it is not.	Haddii uusan ahayn, ma aha.
Really hard.	Runtii aad u adag.
He looked good.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan .
I am a good friend of people.	Waxaan ahay saaxiib wanaagsan dadka.
They are much bigger than that.	Aad bay uga weyn yihiin taas.
Most of the time he did this.	Inta badan tan wuu samayn jiray.
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
He felt you were at home.	Waxa uu dareemay in aad guriga ku jirto.
I didn't think she would.	Uma malaynayn inay yeeli doonto.
It would all be done.	Dhammaan waa la samayn lahaa.
I just won’t do it.	Kaliya ma sameyn doono.
He is not a bad person.	Ma aha qof xun.
Anything too much.	Wax kasta oo aad u badan.
That is just you.	Taasi waa adiga kaliya.
There is always someone who knows.	Mar walba waxaa jira qof wax yaqaan.
I have no urgency.	Wax degdeg ah kuma hayo.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I think that will happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi dhici doonto.
I need to be there	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas joogo
No one was present.	Qofna meesha ma joogin.
I will do everything for you, everything for you.	Wax walba waan kuu sameyn doonaa, wax walba adiga.
Just the whole room.	Kaliya qolka oo dhan.
This is more than that.	Tani waa wax ka badan.
he refused.	wuu diiday.
This is probably true.	Tani malaha waa run.
You could not give me enough money to stay.	Ma aad siin karin lacag kugu filan oo aan ku joogo.
But it is not true.	Laakiin run maaha.
I would go	waan tagi lahaa
Just give it time.	Kaliya sii waqti.
There is not much.	Ma jiraan wax badan.
I will do well.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa si fiican.
So far, I can't do anything.	Ilaa hadda, waxba ma awoodo.
I can't be smart.	Ma noqon karo caqli badan.
And if not, that's fine too.	Oo haddii aysan ahayn, taasi sidoo kale waa fiican tahay.
It's not smart.	Ma ahan wax caqli badan.
Someone had to tell me.	Waxay ahayd in qof ii sheego.
Please just stop.	Fadlan jooji kaliya.
It is better to go home.	Waxaa fiican inaad guriga aado.
I didn't think so.	Taas waxba uma malaynayn.
I can see you better.	Waan ku arki karaa si fiican.
Everything still exists.	Wax walba xitaa way sii jiraan.
She is still fine.	Wali way fiican tahay.
he can stay.	wuu joogi karaa.
Something beautiful and beautiful.	Wax qurux badan oo qurux badan.
Tell the truth now.	Run hadda sheeg.
He is so close, he wonders what he is doing.	Aad ayuu u dhow yahay, waa uu la yaabay waxa uu sameeyo.
I know it all looks amazing.	Waan ogahay in ay dhammaan u egtahay wax yaab leh.
It looks like.	Waxay u egtahay.
We can't have anything.	Waxba ma haysan karno.
I saw a lot.	Wax badan ayaan arkay.
Not right	Sax maaha
He would love it more than himself.	Keligiis ayuu ka jeclaan lahaa.
I really am not the right person.	Runtii ma ihi qof sax ah.
She would do what she could.	Waxay samayn lahayd wixii la samayn lahaa.
But that was not true.	Laakiin taasi run ma ahayn.
This was a problem for him.	Tani waxay dhib ku ahayd isaga.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
She did not return.	Dib uma ay soo noqon.
This will not do that.	Tani ma qaban doonto taas.
It will not be too early.	Ma uu noqon doonin goor hore.
That could be the same.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa sidoo kale.
No one can tell you the location.	Qofna kuma sheegi karo meesha.
This is a very bad idea.	Tani waa fikrad aad u xun.
But it will be very bad.	Laakiin waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u xun.
It will come out.	Way soo bixi doontaa.
Now everyone does.	Hadda qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
Not yesterday, longer.	Shalay maaha, ka dheer.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
It should not be anything other than that.	Waa in aanay noqon wax aan taas ahayn.
He is still there tomorrow	Berri wali ma joogo
I am not here and there.	Anigu ma joogo halkan iyo halkaas.
He made her want him.	Wuxuu ka dhigay inay isaga rabto.
Maybe we still have a chance.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli fursad noo jirto.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
If only you would give me a chance.	Haddii kaliya aad fursad i siin doonto.
It really should.	Runtii waa inay.
I didn’t have a lot of good food either.	Ma aanan haysan cunto badan oo wanaagsan sidoo kale.
And now here it is.	Oo hadda waa kan.
This will not be a problem.	Tani dhib ma ahaan doonto.
It still exists.	Weli waxaa jira.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
Take a good one.	Qaado mid wanaagsan.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan.
Either way it was.	Si kasta oo ay ahayd.
But she told him he was alive.	Laakiin waxay u sheegtay inuu nool yahay.
Like me, once.	Aniga oo kale, hal mar.
Only this cannot be true.	Kaliya tani run ma noqon karto.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
Nothing came of it.	Waxba uma iman.
I can tell he wants to leave here.	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inuu doonayo inuu halkan ka baxo.
I know he is.	Waan ogahay inuu yahay.
It's bad for you.	Wuu kuu xun yahay.
They may not be the same man.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan isku nin ahayn.
He had a job there.	Halkaas ayuu shaqo ku lahaa.
I think that was great.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi ay ahayd mid weyn.
Good job man.	Nin shaqo fiican.
We will see this clearly now.	Tani waxaan si cad u arki doonaa hadda.
He would be right.	Sax buu ahaan lahaa.
I told you.	waan kuu sheegay.
But no one will say so clearly.	Laakiin qofna si cad uma odhan doono.
But they did not.	Laakiin ma ay lahayn.
It is always there.	Had iyo jeer waa halkaas.
.	.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale maaha.
You can certainly do more.	Waxaa hubaal ah inaad wax badan qaban karto.
We can't help it.	Ma caawin karno.
I don't mind.	Waxba kama qabo.
I am very happy for him.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga.
It is not necessary.	Ma aha in loo baahan yahay.
I'll tell you another time.	Waqti kale ayaan u sheegi doonaa.
I got nothing	Waxba ma helin
Now he had one.	Hadda mid buu lahaa.
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
He will do it until he does it well.	Wuu samayn doonaa ilaa uu si fiican u sameeyo.
I would love to see you here.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku arko halkan.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
It is predictable.	Waa wax la malayn karo.
I'm afraid it's not permanent.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaysan ahayn mid joogto ah.
Just tell me what you want.	Kaliya ii sheeg waxaad rabto.
Not true but not really.	Run maaha laakiin runtii dhib ma leh.
All very beautiful.	Dhammaan aad u qurux badan.
Not sure if it is still available	Ma hubo in wali la heli karo
Everything is beautiful.	Wax walba oo qurux badan.
There is nothing we can do to stop it.	Ma jirto wax aan ku joojin karno.
And it's a great time.	Oo waa waqti aad u fiican.
That can be very good.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
It was more than just that.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan oo kaliya.
It is so beautiful.	Waa mid aad u qurux badan.
he would stay.	wuu joogi lahaa.
It just isn’t that hard.	Kaliya maaha mid adag.
You.	Adiga ku .
Maybe he is alive.	Malaha wuu nool yahay.
He told people.	Dadka ayuu u sheegay.
Maybe you weren’t.	Malaha ma aadan ahayn.
Nothing else happened.	Wax kale oo dhacay ma jirin.
That would really be great.	Taasi runtii aad bay u fiicnaan lahayd.
He really did not know why.	Si dhab ah ma uu garanayn sababta.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
It was wanted, but it was not possible.	Waa la rabay, laakiin ma awoodin.
But she did not say anything.	Laakiin waxba uma ay sheegin.
Everyone from here knows that.	Qof kasta oo halkan ka yimid wuu garanayaa taas.
I was in a bad mood.	Waxaan ku jiray si xun.
He disappeared.	Wuu waayay.
Obviously something needs to be done.	Wax cad in loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
He could not believe it very much.	Aad ayuu u rumaysan waayay.
As you can see here.	Sida aad arki karto halkan.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
Everything else is the same.	Wax kasta oo kale waa isku mid.
I started again	dib baan u bilaabay
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
That's right for me.	Waa iga sax.
I really have no idea.	Runtii wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
This was amazing.	Tani waxay ahayd yaab.
You just have to.	Kaliya waa inaad.
I hope someone can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof ku caawin karo.
It is a lie.	Waa been.
It’s the only thing he wants to do.	Waa waxa kaliya ee uu rabo inuu sameeyo.
She says nothing.	Waxba ma sheegto.
I wanted to go home.	Waxaan rabay inaan guriga aado.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
They are with us, really.	Waxay nala jiraan, runtii.
You need a job for that.	Waxaad u baahan tahay shaqo taas.
Tom gave it to me.	Tom wuu i siiyay.
Very little.	Aad u yar.
We would just talk about it and do it.	Kaliya waan ka hadli lahayn oo sameyn lahayn.
I'm really sure.	Runtii waan hubaa.
This was what she did.	Tani waxay ahayd waxa ay samaysay.
It should be picked up a little.	Waa in wax yar la soo qaado.
I came in	waan soo galay
This was the best way.	Tani waxay ahayd sida ugu wanaagsan.
I really need to be surprised.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan la yaabanahay.
That was a little difficult.	Taasi waxay ahayd dhib yar.
Who really knows, but him.	Yaa runtii yaqaan, laakiin isaga.
A little strange.	Wax yar oo yaab leh.
he could not hold me.	wuu i qaban waayay.
It's him.	Waa isaga.
He said nothing.	Waxba ma odhan.
It was not a good thing.	Wax wanaagsan ma ahayn.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in uusan rabin.
But he had plenty of food.	Laakiin wuxuu lahaa cunto badan.
There is something you want but cannot.	Waxaa jira wax aad rabto laakiin aadan awoodin.
I am very sure of this.	Aad ayaan u hubaa tan.
And fresh every day.	Oo cusub maalin kasta.
Got it.	U helay .
As if they were real.	Sida haddii ay dhab yihiin.
Not everyone is smart.	Qof kastaa maaha mid caqli badan.
You did well.	Si fiican ayaad u samaysay.
It will not come out.	Soo bixi maayo.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
That is not the case, he said.	Sidaas maaha ayuu yidhi.
Everyone else is fine.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa ku fiican.
This cannot happen again.	Tani mar kale ma dhici karto.
You rejected me.	Waad i diiday.
I was three.	Saddex baan ahaa.
But I did not understand that.	Laakiin taas ma fahmin.
They did not see it.	Ma ay arag.
But he would catch me.	Laakiin wuu i qaban lahaa.
Surprisingly it persists.	Waxa la yaab leh in ay sii jirto.
It is felt.	Waa lagu dareemay.
I am not alone.	Kaliya ma ihi.
I have never seen anything like it.	Wax la mid ah ma arag.
It is likely to happen.	Waxay u badan tahay inay dhici lahayd.
No matter what and how you like it.	Dhib malaha waxa iyo sida aad jeceshahay.
Lots of trouble.	Dhibaato badan.
No one can, as very difficult.	Qofna ma awoodo, sida aad u dhib badan.
I wish there was something else.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inay jiraan wax kale.
She did something.	Wax bay samaysay.
Not often.	Inta badan maaha.
You look like a very tough guy.	Waxaad u egtahay nin aad u adag.
It was a very difficult job.	Waxay ahayd shaqo aad u adag.
It may be here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay halkan joogto.
I found some great stuff.	Waxaan helay waxyaabo aad u fiican.
A lot is clear here.	Wax badan ayaa halkan ku cad.
It really is.	Dhab ahaantii waa.
Well, it looks good.	Fiican, waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
But I had no problem.	Laakiin wax dhib ah uma helin.
That was done.	Taasi waa la sameeyay.
The only thing you have to do is you.	Waxa kaliya ee ay tahay inaad sameyso waa adiga.
I'm back now.	Hadda ayaan ku noqday.
That is a promise !.	Taasi waa ballan!.
Can't help now.	Hadda lama caawin karo.
He did it again.	Mar kale ayuu sameeyay.
One being held by another.	Mid lagu haysto mid kale.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
She can't do anything else.	Wax kale ma samayn karto.
He wants more.	Wax badan buu rabaa.
It cannot be spontaneous.	Ma noqon karto wax iska yimid.
There was nothing we could do to help him.	Ma jirin wax aan ku caawin karno isaga.
All the while.	Inta oo dhan.
No one is there.	Qofna kuma jiro.
But a lot happened quickly.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa si degdeg ah u dhacay.
He felt more than ever.	Waxa uu dareemay in ka badan sidii hore.
it will return	way soo noqon doontaa
He tried to help.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu caawiyo.
If you did, you know.	Haddii aad samaysay, waad ogtahay.
I say! 	Waxaan leeyahay!
He does a lot of things like that.	Wuxuu sameeyaa wax badan oo sidaas oo kale ah.
I had to go home.	Waxay ahayd inaan guriga aado.
As close as you like.	Sida ugu dhow ee aad jeceshahay.
That is not what we do.	Taasi maaha waxa aan samayno.
He could not be there.	Halkaas ayuu joogi waayay.
I thought you would find it interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad ka heli doonto mid xiiso leh.
There could be nothing else.	Ma jirin wax kale oo ay noqon kartaa.
He loves to work.	Wuxuu jecel yahay inuu shaqeeyo.
You really can't tell.	Runtii ma sheegi kartid.
But you will get it.	Laakiin waad heli doontaa.
That is exactly what is not needed.	Taasi waa si sax ah waxa aan loo baahnayn.
Lots of fun.	Wax badan oo xiiso badan.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
I will do more than that.	Waxaan sameyn doonaa wax ka badan taas.
I would have left here soon	Dhawaan ayaan halkan ka bixi lahaa
Everything is still the same.	Wax walba weli waa isku mid.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani sax maaha.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
I never really knew.	Weligay runtii ma garanayn.
I'm sorry.	waan kaa xumahay.
If you can't see it, please let me know.	Haddii aadan arki karin, fadlan ii soo sheeg.
Not done.	Lama samayn.
Not small	Ma yara
That was rejected.	Taasi waa la diiday.
Just great	Kaliya ku weyn
It can be done for a long time as well.	Waxa la samayn karaa muddo dheer sidoo kale.
I think it is not correct.	Waxaan filayaa inaysan sax ahayn.
Everything will be fine now.	Wax walba hadda way fiicnaan doonaan.
Now that.	Hadda oo ah.
All but one.	Dhammaan mid aan ahayn.
It was not hard work.	Ma ahayn shaqo adag.
I don't want to know anything about it.	Ma rabo inaan wax ka ogaado.
Too much, really.	Aad u badan, dhab ahaantii.
Before anyone arrives.	Inta aanu qof iman.
And maybe you.	Oo malaha adiga.
He wanted to leave me there.	Waxa uu rabay in uu iga tago aniga oo jira.
It is very good now.	Hadda aad bay u fiican tahay.
No one can help me.	Qofna ma i caawin karaa.
I don't know what to do now.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo hadda.
I don't see why he should do it.	Ma arko sababta uu u samayn lahaa.
Tomorrow may be a good day for that.	Berrito waxaa laga yaabaa inay maalin wanaagsan u tahay taas.
Let me keep it.	Aan sii hayo.
This was an opportunity.	Tani waxay ahayd fursad.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
She is good there.	Way ku fiican tahay halkaas.
This will be something else.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa wax kale.
Which is not surprising after all, since.	Taas oo aan ahayn wax la yaab leh ka dib dhan, tan iyo .
But we need everyone to work on this.	Laakiin waxaan u baahanahay qof walba inuu ka shaqeeyo arrintan.
They will find him.	Way heli doonaan isaga.
I always wondered why.	Waxaan had iyo jeer la yaabay sababta.
No talk to him.	Lama hadlin isaga.
You don't have to do that for me.	Uma baahnid inaan taas kuu sameeyo.
It's not over yet.	Weli ma dhammaan.
Very bad.	Aad u xun.
I left everything to chance.	Wax walba fursad ayaan uga tagay.
Still the same problem.	Weli dhibaato isku mid ah.
Interesting to know.	Xiiso leh in la ogaado.
I can lie	been waan sheegi karaa
Take it seriously.	Si dhab ah u qaado.
It had nothing to do with you.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn adiga.
Much later.	Sida badan ka dib.
we will see.	waan arki doonaa.
She did it for me.	Way igu samaysay.
But he could not stop.	Laakiin wuu joojin waayay.
But true for us.	Laakiin run noo.
I am for them all.	Waxaan u wada ahay.
It has been revoked.	Waa laga noqday.
There is nothing so beautiful and beautiful to look at.	Ma jiro wax aad u qurux badan oo qurux badan oo dib u eegay.
It is not an exciting day like when you were younger.	Ma aha maalin xiiso leh sida marka aad ka yar tahay.
I should have seen it.	Waxay ahayd inaan arko.
Either way.	Si kasta oo ay tahay.
Anyone can do this.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa tan.
I didn't want anything else.	Wax kale ma rabin.
In fact, he could not get out.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu ka bixi waayay.
I got interested.	Waxaan helay xiiso.
But it had to be talked about.	Laakiin waxay ahayd in laga hadlo.
I have to go home now.	Waa inaan hadda aado guriga.
In fact, they are very small.	Dhab ahaantii, aad bay u yar yihiin.
It's true .	Waa run .
They are mostly good.	Inta badan way wanaagsan yihiin.
They are bad.	Way xun yihiin.
It will not stop for a long time.	Muddo dheer ma joojin doono.
I think work is more than just fun.	Waxay ila tahay shaqo ka badan wax xiiso leh.
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
You will be fine with this.	Waad ku fiicnaan doontaa tan.
I'll see you right	sax ayaan ku arki doonaa
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
All is well if you can get it.	Dhammaan way wanaagsan tahay haddii aad heli karto.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan.
The best thing to do if you want.	Waxa ugu fiican ee la sameeyo haddii aad rabto.
I will go again.	Mar kale ayaan tagi doonaa.
He wanted me.	Wuu iga rabay.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
I didn't get a chance.	Fursad ma helin.
Now he had a very good idea.	Hadda wuxuu lahaa fikrad aad u wanaagsan.
I can't say enough good enough for him.	Wax ku filan oo fiican isaga kama sheegi karo.
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
Everyone had something strange to say about him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu lahaa wax yaab leh inuu isaga ka sheego.
I owe you a great deal.	mid weyn baan kugu leeyahay.
It's a great place.	Waa meel aad u fiican.
He was there to help.	Wuxuu u joogay inuu caawiyo.
I don't like that very much.	Aad uma jecli taas.
I was very lucky for that.	Nasiib badan ayaan u lahaa taas.
To be seen again.	In dib loo arko.
Whatever you may be, that is what you will always be.	Wax kasta oo aad ahaan lahayd, taasi waa waxa aad had iyo jeer ahaan lahayd.
Let it come to you.	Ha kuu yimaado.
After all, it’s not much.	Taas ka dib, ma aha wax aad u badan.
It sounds like this, but it's not.	Waxay la mid tahay tan, laakiin sidaas maaha.
One man,.	Hal nin,.
When someone loves you he really loves them.	Marka uu qof jecel yahay si dhab ah ayuu u jecel yahay.
But that is nothing new.	Laakiin taasi wax cusub maaha.
It could not have been him.	Ma dhici karto inuu isaga ahaa.
But now we cannot stop.	Laakiin hadda ma joojin karno.
Not yet.	Wali ma jirin.
A very beautiful person.	Qof aad u qurux badan.
I have something else that is equally interesting.	Waxaan hayaa wax kale oo si la mid ah u xiiso badan.
I really like it so far.	Runtii waan jeclahay ilaa hadda.
I really don't think they will happen.	Runtii uma maleynayo inay dhici doonaan.
Everyone knew who she was.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa cidda ay tahay.
Anything you can get from him.	Wax kasta oo aad ka heli kartaa isaga.
I did not succeed	Maan guulaysan
And work.	Iyo shaqo.
So great is it.	Sidaas oo kale aad bay u weyn tahay.
I just got it.	Waxa aan helay oo kaliya.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
Maybe they should.	Malaha waa inay.
You can only do that for a while.	Waxa kaliya oo aad samayn kartaa in muddo ah.
I had nothing.	waxba maan haysan.
Now I'm back.	Hadda waan soo noqday.
Maybe he will.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sameeyo.
You will definitely get it.	Waa hubaal inaad heli doonto.
It will be.	Wuu ahaan doonaa.
Sure you have it now.	Hubaal in aad hadda leedahay.
That was true.	Taasi run bay ahayd.
I have said this sometimes.	Mar mar ayaan tan sheegay.
Lots of fun.	Wax badan oo xiiso leh.
He is a tough guy.	Waa nin adag.
Don't go back.	Dib ha u noqon.
Obviously, that was not true.	Sida cad, taasi run ma ahayn.
Now this is amazing.	Hadda tani waa mid la yaab leh.
But surprisingly.	Laakiin wax yaab leh.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u fiican.
We will get it right	Waanu heli doonaa sax
They weren’t here, after all.	Ma ay joogin halkan, ka dib oo dhan.
I never did, for sure.	Weligay maan samayn, hubaal.
The latter was true.	Tan dambe run bay ahayd.
I thought so.	sidaas ayaan mooday .
It would help me a lot.	Wax badan bay i caawin lahayd.
It can't be.	Ma noqon karto.
All well.	Dhammaan si wanaagsan.
All of this is very interesting.	Dhammaan tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
he would return.	wuu soo noqon lahaa.
He was just a little bad.	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya wax yar oo xun.
It is the best.	Waa tan ugu fiican.
I guess you don't know.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaadan garanayn.
I have to know.	Waa inaan ogaado.
I have to now.	Waa inaan hadda.
I had to work.	Waxay ahayd inaan shaqeeyo.
More to do, more to do.	Wax badan oo la sameeyo, wax badan oo la sameeyo.
No one is there.	Qofna meesha ma joogo.
are not included	kuma jiraan
He always had.	Mar walba wuu lahaa.
They may not go.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay tagin.
Everything is correct.	Wax walba waa sax.
I really have to have a man.	Runtii waa inaan leeyahay nin.
It may not be so now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas ahayn hadda.
But it is not permanent.	Laakiin ma aha joogto.
Everything that happened is before me.	Dhammaan wixii dhacay waa iga hor.
It is not empty.	Ma aha mid aan waxba haysan.
That is great for everyone else.	Taasi aad bay ugu fiican tahay qof kasta oo kale.
Every man who does that has a problem.	Nin kasta oo taas samayn lahaa dhibaato buu leeyahay.
That is very good.	Taasi aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I thought this would be great.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay fiicnaan lahayd.
I suspect.	Ma tuhunsanahay.
You always need that.	Mar walba taas ayaad u baahan tahay.
I really don't know what else to say.	Runtii ma garanayo wax kale oo aan sheego.
He was surprised.	Waa la yaabay.
It's very popular, you know.	Waa mid aad loo jecel yahay, waad ogtahay.
He seemed real.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid dhab ah.
There was a lot in it.	Wax badan ayaa ku jiray.
There was nothing bad we could do about it.	Ma jirin wax xun oo aan ka qaban karno.
I can't think of anyone better than you.	Ma malayn karo qof kaa fiican.
I know that.	waan ogahay taas .
No one wants to be here.	Qofna ma rabo inuu halkan joogo.
I don't care.	Waxba igama qabo.
I can see what you can see.	Waan arki karaa waxaad arki karto.
It really has someone.	Runtii qof bay leedahay.
There is nothing to say.	Wax loo sheego ma jiraan.
I always had to work hard to get everything.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd inaan si adag u shaqeeyo si aan wax walba u helo.
No one should have known it all.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu wada ogaado.
What is closest to me.	Maxaa ugu dhow i.
She did not speak again.	Mar dambe ma aysan hadlin.
She always refused.	Mar walba way diiday.
It was not the same.	Wax la mid ah ma ahayn.
Yesterday something happened to me.	Shalay ayaa wax yar iga dhacay.
That is the only thing you can do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad sameyn karto.
Everyone, stop what you are doing.	Qof walba, jooji waxaad samaynayso.
In fact, that’s what they do most of the time.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa waxa ay inta badan sameeyaan.
I hope someone can help me here.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof iga caawin karo halkan.
This is very much needed.	Tani waa in si aad ah loo baahan yahay.
It was not close.	Uma dhawaan jirin.
But it would be better.	Laakiin way fiicnaan lahayd.
I knew what was going to happen there.	Waan ogaa waxa halkaas ka dhici doona.
I doubt if there is much to see.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay haddii ay jiraan wax badan oo la arko.
It seems to be true.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid run ah.
I say maybe.	Waxaan leeyahay waa laga yaabaa.
Now I do not know what to do.	Hadda ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayo.
Maybe something else would happen.	Malaha wax kale ayaa dhici lahaa.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono .
Something had to be done, quickly.	Wax ay ahayd in la sameeyo, oo degdeg ah.
I don't want to see it again.	Ma doonayo inaan mar dambe arko.
If so.	Haddii ay sidaas u weyn tahay.
But we must not be.	Laakiin waa in aan noqon.
Not much else.	Wax badan oo kale uma badna.
I can get that again.	Taas mar kale waan heli karaa.
And not much fun, too.	Oo aan xiiso badan, sidoo kale.
I had to be one long ago.	Waxay ahayd inaan mid noqdo waa hore.
I don't want to buy it now.	Ma doonayo inaan hadda iibsado.
You can do everything right.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo sax ah.
I really should.	Runtii waa in aan.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani run maaha.
You may want to.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto.
You can do it again	Mar kale ayaad samayn kartaa
Once we were friends.	Mar waxaan ahayn saaxiibo.
And it was bad.	Oo waxay ahayd wax xun.
No one could talk.	Qofna ma hadli karin.
Just like you are not.	Sida sida aadan ahayn.
This is probably not what you want.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahayn waxaad rabto.
It was all him.	Waxay ahayd isaga oo dhan.
I am no longer a man.	Anigu ma ihi nin mar dambe.
Maybe that's what it is.	Malaha taasi waa waxa uu yahay.
No one will hurt you.	Qofna kuma yeeli doono.
But it’s just like any other job.	Laakiin waa sida shaqo kasta oo kale.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I must be surprised.	Waa in aan la yaabay.
not like him.	ma aha isaga oo kale.
It is available everywhere.	Meel walba waa laga heli karaa.
That is a fact.	Taasi waa mid dhab ah.
Three of them.	Saddex ka mid ah.
There was nothing better to do.	Ma jirin wax ka wanaagsan oo la sameeyo.
Very good friend.	Saaxiib aad u fiican.
This is exactly what it is hard for anyone to afford today.	Tani waa si sax ah waxa ay adag tahay in qof kastaa awoodo maanta.
There is no controversy.	Wax la isku hayaa ma jiraan.
We are very smart.	Aad ayaan u caqli badan nahay.
I think we can see that every day.	Waxaan filayaa inaan taas arki karno maalin kasta.
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
There is no problem, there is nothing permanent.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan, ma jiraan wax joogto ah.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
But they are better than nothing.	Laakiin way ka fiican yihiin waxba.
Everyone was in it.	Qof kastaa wuu ku jiray.
To find out.	Si aad u ogaato.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
I do not understand why this will happen.	Ma fahmin sababta ay taasi u dhici doonto.
He was great.	Wuxuu ahaa mid weyn.
Why would anyone do that?	Muxuu qof sidaas yeeli lahaa?.
That will definitely happen.	Taasi waa hubaal inay dhici doonto.
There will always be someone stopping him.	Mar kasta qof ayaa joojin doona isaga.
I do not want to talk too much about this.	Ma rabo in aan wax badan ka hadlo arrintan.
Don't do it to me.	Ha ii samayn.
She said she was busy.	Waxay sheegtay inay mashquul tahay.
You can't find a job	Shaqo ma heli kartid
Everyone will love it.	Qof walba wuu jeclaan doonaa.
That is yet to come.	Taasi weli way iman.
I will not see.	I arki maayo.
It was small too.	Waxay ahayd mid yar sidoo kale.
Tell her how it is.	U sheeg sida ay tahay.
Nothing! 	Waxba kuma jiraan!
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
No one talks about anything else.	Qofna wax kale kama hadlo.
I don't want any money	Wax lacag ah ma rabo
He looks so good until someone comes up to him.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid aad u wanaagsan ilaa qof ka hor yimaado isaga.
They are at work	Waxay ku jiraan shaqada
It is all true.	Waa run oo dhan.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Maybe he couldn't.	Malaha wuu awoodi waayay.
You said that.	Waad sheegtay taas.
I wanted to see.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko.
Everywhere he went.	Meel walba wuu la baxay.
He did not know why he was here.	Ma uusan garanayn sababta uu halkan u joogo.
But this.	Laakiin kan.
Very busy yet.	Mashquul badan weli.
Surely someone would take it.	Hubaal qof baa qaadan lahaa.
It can really be good.	Runtii wuu fiicnaan karaa.
That is how it has been constant.	Taasi waa sida uu ahaa mid joogto ah.
In fact, even more so.	Dhab ahaantii, xitaa ka sii badan.
That is everything else.	Taasi waa wax kale oo dhan.
He is a very popular person.	Waa qof aad loo jecel yahay.
Maybe eat as well.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in sidoo kale wax cuno.
I have nothing good to say about that.	Ma hayo wax wanaagsan oo aan taas ka sheego.
It was not me.	Ma ahayn aniga.
He was stupid, too.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aan caqli lahayn, sidoo kale.
Otherwise we can do nothing.	Haddii kale waxba ma qaban karno.
I'm afraid so.	Waxaan ka baqayaa sidaas.
Not a little, but a lot.	Ma aha wax yar, laakiin wax badan.
I didn’t think this was too much.	Uma malaynayn in tani ay aad u badan tahay.
I really enjoyed what you do.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay waxaad samayso.
That is very rare.	Taasi waa wax aad u yar.
I just need to know why he doesn’t like me.	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta uusan ii jeclayn.
We will see that.	Waan arki doonaa taas.
The other never does.	Ka kale waligiis ma sameeyo.
I started.	Waxaan bilaabay.
He just didn’t get it.	Kaliya kuma uu helin.
But it may not be true.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan run ahayn.
It's great.	Waa weyn yahay.
It is what we do.	Waa waxa aan samayno.
All will be well.	Dhammaan way fiicnaan doonaan.
But someone must.	Laakiin qof waa inuu.
Now that was nothing.	Hadda taasi waxba ma ahayn.
You need us.	Waad noo baahan tahay.
You can go home	Waxaad aadi kartaa guriga
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
Whenever you want, you can take it back.	Mar kasta oo aad rabto, dib ayaad u qaadan kartaa.
It is just loved.	Kaliya waa la jecel yahay.
you are not in a good place	meel fiican kuma joogto
I certainly do.	Hubaal waan sameeyaa.
That will be very difficult.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u dhib badan.
The only reason is the reason.	Sababta kaliya ayaa ah sababta.
You can't imagine.	Ma malayn kartid.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
That he can find me.	In uu i heli karo.
But something unknown happened.	Laakiin waxyaabo aan la garanayn ayaa dhacay.
I would do it for you	waan kuu samayn lahaa
It was not too difficult.	Ma ahayn mid aad u adag.
But he seems to love it.	Laakiin wuxuu u muuqdaa mid aad u jecel.
It's not just what you look like.	Kaliya maaha sida aad u egtahay.
But he got enough.	Laakiin wuu helay wax ku filan.
She did not believe.	Ma ay rumaysan.
It amazes me.	Waa iga yaab.
I was unemployed.	Waxaan ahaa shaqo la'aan.
Really fast.	Dhab ahaantii aad u degdeg badan.
I came back three times.	Saddex jeer ayaan ku soo noqday.
She was unemployed.	Waxay ahayd shaqo la'aan.
Much after that.	Wax badan oo taas ka dib.
I am just a man.	Waxaan ahay nin kaliya.
If it is nothing, it is nothing.	Haddii aanay waxba ahayn, waxba maaha.
I thought it was a little weird.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay tahay wax yar oo la yaab leh.
Let me tell you there is still a chance.	Aan u sheego in ay weli fursad jirto.
You are a great friend.	Waxaad tahay saaxiib weyn.
He must.	Waa inuu.
Ready to work.	Diyaar u ah inuu shaqeeyo.
Not seen.	Lama arag.
It looks right.	Waxay u egtahay sax .
You haven't done that yet.	Weli ma aadan samayn taas.
Really close, too.	Dhab ahaantii dhow, sidoo kale.
I just wanted to.	Kaliya waxaan rabay.
I told her it could take some time.	Waxaan u sheegay inay qaadan karto xoogaa waqti ah.
I am not now	Hadda ma ihi
tell me someone who loves him.	ii sheeg qof isaga jecel.
I am happy for him.	Waan ku faraxsanahay isaga.
They did not pay.	Wax lacag ah ma ay siin.
No one knows where he lives.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu ku nool yahay.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
Just don't take it.	Kaliya ha qaadan.
I need one more person.	Waxaan u baahanahay hal qof oo kale.
But this again.	Laakiin tan mar kale.
But there is not much to see.	Laakiin wax badan oo la arki karo ma jiraan.
This is not permanent.	Tani ma aha joogto.
I don't think so.	U malayn maayo inay sidaas oo kale tahay.
I just keep it there.	Kaliya halkaas ayaan ku hayaa.
I hope you are happy.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad faraxsan tahay.
But there was something else as well.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jiray sidoo kale.
This is not a difficult idea.	Tani maaha fikrad adag.
No longer.	Ma jiro muddo sidaas u dheer.
I need to stay	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan joogo
It's an idea.	Waa fikrad.
It is not beautiful.	Ma aha qurux.
I already had three.	Waxaan hore u lahaa saddex.
Maybe not you.	Malaha adiga maaha.
Not too bad, really.	Ma aha mid aad u xun, dhab ahaantii.
I did not go.	Ma tagin.
I don't want to know anything about prison.	Ma rabo inaan wax ka ogaado xabsiga.
This is also something they will need to do again.	Tani sidoo kale waa wax ay u baahan doonaan inay mar kale sameeyaan.
No one else wants this.	Qof kale ma rabo kan.
You will love this one.	Waad jeclaan doontaa kan.
It will not happen now.	Ma dhici doonto hadda.
It has been bad for a very long time.	Waxay ahayd mid xun muddo aad u dheer.
I suspect he was alone.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu keligiis ahaa.
Great surprise for everyone.	La yaab weyn qof walba.
I really don't get it.	Runtii ma helo.
He had one.	Mid buu lahaa.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
I know you won't.	Waan ogahay inaadan yeeli doonin.
It is not time.	Ma aha waqti.
You are enough for me.	Waad igu filan tahay aniga.
I can't today.	Maanta ma awoodo.
Close to me.	Aniga ii dhow.
I have nothing else.	Wax kale ma hayo.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd si yaab leh.
She would believe him.	Way rumaysan lahayd isaga.
He will not leave.	Ma bixi doono.
They said nothing.	Waxba uma ay sheegi jirin.
I felt fast	Waxaan dareemay degdeg
This is not correct.	Tani sax uma eka.
I didn’t know how accurate this was.	Maan ogayn sida ay tani sax u tahay.
That's right.	Waa sax.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd mid la yaab leh.
I took it.	Waan ka qaatay.
Just tell me	Kaliya ii sheeg
More will come.	Wax badan ayaa iman doona.
There is not much to say after what happened.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo laga sheego wixii dhacay ka dib.
Everything that has happened has already happened.	Wax kasta oo dhacay ayaa hore u dhacay.
I told him that.	Taas ayaan u sheegay.
But that is not what it is.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa ay tahay.
It looks like it will happen.	Waxay u egtahay inay dhici doonto.
He has to go home.	Waa inuu guriga aado.
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
You don't need him like that.	Uma baahnid isaga oo kale.
He will be fine here.	Wuu ku fiicnaan doonaa halkan.
You can't leave	Ma bixi kartid
But you know you are small.	Laakiin waad ogtahay inaad yar tahay.
I hope you will be fine.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad fiicnaan doonto.
How great.	Sidee u weyn tahay.
No wonder.	La yaab maaha.
This is great, unbelievable.	Tani waa mid weyn, oo aan la rumaysan karin.
It is needed now, today.	Waa loo baahan yahay hadda, maanta.
Probably, maybe.	Malaha, waa laga yaabaa.
He did not talk about it.	Ma uusan ka hadlin.
Here, you.	Halkan, adiga.
He felt something.	Wax buu dareemay.
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh .
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ilaa hadda qofna ma arag.
She lost it.	Way ku wayday.
It is the same for everyone.	Waa isku mid qof walba.
Little chance of that.	Fursad yar oo taas ah.
What a great time together.	Maxaa waqti fiican wada lahaa.
More desirable.	In ka badan la jeclaan karo.
you are a great man.	nin weyn baad tahay.
Great, really.	Weyn, dhab ahaantii.
That was unnecessary.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aan loo baahnayn.
This was the best of the best.	Tani waxay ahayd tan ugu fiican ee ugu fiican.
No location found.	Meel laga helay ma jirin.
More than likely, they will not.	In ka badan sida ay u badan tahay, ma ay yeeli doonaan.
I wonder who it is.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waa kuma.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
If someone could help that would be great.	Haddii qof uu caawin karo taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
I know it very well.	si fiican ayaan u garanayaa.
But no one loves me.	Laakiin qofna aniga ima jecla.
He wondered who she was.	Aad buu ula yaabay cidda ay tahay.
In fact, he had nothing to say even now.	Runtii, ma jirin wax uu sheego xitaa hadda.
It was really amazing.	Runtii waxay ahayd yaab.
But, it is still said.	Laakiin, weli waa la yiri.
I love having it.	Waan jeclahay in aan hayo.
If you do not have too much.	Haddii aadan aad u badan.
This he hopes.	Tani wuxuu rajeynayaa.
That is what we are.	Taasi waa waxa aan nahay.
I don't want to do that.	Ma doonayo inaan taas sameeyo.
And maybe it was one, that.	Oo malaha waxay ahayd mid, taas.
This is not a coincidence.	Tani ma aha wax nasiib ah.
First, this is not true.	Marka hore, tani run maaha.
He should also know that.	Waa inuu sidoo kale ogaado taas.
There are no other things	Ma jiraan waxyaabo kale
There are other things, too.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
It's a great place.	Waa meel fiican.
He would get it.	Wuu heli lahaa.
They are so bad.	Aad bay u xun yihiin.
I was surprised by him.	Waxa aan la yaabay isaga.
I thought you were a friend.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay saaxiib.
First, nothing.	Marka hore, waxba.
It doesn't look like anything has happened.	Wax dhacay uma eka.
Give me some time.	Waqti yar i sii.
One had three.	Mid baa saddex lahaa.
I did not take it.	Maan qaadan.
I won't even talk.	Xitaa ma hadli doono.
He put everything.	Wax walba wuu dhigay.
I saw it differently.	Si kale ayaan u arkay.
It is not a happy place.	Ma aha meel faraxsan.
You can always leave at any time.	Had iyo jeer waad iska bixi kartaa wakhti kasta.
And there was more.	Oo waxaa jiray wax ka badan.
Obviously not.	Sida iska cad ma aha.
He is missing	Waa la waayay
Get me out.	Iga bixi.
But I really know they are not.	Laakiin runtii waan ogahay inaysan ahayn.
No one came back.	Qofna ma soo noqon.
Friend, mar.	Saaxiib, mar.
Now I had no idea.	Hadda wax fikrad ah ma lahayn.
Ah, here it is.	Ah, waa kan.
I will do that.	Waan samayn doonaa taas.
Please don't think it was you.	Fadlan ha u malayn inay adiga ahayd.
There was nothing in it that was not really true.	Ma jirin wax ku jira oo aan run ahaantii run ahayn.
I really enjoyed it too.	Aad ayaan uga helay sidoo kale.
I have nothing against him.	Wax isaga ka dhan ah ma hayo.
Too much.	Si aad u badan.
Me and you as one.	Aniga iyo adiga oo mid ah.
Not sure if I need another one.	Ma hubo inaan mid kale u baahanahay.
That is not the worst thing.	Taasi maaha waxa ugu xun.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
But a lot has happened.	Laakiin waxyaabo badan ayaa dhacay.
You will get something.	Wax baad heli doontaa.
Now, it was like that.	Hadda, waxay ahayd sidaas oo kale.
Everything is false and nothing.	Wax walba waa been oo waxba maaha.
All of this seems familiar.	Dhammaan tani waxay u egtahay mid la yaqaan.
You did what you did.	Waxaad samaysay waxaad ku samaysay.
I need you not to be here now.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaadan hadda halkan joogin.
I got the rest.	Inta kale waan helay.
I got this from you.	Waxaan ka helay tan adiga.
Maybe it was something else.	Malaha waxay ahayd wax kale.
That is, everything.	Taasi waa, wax walba.
It is obvious.	Waa wax iska cad.
He wondered what he was doing.	Waxa uu sameeyo ayuu is waydiiyay.
This, for the most part, is correct.	Tani, inta badan, waa mid sax ah.
She should have been here.	Waxay ahayd inay halkan joogto.
I can do this anywhere.	Meel kasta waan ku samayn karaa tan.
Maybe she would have done better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay si ka wanaagsan samayn lahayd.
She said it was a lie.	Waxay tidhi waa been.
He really didn’t want to have it.	Runtii ma uu doonayn in uu haysto.
There must be something else here, he thought.	Waa inay jiraan wax kale oo halkan ah, ayuu u maleeyay.
It was reportedly not available.	Waxaa la sheegay in la heli waayay.
I was also surprised at first.	Waxa kale oo aan isla yaabay markii hore.
A lot of them.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah.
We were friends at first.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo marka hore.
I asked to see the room.	Waxaan codsaday inaan arko qolka.
You can see this only here.	Waxaad arki kartaa tan halkan kaliya.
We are very.	Waxaan aad u nahay.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono isaga.
It was known to be.	Waa la ogaa inay ahayd.
But that doesn't matter.	Laakiin taasi waxba maaha.
There is no one better than this.	Ma jiro qof ka wanaagsan kan.
Not sure how.	Ma hubo sida.
I thought everyone had.	Waxaan u maleeyay in qof walba lahaa.
Too much to eat.	Aad u badan oo la cuno.
I have made it clear now.	Si cad ayaan hadda u sheegay.
what are you	maxaad tahay .
Tell me everything.	Wax walba ii sheeg.
But what a great place to work.	Laakiin waa maxay meel fiican oo laga shaqeeyo.
I am one of them.	Aniga ayaa ka mid ah.
I have not seen it yet.	Wali ma arag.
He was also very knowledgeable and willing to talk about anything.	Waxa kale oo uu ahaa mid aad u yaqaan oo diyaar u ah inuu ka hadlo wax kasta.
considered so	loo eegay sidaas
I thought that was interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay in taasi ay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
You can't come here	Halkan ma iman kartid
What a day.	Maxaa maalin ah.
you are smart	caqli baad tahay
But he knew that everything was ready for him.	Laakiin wuu ogaa in wax walba ay isaga diyaar u yihiin.
He was a great man too.	Wuxuu ahaa nin weyn sidoo kale.
Everyone in the room did.	Qof kasta oo qolka ku jiray wuu sameeyay.
It really is hard work.	Runtii waa shaqo adag.
He didn't want me to leave.	Ma uusan rabin inaan baxo.
For what it was.	Wixii uu ahaa.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
Maybe he has it better.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu si fiican u haysto.
That does not matter.	Taasi ma samayso.
This is really true.	Runtii tani waa run.
I am not someone else.	Ma ihi qof kale.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
But he could not.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
But it would be nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma ahaan lahayd.
He is still there.	Wali ma joogo.
But very beautiful.	Laakiin aad u qurux badan.
It can't end there.	Halkaas kuma dhammaan karto.
I became nobody.	Waxaan noqday qofna.
That was beautiful.	In ay ahayd mid qurux badan.
I can do it quickly.	Waxaan ku samayn karaa si degdeg ah.
I must.	waa inaan .
She can be a friend to anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa saaxiib qof kasta.
Have a good meal.	Qaado cunto wanaagsan.
He wants to know everything.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ogaado wax walba.
Now it is not you.	Hadda ma aha adiga.
Do the work.	Qabo shaqada.
This is interesting.	Tani waa waxyaabo xiiso leh.
Does he really think so.	Runtii ma sidaas buu u malaynayaa.
I have seen it many times.	Mar iyo jeer ayaan arkay.
Shortly afterwards it happened.	Wax yar ka dib wuu dhacay.
All she had to do was get enough trouble.	Waxa kaliya ee ay ahayd inay samayso waxay ahayd dhibaato ku filan.
I don't want to eat.	Ma rabo inaan wax cuno.
He was an adult.	Wuxuu ahaa qof weyn.
I know she has.	Waan ogahay inay leedahay.
But it was real.	Laakiin dhab buu ahaa.
It looks very interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
We will do it.	Waanu samayn doonaa.
But, that's what it is.	Laakiin, waa waxa ay tahay.
I looked at myself again.	Mar kale ayaan is eegay.
We are free.	Waxaan nahay lacag la'aan.
There were three of them now.	Waxaa jiray saddex ka mid ah hadda.
As I wish.	Sida aan doono.
That was done.	Taasi waa la sameeyay.
The reason will now be stated.	Sababta hadda waa la sheegi doonaa.
You did everything else.	Waxaad samaysay wax kasta oo kale.
You can do it anyway.	Waxaad samayn kartaa si kasta.
I didn't know what to do.	Wax aan ku sameeyo maan garanayn.
He did not speak much.	In badan ma uusan hadlin.
He slammed the door behind him.	Albaabka ayuu dib ugu dhacay.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
But there is no promise.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax ballan ah.
But this was a good thing.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
I know it very well	si fiican ayaan u garanayaa
I never got to tell people.	Weligay ma helin inaan dadka u sheego.
That probably was too.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay sidoo kale ahayd.
There is a lot of fun here.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo xiiso leh halkan.
It is something new.	Waa wax cusub.
He sure took a bad time to pick this up.	Wuxuu hubaa inuu qaatay waqti xun si uu tan u soo qaado.
And not the same.	Oo isku mid maaha.
Which isn’t too much.	Taas oo aan ahayn mid aad u badan.
After all it was still a little.	Dib markii ay weli wax yar ahayd.
I will not go to him.	Uma tagi doono isaga.
I didn’t think it would still be here.	Uma malaynayn inay weli halkan ahaan doonto.
He wanted to know everything about us.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax walba naga ogaado.
it doesn't look good	si fiican uma eka
Like school.	Sida dugsiga.
It is the best.	Waa tan ugu fiican.
I will never do it for him.	Weligay ma yeeli doono isaga.
Maybe another man.	Malaha nin kale.
You still love him.	Wali waad jeceshahay isaga.
Good thing, he thought.	Wax wanaagsan, ayuu u maleeyay.
Do not do the same.	Wax la mid ah ha samayn.
Obviously not.	Waxaa cad in aysan ahayn.
No one is talking.	Qofna lama hadlo.
I look forward to seeing him alive soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan arko isaga oo nool mar dhow.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
That's what it is.	Waa waxa uu yahay.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
Give it to me.	I sii.
A very happy man.	Nin aad u faraxsan.
No one else does this.	Qof kale ma sameeyo kan.
He should have been there.	Waxay ahayd inuu halkaas joogo.
She did not want him to do that.	Ma ay rabin inuu sidaas sameeyo.
What to do at home.	Waxa aad ku samayn lahayd guriga.
It was very difficult.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
Maybe that's true.	Malaha taasi waa run.
You are much wiser than he is.	Aad baad uga caqli badan tahay isaga.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.	Ma hubo in tani ay tahay fikrad fiican iyo in kale.
Whatever she wanted, well, she didn't get it.	Wax kasta oo ay rabto, si fiican, ma helin.
They are things.	Waa waxyaabo.
There was no major problem	Ma jirin dhibaato weyn
I got lucky	Waxaan ku helay nasiib
Maybe that's enough.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku filan tahay.
That does not exist today.	Taas maanta ma jirto.
Exactly, there were three.	Si sax ah, waxaa jiray saddex.
He did even more.	Xitaa wax ka badan ayuu sameeyay.
He thinks he has.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inuu haysto.
He is back now.	Hadda ayuu ka soo noqday.
But there is a lot going on here.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo halkan ka socda.
You will be.	Waxaad noqon doontaa.
He didn't need to know yet.	Uma baahnayn inuu ogaado weli.
It's amazing to see.	Waa yaab in la arko.
This is less complicated than it looks.	Tani way ka dhib yar tahay sida ay u egtahay.
You can do the same.	Waxaad samayn kartaa sidaas oo kale.
That is not true today.	Taasi run maaha maanta.
Nothing has come out yet.	Wax hadda soo baxay ma jiraan.
I love that.	Waan jeclahay taas.
Good thing here.	Wax fiican halkan.
A very strange man.	Nin aad u yaab badan.
I would say something.	Wax baan ku odhan lahaa.
He needs it.	Wuu u baahan yahay.
I have said it before.	Mar hore ayaan u sheegay.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Malaha waxa ku jira.
Maybe everyone has something to learn.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in qof kastaa haysto wax uu barto.
You know, but little.	Waad ogtahay, laakiin yar.
They are like we are.	Waxay la mid yihiin inaan nahay.
It doesn't seem too complicated.	Uma eka mid aad u adag.
There is nothing better you can do for him.	Ma jiro wax ka fiican oo aad u qaban karto isaga.
It has always been amazing.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd yaab.
You can see that here.	Taas waxaad ku arki kartaa halkan.
He seemed to not know how to speak.	Waxa uu u muuqday in aanu garanayn in uu hadlo.
There is, of course, nothing more to be said in the near future.	Ma jiro, runtii, wax ka badan oo la sheegi karo waqti dhow.
Stop doing it all.	Jooji samaynta dhammaan.
I would pay	waan bixin lahaa
I didn’t have enough.	Ma haysan wax ku filan.
And you know, he still had.	Oo waad ogtahay, inuu weli lahaa.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
I did some work at once.	Waxaan sameeyay xoogaa shaqo hal mar.
First of all it is the best.	Marka hore waa kan ugu fiican.
It was the right thing to do once.	Waxay ahayd wax sax ah hal mar.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
Lots of trouble.	Dhibaato badan.
I like it a bit.	Jeclahay in ay xoogaa yar.
I left the place	waan ka baxay meesha
Everyone looked.	Qof kastaa wuu eegay.
He looked at you.	Wuu ku eegay.
Nothing to say.	Wax la sheego ma jiro.
But you will get more.	Laakiin wax badan ayaad heli doontaa.
That was some time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd muddo ka hor.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
I don't have to do this.	Ma aha inaan tan sameeyo.
You did it three years ago and you do it now.	Waxaad samaysay saddex sano ka hor oo aad hadda sameyso.
Everything I do.	Wax kasta oo aan sameeyo.
He really liked it.	Runtii wuu ka helay.
And not before.	Oo aan ka hor.
He could not help much.	Aad ayuu u caawin waayay.
I don't understand how anyone can do that.	Ma fahmin sida qof u samayn karo taas.
That he found me.	In uu iga helay.
I know you don't have any more food.	Waan ogahay inaadan haysan cunto dambe.
It will take you a long time.	Waxay ku qaadan doontaa waqti dheer.
She was very smart and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u caqli badan oo qurux badan.
I took it.	Aniga ayaa qaatay.
A little too long.	Wax yar ayaa aad u dheer.
He was always with her.	Mar walba wuu la joogay.
Tom also clearly looked better.	Tom ayaa sidoo kale si cad u muuqday mid ka fiican.
But it is money.	Laakiin waa lacag.
Not only that.	Kaliya sidaas maaha.
This is really amazing.	Runtii tani waa yaab.
I have nothing here.	Waxba halkan kuma hayo.
I think everyone knows that.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof walba ogyahay taas.
It was not a problem, it was me.	Dhib ma ahayn ee waa aniga.
It was really a beautiful place.	Runtii waxay ahayd meel qurux badan.
Anyone we can make new.	Qof kasta oo aan samayn karno cusub.
He is with you wherever you are.	Meel kasta oo aad joogto wuu kula joogaa.
I wanted to be there.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas joogo.
And that you are sorry.	Iyo in aad ka xun tahay.
All in all, I am really happy.	Dhammaan, runtii waan ku faraxsanahay.
No one will see it.	Cidna ma arki doono.
He looked back at the door.	Albaabka ayuu dib u eegay.
I can't do it anymore, I don't want to do anything else.	Mar dambe ma samayn karo, ma doonayo inaan wax kale sameeyo.
I will never, ever, ever do that.	Weligay, weligay, ma samayn doono taas.
Not just me.	Aniga kaliya maaha.
The rest may not.	Inta kale ma laga yaabaa.
I will not stay here again.	Ma sii joogi doono halkan mar dambe.
Everyone else is.	Qof kasta oo kale waa.
Where he always went.	Meesha uu mar walba tagi jiray.
Great place.	Meel weyn.
It’s hard, but obviously not.	Way adag tahay, laakiin si cad maaha.
There is no luck.	Nasiib ma jiro.
He said he really needed to talk to me.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu runtii u baahan yahay in uu ila hadlo.
No one wants to buy it.	Qofna ma rabo inuu iibsado.
Nowhere else is it the same.	Meel kale oo u dhow isku mid maaha.
Accompanying someone else.	Qof kale la socda.
Everyone was impressed.	Qof walba wuu la dhacay.
Nothing came of it.	Waxba uma soo bixin.
You wonder what it will do.	Waxaad la yaabanahay waxa ay samayn doonto.
Something he once said to someone.	Wax uu mar qof ku yidhi.
What a mess!	Maxaa xun!.
This is done here.	Tan waxaa lagu sameeyay halkan.
It probably won't happen.	Waxay u badan tahay ma dhici doonto.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii waa qurux.
I wonder what it is.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waa maxay.
Everyone had something to do with everyone else.	Qof kastaa wax buu ku lahaa qof kasta oo kale.
You may not like me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan i jeclayn.
Now this was a lot more.	Hadda tani waxay ahayd wax badan oo kale.
You need it	Waad u baahan tahay
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
This can be a problem.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
You know you are.	Waad ogtahay inaad tahay.
He is not a real person.	Ma aha qof dhab ah.
This is amazing.	Tani waa yaab .
That is the only thing you will need to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan doonto inaad ogaato.
No one should tell me.	Qofna waa inuu ii sheego.
I'll see you shortly.	wax yar ka dib ayaan ku arki doonaa.
It didn't bother her, he decided.	Dhib kuma ay siin, ayuu go'aansaday.
You have an idea.	Waxaad leedahay fikrad.
I hope it will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ku caawin doonto.
I'm so sorry I didn't find you.	Aad baan uga xumahay inaanan ku helin.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I looked at him intently.	Aad baan u eegay isaga.
That is the same thing.	Taasi waa wax la mid ah.
It doesn’t have to be that hard.	Ma aha inay sidaas u adag tahay.
It was all over me.	Waxay ahayd aniga oo dhan.
We do not do that.	Taas ma samayno.
He will not say.	Ma uu odhan maayo.
I can't tell you anymore.	Mar dambe ma sheegi karo.
He will come again soon.	Mar kale ayuu iman doonaa dhawaan.
He is very smart.	Aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay.
There was a car.	Waxaa jiray baabuur.
He really knows that.	Runtii taas wuu garanayaa.
Something great.	Wax aad u weyn.
But he knew better.	Laakiin si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
I love you so much	Aad ayaan kuu jeclahay
I never wanted anything else.	Weligay wax kale ma rabin.
The only thing you can do is what you can do.	Waxa kaliya ee aad sameyn karto waa waxa aad sameyn karto.
It had nothing to do with it.	Wax shaqo ah kuma ay lahayn.
I guess he’s not a bad guy after all.	Waxaan filayaa inuusan ahayn nin xun ka dib oo dhan.
Maybe something similar happened here.	Malaha wax la mid ah ayaa halkan ka dhacay.
This alone is true.	Tani kaliya ayaa run ah.
After a while he came back and said.	Muddo ka dib ayuu soo noqday oo yidhi.
They did not succeed.	Ma aysan guulaysan.
But she realized it wasn't right.	Laakiin way ogaatay in aanay sax ahayn.
He just loves him.	Kaliya wuu jecel yahay isaga.
A man needs this.	Nin baa kan u baahan.
I need	waxaan u baahanahay
I just have to have it.	Kaliya waa inaan haysto.
Always very difficult.	Had iyo jeer aad u adag.
You do not have to know.	Ma aha inaad ogaato.
It looks like more.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid ka sii badan.
I have to do it	Waa inaan sameeyaa
I will stay at work forever.	Weligay shaqada ayaan joogi doonaa.
He looks smart.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid caqli badan.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Ah, what else.	Ah, maxaa kale.
It can happen at any time.	Waxay dhici kartaa wakhti kasta.
For me this is correct.	Aniga ahaan tani waa sax.
It's bad here	Way xun tahay halkan
Maybe this is not a good idea after all.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani aysan ahayn fikrad wanaagsan ka dib oo dhan.
You will be out soon.	Dhawaan ayaad ka soo bixi doontaa.
No one does anything.	Qofna waxba ma sameeyo.
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
Looks great.	U muuqday mid aad u wanaagsan.
It is too early to tell.	Way goor hore tahay in la sheego.
It was all fun.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
This should not be.	Tani waa inaysan noqon.
I did not know what had happened to him.	Ma garanayn waxa ku dhacay.
I think it's a big deal.	Wax weyn bay ila tahay .
Everyone thinks he is great.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u maleynayaa inuu weyn yahay.
Always, nothing.	Mar kasta, waxba.
It will go away	Way bixi doontaa
Someone was always there.	Qof ayaa had iyo jeer joogay halkaas.
I thought.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan.
I'm really happy.	Runtii waan ku faraxsanahay.
Maybe it was me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aniga ila ahayd.
It wasn’t much, but it was something.	Ma ahayn wax badan, laakiin waxay ahayd wax.
You just can’t do anything like that.	Kaliya ma samayn kartid wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I think it is very good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u fiican tahay.
There was no way he couldn’t take it.	Ma jirin si uu u qaadan waayay.
But no one really existed.	Laakiin qofna run ahaantii ma jirin.
This is enough for me.	Tani waa igu filan tahay.
We will have a good time.	Waxaan heli doonaa waqti fiican.
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad fiican.
Do not give anything.	Waxba ha siin.
There was.	Waxaa jiray .
This is a terrible thing.	Tani waa wax aad u xun.
There is nothing more difficult.	Ma jiraan wax ka sii adag.
That was enough.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa ku filan.
It's so bad.	Aad bay uga xun tahay.
That is not to say that it is correct.	Taasi maaha in ay sax tahay.
He said he would do the same.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu sidaas oo kale samayn doono.
he was surprised.	wuu yaabay.
It was given.	Waa la siiyay.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
This is hard to do.	Tani waa adag tahay in la sameeyo.
I went into the house.	Waxaan galay guriga.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
He is really more than we are.	Runtii wuu naga badan yahay.
You need to.	Aad u baahan tahay inaad.
I was lucky to be there.	Nasiib ayaan lahaa inaan halkaas joogo.
She can talk to him.	Way la hadli kartaa.
Now he had nothing.	Hadda waxba ma uu haysan.
I decided not to go back.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaanan dib ugu noqon.
It doesn't look like anyone else is going there.	Qof kale uma eka inuu halkaas tago.
It is not food.	Ma aha cunto.
Everyone did.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyay.
That she had.	In ay lahayd.
I didn't give much.	In badan maan siin.
This is not very common.	Tani aad uma badna.
Constantly and consistently.	Si joogto ah oo joogto ah.
I wish we could be.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan noqon karno.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay taas.
I think it's good all the time.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay fiican tahay mar kasta.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
It can't be so bad.	Ma noqon karto mid sidaas u xun.
He certainly did not speak to me.	Waxa hubaal ah in aanu aniga igu hadlin.
He owed a lot.	In badan ayuu ku lahaa.
All we need is a good man.	Waxa kaliya ee aan u baahanahay waa nin wanaagsan.
She really promised she would.	Waxay si dhab ah u ballan qaaday inay sameyn doonto.
I'm sure of this.	Waan hubaa tan.
I only heard about him once.	Hal mar ayaan ka maqlay isaga.
Here it is, friend.	Waa kan, saaxiib.
I know what it looks like.	Waan ogahay sida ay u egtahay.
Obviously, it will not happen.	Sida cad, ma dhici doonto.
We love you there.	Waxaan ku jecel nahay halkaas.
It really wasn't a lie.	Runtii ma ahayn been.
He saw everything.	Wax walba wuu arkay.
I do not understand why.	Ma fahmin sababta.
To talk.	In la wada hadlo.
I could not see anything.	Waxba maan arki karin.
I will make something for you to eat.	Waxaan kuu samayn doonaa wax aad cunto.
She was more than ready.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan diyaar.
He had nowhere else to go.	Meel kale oo uu aado ma uu haysan.
I can't believe that.	Ma rumaysan karo taas.
It didn't matter if there was anything.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn in ay wax jiraan iyo in kale.
Here is another one.	Waa kan mid kale.
You may not have it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan haysan.
Probably a bad idea.	Malaha fikrad xun.
We need to make room for it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan meel u samayno.
It's really weird, that's it.	Dhab ahaantii waa yaab, taasi waa.
It is something you have to do.	Waa wax ay tahay inaad sameyso.
She would come.	Way iman lahayd.
She likes to do that, you know.	Way jeceshahay inay taas samayso, waad ogtahay.
It's bad if we do.	Way xun tahay haddii aan samayno.
But there is something else, too.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jira, sidoo kale.
I can't say anything good about him.	Wax fiican kama sheegi karo isaga.
She has everything they need.	Waxay leedahay wax kasta oo ay u baahan yihiin.
I had some food.	Waxaan lahaa xoogaa cunto ah.
It is definitely available	Hubaal waa la heli karaa
And very real.	Oo aad u dhab ah.
You can't imagine.	Ma malayn kartid .
Both are.	Labaduba waa.
It really was.	Runtii waxay ahayd.
Let it do.	Ha sameyso.
It is unknown.	Waa wax aan la garanayn.
But now here it is.	Laakiin hadda waa kan.
When everything was set, he still hadn't come back.	Markii wax walba la dhigay, weli dib uma soo noqon.
But I will give my best.	Laakiin waxaan siin doonaa sida ugu fiican.
But even this is not true.	Laakiin xitaa tani run maaha.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I did not understand what you were	Maan fahmin waxaad ahayd
Everyone did the same.	Qof kastaa sidaas oo kale ayuu sameeyay.
I am so glad you are here !.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto!.
Not right yet.	Sax maaha weli.
It had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
But you will be fine.	Laakiin waad fiicnaan doontaa.
It wasn’t making money.	Ma ahayn lacag samaynta.
But there were other things as well.	Laakiin waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
But he is good at it.	Laakiin wuu ku fiican yahay.
It was not the same.	Isku mid ma ahayn.
The French have already done this.	Faransiiska ayaa hore u sameeyay tan.
It sounds like work, now.	Waxay u egtahay shaqo, hadda.
But nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma jiraan.
But no one was present.	Laakiin qofna ma joogin.
That sounds great.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid weyn.
I, as a person, used to be.	Anigu, mid ahaan, sidaas ayaan ahaan jiray.
Let's do it again.	Aan mar kale samayno.
I can’t think of that a little bit.	Ma malayn karo taas in yar.
It will be very difficult.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I am not, now.	Ma ihi, hadda.
But it was rejected.	Laakiin waa la diiday.
it is said.	waxaa la leeyahay.
One of us.	Mid naga mid ah.
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
He would not come.	Ma iman lahayn.
I took the job seriously.	Shaqada si dhab ah ayaan u qaatay.
That may not be true.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in taasi aysan sax ahayn.
She would love to.	Way jeclaan lahayd.
I don't like to talk to him.	Ma jecli inaan la hadlo isaga.
Now I am unemployed.	Hadda waxaan ahay shaqo la'aan.
I don't know that.	Ma garanayo taas.
Maybe he took one.	Malaha mid buu qaatay.
I knew it well.	Si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
No one can do this.	Qofna ma samayn karo tan.
I still don't understand.	Wali ma fahmin.
I am always with you.	Mar walba waan kula joogaa.
I love you.	waan kugu jeclahay.
New things have come up.	Waxyaabo cusub ayaa soo galay.
Not everyone does, you know.	Qof walba ma sameeyo, waad ogtahay.
I hope this will help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
But she was not ready.	Laakiin diyaar uma ahayn.
They are really good.	Dhab ahaantii way fiican yihiin.
I have always been lucky to find a job.	Waxaan mar walba nasiib u lahaa inaan shaqo helo.
I am a very tough guy.	Waxaan ahay nin aad u adag.
They are really good.	Runtii way fiican yihiin.
I can't why.	Ma awoodo sababta.
That is not true	Taasi run maaha
Ah! 	Ah!
Now more than ever.	Hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
This has already been done.	Tan hore ayaa loo sameeyay.
I really know what he does.	Runtii waan garanayaa waxa uu sameeyo.
Now I am at the door	Hadda waxaan ku jiraa albaabka
This was something else again.	Tani waxay ahayd wax kale mar kale.
I don't have much money.	Lacag badan ma haysto.
A lot closer, really.	Wax badan u dhow, dhab ahaantii.
This he probably did.	Tani malaha wuu sameeyay.
I know, everyone says so.	Waan ogahay, qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay sidaas.
He heard something.	Wax buu maqlay.
But it is very bad.	Laakiin aad bay u xun tahay.
But one did.	Laakiin mid ayaa sameeyay.
That is, so far.	Taasi waa, ilaa hadda.
And everyone else.	Iyo dadka kale oo dhan.
But it is home.	Laakiin waa guriga.
They may not be here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan halkan joogin.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas.
Maybe it will help, maybe.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawin doonto, malaha.
But she is very smart.	Laakiin aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
If you don’t, really, really should you.	Haddii aadan samayn, runtii, runtii waa inaad.
This is rejected.	Tani waa la diiday.
But he did not give up.	Laakiin ma uu siin.
This was amazing.	Tani waxay ahayd yaab.
It is very bad that someone has been hit by a car.	Aad bay u xun tahay in qof uu ku dhacay baabuur.
I think you are the best.	Waxaan filayaa inaad tahay kan ugu fiican.
As a man.	Nin ahaan.
Great day.	Maalin weyn.
I left.	Waan ka tagay.
Maybe it's me.	Malaha waa aniga.
I am just like you	waxaan ahay adiga oo kale
I don't think so.	U malayn maayo.
This is what he came for.	Tani waa waxa uu u yimid.
No one wants to be told what to do.	Qofna ma rabo in loo sheego waxa la sameeyo.
I had one job.	Waxaan lahaa hal shaqo.
This is not always the case.	Mar walba sidaas maaha.
It really is true.	Runtii waa run.
But this is more than that.	Laakiin tani waa ka badan.
I'm scared.	Waxaan ka baqayaa.
But the prison was.	Laakiin xabsiga ayaa ahaa.
I will not do it.	Ma yeeli doono.
None of me.	Ma jiro aniga.
Like who we are and what we do.	Sida cidda aan nahay iyo waxa aan samayno.
I also know why you are there.	Sidoo kale waan garanayaa sababta aad halkaas u joogto.
That was not very good.	Taasi ma ahayn mid aad u fiican.
He was very similar to you.	Aad buu kula mid ahaa.
In fact, he would have expected that.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu filan lahaa taas.
It can't be good, that's for sure.	Wax wanaagsan ma noqon karo, taasi waa hubaal.
That is the only thing you can be.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad noqon karto.
Maybe I don't know.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan garanayn.
And he is ready to do it again.	Oo uu diyaar u yahay inuu mar kale sameeyo.
He did, well.	Wuu sameeyay, si fiican.
She will never see him again.	Mar dambe ma ay arki doonto.
It can be done	Waa la samayn karaa
And now, he's gone.	Oo hadda, wuu baxay.
She said she would be there.	Waxay sheegtay inay halkaas joogi doonto.
In fact, it doesn't look pretty.	Dhab ahaantii, uma eka in ay qurux badan tahay.
I'm afraid he is.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inuu yahay.
But it can be even worse.	Laakiin waxay noqon kartaa mid aad uga xun.
He hasn't come back since.	Ma soo noqon tan iyo markii.
There just aren't.	Kaliya ma jiraan.
Not really, he said.	Runtii maaha, ayuu yidhi.
What a beautiful man.	Maxaa nin qurux badan.
I suspect they are not.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inaysan ahayn.
I will not stay.	Ma joogi doono.
I started eating again.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan mar kale cuno.
He may do whatever he promises to do.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu sameeyo wax kasta oo uu u ballan qaaday inuu samayn doono.
Well said enough of this.	Si fiican ayaa loo sheegay oo ku filan tan.
We are just ready	Waxaan nahay sidii diyaar
He looked bad.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid xun.
It is not always a bad thing.	Had iyo jeer maaha wax xun.
That is a long time for me.	Taasi waa waqti dheer aniga.
But it was very interesting.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I know you will do a great job.	Waan ogahay inaad shaqo weyn ku qaban doonto.
I would like to help	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan caawiyo
He looked happy.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
I know what he can do.	Waan ogahay waxa uu samayn karo.
That is not the case.	Taasi sidaas maaha.
That is what you are.	Taasi waa waxa aad tahay.
It should, obviously.	Waa inay, si cad.
I was tough.	Waxaan ahaa mid adag.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
.	.
It was a big problem.	Waxay ahayd dhib weyn.
It is all very beautiful.	Dhammaan waa mid aad u qurux badan.
Now, tell me this.	Hadda, tan ii sheeg.
I think that's right.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay sax tahay.
That is a terrible thing.	Taasi waa wax aad u xun.
Someone who loves me.	Qof i jecel.
He remained a man.	Nin ahaan buu sii jiray.
I was unable to figure this out.	Waan awoodi waayay inaan ogaado tan.
This was not a problem.	Tani dhib ma ahayn.
She did not speak for a long time.	Muddo dheer ma ay hadlin.
An earlier problem.	Dhibaato hore.
I will do that again.	Taas mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa.
But it did not stop.	Laakiin ma joojin.
You must be new here.	Waa inaad halkan ku cusub tahay.
It really wasn’t hard work.	Runtii ma ahayn shaqo adag.
I want you to know me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad i ogaato.
Not much.	Uma badna.
Not me.	Aniga ma aha.
All well there.	Dhammaan si fiican halkaas.
And so it is here.	Oo sidaas waa halkan.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
I know we are.	Waan ogahay inaan nahay.
He took it quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u qaatay.
Every day, someone was.	Maalin kasta, qof ayaa ahaa.
He is back.	Wuu soo noqday.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
It was not me.	Aniga ma ahayn.
Everyone is really a friend.	Qof walba runtii waa saaxiib.
But you can help.	Laakiin waad ku caawin kartaa.
He has a job.	Waxa uu leeyahay shaqo.
I don't know if you like me back.	Ma garanayo inaad i jeceshahay dib.
I'm happy to help.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay caawiso.
But it is always so.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waa sidaas.
I have seen it often.	Inta badan waan arkay.
They all love me.	Dhammaan way i jecel yihiin.
One fell near me.	Mid ka mid ah ayaa ku dhacay meel ii dhow.
Not much to see.	Wax badan in la arko ma aha.
What happened now.	Maxaa dhacay hadda.
That someone else could be.	In qof kale uu noqon karo.
I have nothing to do here.	Ma hayo wax aan halkan ku sameeyo.
Today is worse than yesterday, but better tomorrow.	Maanta waa ka xun tahay shalay, laakiin ka wanaagsan berri.
I'm sure tomorrow will be everything.	Waxaan hubaa in berri ay wax walba ahaan doonaan .
The house is abandoned, now.	Guriga waa laga tagay, hadda.
I think it would be three today.	Waxaan filayaa inuu maanta saddex ahaan lahaa.
They have not seen me yet.	Wali ima ay arag.
You can find another man.	Waxaad ku heli kartaa nin kale.
Something similar, really.	Wax la mid ah, runtii.
She did not want to do this.	Ma ay rabin inay tan samayso.
It can be fun.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid xiiso leh.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
Hold me.	I qabo.
No one knows me here.	Qofna kuma garanayo halkan.
I couldn’t, for a long time.	Ma awoodin, muddo dheer.
But I’m so glad you did it only once, friend.	Laakiin aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad samaysay hal mar kaliya, saaxiib.
But it had to be done.	Laakiin waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
And she said it wasn't true.	Oo waxay tidhi run maaha.
Live well, though there is everything.	Nool oo wanaagsan, in kasta oo ay jiraan wax kasta.
Maybe he will leave.	Malaha wuu bixi doonaa.
We will help you if you want.	Waan ku caawin doonaa haddii aad rabto.
Several other men entered.	Dhowr nin oo kale ayaa soo galay.
I think, ah, maybe here.	Waxaan u maleynayaa, ah, malaha halkan.
The latter is the most common.	Tan dambe waa tan ugu badan.
It was a real surprise.	Waxay ahayd yaab dhab ah.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
We are what I think, to say the least.	Waxaan nahay waxa aan u malaynayo, si loo sheego.
Maybe he is one of them.	Malaha wuu ka mid yahay.
Everyone.	Qof kasta oo dhan.
I won't even go there.	Xitaa halkaas ma tagi doono.
They haven't been here much longer.	Ma aysan joogin halkan in badan runtii.
I don't want to talk to anyone.	Ma rabo inaan cidna u hadlo.
He became very difficult.	Wuxuu noqday mid aad u adag.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ma garanayo waxa aan ka sameeyo arrintan.
But I will win.	Laakiin waan guulaysan doonaa.
Much is clear.	In badan ayaa cad.
That it will end.	In ay dhammaan doonto.
It was lucky you weren’t out yet.	Waxay ahayd nasiib inaadan weli soo bixin.
It is also a lie.	Sidoo kale waa been.
I was lucky.	Nasiib ayaan helay.
I would love to be there.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaas joogo.
I put it.	Waan dhigay.
Nothing big.	Wax weyn ma jiraan.
Not very friendly.	Aad uma saaxiib.
I need a job	Waxaan u baahanahay shaqo
I know he was.	Waan ogahay inuu ahaa.
He was constant.	Waxa uu ahaa mid joogto ah.
The rest will come.	Inta kale way iman doontaa.
It's something you said before.	Waa wax aad hore u sheegtay.
He looked back.	Dib buu u eegay.
Good job, everyone !.	Shaqo fiican, qof walba!.
It certainly was.	Waxaa hubaal ahaa.
No one is here.	Qofna halkan ma joogo.
It's great.	Waa mid weyn.
There is no way he is not present.	Ma jirto si uusan u joogin.
In fact, he did not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma uusan lahayn.
It is the same everywhere.	Waa isku mid meel walba.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
I would love to work with you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan kula shaqeeyo
Only once, please.	Kaliya hal mar, fadlan.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
I do not do this.	Anigu ma sameeyo tan.
I didn't want to know more about it.	Ma rabin inaan wax badan ka ogaado.
You have to have a lover, he says.	Waa in aad leedahay qof wax jecel, ayuu yidhi.
You are a very smart man.	Nin caqli badan baa tahay.
It's all restarted	Dhammaan waa dib loo bilaabay
It was hard, if not invisible.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag, haddii aan la arki karin.
I don't like you.	kuma jecla.
Runtii arag.	Runtii arag.
I have to go to work	Waa inaan shaqo tago
One came to me.	Mid baa ii yimid.
I hope you do the right thing.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sameyso mid sax ah.
I'm not doing anything right.	Wax wanaagsan ma samaynayo.
I'll tell you how to get there.	Waxaan kuu sheegi doonaa sida loo tago halkaas.
All in all, a great car.	Dhammaan, baabuur weyn.
Home like everything.	Guriga sida wax walba.
I would love to do it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa in la sameeyo.
This is nothing new.	Tani ma aha wax cusub.
Pay for it.	Wax ka bixi.
There was no urgency at all.	Ma jirin wax degdeg ah oo dhan.
She was like a friend to me.	Waxay ii ahayd sidii saaxiib.
It certainly was.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu ahaa.
I love good food	Waxaan jeclahay cunto wanaagsan
Everyone seems to like it.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu jecel yahay.
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay.
And true.	Oo run ah .
This is bad, bad, bad.	Tani waa xun, xun, xun.
This is a bad problem.	Tani waa dhibaato xun.
He didn't have to say anything else.	Ma ahayn inuu wax kale sheego.
I do not understand	Ma fahmin
Much more accurate today.	Wax badan oo sax ah maanta.
I don't eat much.	Wax badan ma cuno.
But you need to know what is going on there.	Laakiin waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato waxa halkaas ka socda.
It was free.	Waxay ahayd lacag la'aan.
Obviously he is.	Waxaa cad inuu yahay.
I was beautiful to him.	Waxaan u ahaa qurux isaga.
This will not be immediate.	Tani ma noqon doonto mid degdeg ah.
He was definitely right.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu sax ahaa.
Please can you tell me how to do it.	Fadlan ma ii sheegi kartaa sida loo sameeyo.
But this should not be.	Laakiin tani waa in aanay noqon.
He looked up.	Wuu eegay.
Let me get it again.	Aan mar kale helo.
That will be very difficult.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
I know it can happen.	Waan ogahay inay dhici karto.
You found me going.	Adiga ayaa i helay oo socda.
How strange, he thought.	Sidee la yaab leh, ayuu u maleeyay.
Otherwise, that’s right, too.	Haddii kale, taasi waa sax, sidoo kale.
It was a beautiful place.	Waxay ahayd meel qurux badan.
It was impossible.	Waxay ahayd wax aan dhici karin.
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
I really don't even know what to do.	Runtii xitaa ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
He knew very well.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
John did.	Yooxanaa wuu sameeyay.
I couldn't do it.	Waan qaban waayay.
He could not even see.	Xitaa ma uu arki karin.
A little lack.	Wax yar oo la'aan ah.
In fact, this is going to be very, very true.	Runtii, tani waxay noqon doontaa mid aad iyo aad run u ah.
Maybe more than a day.	Maalin laga yaabaa in ka badan.
No one won.	Qofna ma guulaysan.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
But, really, this is not a problem.	Laakiin, dhab ahaantii, tani dhib maaha.
Nothing ever came of it.	Waligiis waxba kama iman.
Not just me.	Ma aha aniga oo kaliya.
No one and all.	Qofna iyo dhammaan.
You can take anything.	Waxaad qaadan kartaa wax kasta.
It was something that could be done.	Waxay ahayd wax la samayn karo.
Not people like me.	Ma aha dadka aniga oo kale ah.
Not wanted.	Lama rabin.
Live all you want.	Nool oo dhan waxaad rabto.
I think this is all.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay dhan tahay.
Lots of good things came out of it.	Waxyaabo badan oo wanaagsan ayaa ka yimid.
Little was said.	Wax yar baa la odhan jiray.
Don't misunderstand me.	Ha i fahmin.
Nothing now.	Wax hadda ma jiraan.
Another, strike.	Mid kale, shaqo joojin.
I felt the same way.	Waxaan dareemay isla sidaas oo kale.
I thought he loved you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu ku jecel yahay.
I don't like work.	Ma jecla shaqada.
Here it is.	Waa kan .
They are now.	Waxay hadda yihiin.
But this is not always desirable.	Laakiin tani mar walba ma aha mid la jecel yahay.
I am happy to help	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan caawiyo
But this did not pay off.	Laakiin tani waxba ma bixin.
Enough of this.	Ku filan tan.
I got out and came back.	Waan soo baxay oo waan soo noqday.
He came back to that over and over again.	Mar kale iyo mar kale ayuu taas ku soo noqday.
It was all else to know.	Waxay ahayd mid kale oo dhan in la ogaado.
As they are today.	Sida ay maanta yihiin.
I will definitely do another one soon.	Waa hubaal inaan samayn doono mid kale dhawaan.
Not really at home.	Ma aha runtii guriga.
I told him not to come again.	Waxaan u sheegay in aanay mar dambe iman.
Now and then I came back.	Hadda iyo ka dib waan soo noqday.
In fact, no one.	Dhab ahaantii, qofna ma jiro.
Maybe she does what she wants.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sameyso waxay rabto.
It's hard, but it will get better.	Way adag tahay, laakiin way fiicnaan doontaa.
This is right friend.	Tani waa sax saaxiib.
Everything would help.	Wax kasta ayaa ku caawin lahaa.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I wanted to.	Waxaan rabay inaan rabo.
No one knew exactly.	Qofna si sax ah uma ogeyn.
Very good idea too.	Fikrad aad u wanaagsan sidoo kale.
He did nothing.	Waxba ma samayn.
This can be difficult by accident.	Tani waxay dhib ku noqon kartaa wax iska yimid.
It is too early.	Waa wakhti hore.
But that is not for me.	Laakiin taasi aniga maaha.
I will help	Waan caawin doonaa
I don't know what will happen now.	Ma garanayo waxa hadda dhici doona.
It was not a problem.	Dhib ma ahayn.
But how can this be.	Laakiin sidee tani noqon kartaa.
You believe in him, you love him.	Waad rumaysan tahay isaga, waad jeceshahay isaga.
Sorry, I lost it there.	Waan ka xumahay, halkaas ayaan ku waayay.
He did not understand.	Ma uusan fahmin.
But someone else.	Laakiin qof kale.
It's very interesting.	Waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
You can't get more than this.	Ma heli kartid wax ka badan tan.
It was more than a problem.	Waxay ahayd wax ka badan dhib.
Certainly not.	Waxa hubaal ah in aanay ahayn.
But it is not coming.	Laakiin maaha soo socda.
That was real wisdom.	Taasi waxay ahayd caqli dhab ah.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
You need the following	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax soo socda
And once more.	Iyo hal mar oo kale.
Now it is not like that.	Hadda wax sidaas oo kale maaha.
I think that's enough now.	Waxaan filayaa inay ku filan tahay hadda.
Me and you, as you said.	Aniga iyo adiga, sida aad sheegtay.
Good for us.	Wanaagsan noo.
You can help with that, too.	Waad ku caawin kartaa taas, sidoo kale.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
You can't stay here	Halkan ma joogi kartid
Not at all.	La maaha .
That may have been.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay ahayd.
But she refused.	Laakiin way diiday.
That was so far.	Taasi waxay ahayd ilaa hadda.
I was unable to do so.	Ma awoodin in aan sameeyo.
.	.
This was very interesting.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Probably not much.	Malaha waxyaabo badan.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
No one here.	Ma jiro qof halkan.
Much to be done in very little time.	Wax badan oo la rabo in lagu sameeyo waqti aad u yar.
Now let's talk to him.	Hadda aan la hadlo isaga.
Much more needs to be done.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa loo baahan yahay in la sameeyo.
That was true, it was true.	Taas oo run ahayd, run ahayd.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
It is not very difficult.	Ma aha mid aad u adag.
I will not allow it	Ma ogolaan doono
You are an adult.	Qof weyn baad tahay.
Hardly anyone came out.	Si dhib leh qof ayaa soo baxay.
Maybe you do the same.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sameyso wax la mid ah.
I have to be.	Waa inaan noqon.
Now, there is only a little to talk about.	Hadda, waxaa jira in yar oo kaliya in laga hadlo.
I don't have one I like	Ma haysto mid aan jeclahay
He told me that this was so and so.	Wuxuu ii sheegay in tani ay tahay sidaas oo ay ahayd.
She did not come.	Ma aysan iman.
Why not be everything.	Waa maxay sababta aysan u noqon wax walba.
I am a happy man.	Waxaan ahay nin faraxsan.
It really doesn’t look good.	Dhab ahaantii uma eka mid wanaagsan.
Very well done.	Si aad u wanaagsan loo sameeyay.
I didn't want her to be there.	Maan rabin in ay halkaas joogto.
That they are not ready.	In aanay diyaar u ahayn.
It was not like now.	Ma ahayn sida hadda.
I can't go to work.	Ma aadi karo shaqada.
If he did, he left.	Haddii uu sameeyay, wuu ka baxay.
I said nothing else.	Wax kale ma odhan.
I will win	waan guulaysan doonaa
he was surprised.	wuu yaabay.
He just needs you.	Kaliya wuu kuu baahan yahay.
I have no idea what it is.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay.
We will do it	Waanu samayn doonaa
I will take him.	waan qaadan doonaa isaga.
I tried it here	Waxaan isku dayay halkan
But you also need to do other things.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxaad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso waxyaabo kale.
I think we will see.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inaan arki doono.
What's in it.	Maxaa ku jira.
I wanted to tell you.	Waxaan rabay inaan kuu sheego.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
And without paying.	Oo aan lacag ku bixin.
I do bad things for money.	Waxaan wax xun u sameeyaa lacag.
Nothing to see.	Ma jiraan wax la arko.
He looked beautiful.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid qurux badan.
It can do a lot.	Waxay sameyn kartaa wax badan.
I had no idea how to do it right.	Maan lahayn wax fikrad ah sida loo sameeyo si sax ah.
It is again.	Waa mar kale.
A lot of surprises.	Wax badan ayaa yaab leh.
I like	waan jeclahay
All I need right now is.	Waxa kaliya ee aan hadda u baahanahay waa .
That is not a lie.	Taasi been maaha.
It looks amazing.	Waxay u egtahay wax la yaab leh.
He decided to lie.	Wuxuu go'aansaday inuu been sheego.
That remains to be seen.	Taas ayaa weli ah in la ogaado.
This was all known.	Tani waxay ahayd dhammaan la yaqaan.
He did not return.	Ma uu soo noqon.
He would love to talk.	Wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu hadlo.
You can help me.	Waad i caawin kartaa.
I had to earn some money to help someone.	Waxay ahayd inaan helo xoogaa lacag ah si aan qof u caawiyo.
I know it's not him.	Waan ogahay in aanu isaga ahayn.
This can actually be bad.	Tani dhab ahaantii waxay noqon kartaa mid xun.
Took and took and took.	Qaaday oo qaatay oo qaatay.
You're good !.	Waa ku fiican tahay!.
But so far so good.	Laakiin ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan.
He was a nice, nice guy.	Wuxuu ahaa nin fiican oo fiican.
I hope to see you again, soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan mar kale ku arko, dhawaan.
Does it look good.	Miyuu u muuqdaa mid wanaagsan.
I told you this would happen.	Waxaan kuu sheegay in tani dhici doonto.
Nothing can ever.	Wax waligiis ma awoodo.
I think I can't do it.	Waxay ila tahay inaanan sameyn karin.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
He didn't like it very much.	Aad uma uu jeclayn.
I can't imagine why anyone would talk to me.	Ma u malayn karo sababta qof ii la hadli doono.
You can't take it back.	Dib uma qaadan kartid.
It can't happen otherwise.	Si kale uma dhici karto.
That being said.	Sidaas ayaa lagu yiri.
I just don't know how.	Kaliya ma garanayo sida.
The more you do, the more fun it becomes.	Inta badan oo aad sameyso, ayaa aad u sii xiiso badan.
You really can't see it anymore.	Runtii mar dambe ma arki kartid.
That, and a few.	Taasi, iyo dhowr.
I know you don't like that.	Waan ogahay inaadan jeclayn taas.
You can't even see the people from here.	Xitaa ma arki kartid dadka halkan ka yimid.
I love everything he did.	Waan jeclahay wax kasta oo uu sameeyay.
I would love to do it again.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mar kale sameeyo.
It can be.	Wuxuu noqon karaa .
They will help us.	Way na caawin doonaan.
She was an old friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib hore.
Really, I really am.	Runtii, run ahaantii waan ahay.
It really was something.	Runtii wax bay ahayd.
He left yesterday.	Shalay ayuu tagay.
I will come up with something.	wax baan la iman doonaa.
I had a good time.	Waxaan soo qaatay waqti fiican.
As such.	Sida cad oo kale.
Please bring it	Fadlan soo qaado
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
She was a friend.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib.
But now enough.	Laakiin hadda ku filan.
It is no longer there.	Mar dambe ma joogto.
But it was not very interesting.	Laakiin ma ahayn mid aad u xiiso badan.
It can be a lot of money.	Waxay noqon kartaa lacag aad u badan.
Maybe, they do.	Malaha, way sameeyaan.
Very smart.	Aad u caqli badan.
To him.	Ilaa isaga .
But that would happen.	Laakiin taasi way dhici lahayd.
You will be loved.	Waa lagu jeclaan doonaa.
Tom couldn't get out.	Tom wuu ka bixi waayay.
I had to.	Waxay ahayd inaan .
You can't get it right.	Si sax ah uma heli kartid.
I just got out of it.	Hadda ayaan ka soo baxay.
That's a lot of money.	Taasi waa lacag aad u badan.
I'm sorry again.	Waan ka xumahay mar kale.
I keep it at home for a while	Waxaan guriga ku hayaa xoogaa
That is a beautiful idea.	Taasi waa fikrad qurux badan.
I will give you time	waqti ayaan ku siin doonaa
It was hard there.	Waxay ahayd wax adag oo halkaas ka jira.
He said he loved it.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu jecel yahay.
Good day to you.	Maalin wanaagsan adiga.
Doing the right thing.	Samaynta wax sax ah.
This was a little better.	Tani waxay ahayd wax yar ka wanaagsan.
But it is something you should know.	Laakiin waa wax ay tahay inaad ogaato.
That is enough.	Taasi waa ku filan tahay.
I love to learn	Waxaan jeclahay inaan barto
I can say something wrong.	Waxaan sheegi karaa wax aan sax ahayn.
Don’t get it all too soon.	Ha u helin dhammaan si degdeg ah.
All there, he saw.	Halkaas oo dhan, wuu arkay.
I was very smart.	Waxaan ahaa mid aad u caqli badan.
Don't leave me.	Ha iga tagin.
I have no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma qabo.
He said he thought it would be great for me.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu u maleeyay in ay wax weyn ii noqon doonto.
Now he heard.	Hadda wuu maqlay.
I hope so too.	Waxaan rajeynayaa sidoo kale.
That's what he did, after all.	Taasi waa waxa uu sameeyay, ka dib oo dhan.
This is not always the case.	Had iyo jeer sidaas maaha.
How amazing, he thought.	Sidee aad u yaab badan, ayuu u maleeyay.
Also.	Sidoo kale.
I can't say what will happen.	Ma sheegi karo waxa dhici doona.
It's something I can't feed myself.	Waa wax aan cunto i siin karin.
But she doesn't want to tell me.	Laakiin ma rabto inay ii sheegto.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
He was, you know.	Wuxuu ahaa, waad ogtahay.
Most will stay.	Inta badan way joogi doonaan.
He saw it as strange.	Wuxuu u arkay wax yaab leh.
That seems to me.	Taasi waxay ila tahay aniga.
Any chance? 	Fursad kasta?
.	.
But she did not want to do that to him.	Laakiin ma ay rabin in ay sidaas ku samayso isaga.
I'm not sure about that.	Ma hubo arrintan.
She has lost a lot.	Wax badan way wayday.
Otherwise, I do not know what to do.	Haddii kale, ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
I couldn’t imagine what he would do.	Ma malayn karin waxa uu samayn doono.
Both are very complex.	Labaduba aad bay u adag yihiin.
Also very fast.	Sidoo kale aad u degdeg badan.
I was for all.	Waxaan u ahaa dhammaan.
No wonder.	Wax la yaab leh maaha.
It is the same.	Waa mid isku mid ah.
I think so.	Waxaan u maleynayaa sidaas.
Anyone can take it.	Qof kastaa wuu qaadan karaa.
I will give that.	taas ayaan siin doonaa.
He knows what he is doing.	Waxa uu sameeyo wuu garanayaa.
He would have time to learn.	Wuxuu heli lahaa waqti uu ku barto.
Much less.	Wax badan ayaa ka yar.
Not if you know what you are doing.	Ma aha haddii aad ogtahay waxaad samaynayso.
That is not the case.	Taasi maaha.
We were just.	Waxaan ahayn kaliya.
This was a little different.	Tani waxay ahayd wax yar oo kale.
He really didn't want to talk about it now.	Runtii ma uusan rabin inuu hadda ka hadlo arrintan.
I don’t feel it right now.	Anigu ma dareemayo hadda.
I have to look my best.	Waa inaan u muuqdaa sida ugu fiican.
But that was not true.	Laakiin taasi sax ma ahayn.
Everyone was there.	Qof kastaa wuu wada joogay.
Maybe there is something you can do about it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax aad ka qaban karto taas.
I want to surprise him.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la yaabo isaga.
This was recently.	Tani waxay ahayd dhawaan.
Well done again.	Si wanaagsan ayaa mar kale loo sameeyay.
It's an interesting place.	Waa meel xiiso leh.
I wish he was here.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu halkan joogo.
That was the only time it was mentioned.	Taasi waxay ahayd markii kaliya ee la sheegay.
You will see, you will see.	Waad arki doontaa, waad arki doontaa.
But after nothing.	Laakiin waxba ka dib.
She said she would like to go.	Waxay sheegtay inay jeclaan lahayd inay aado.
Everything that will happen will happen.	Wax kasta oo dhici doona ayaa dhici doona.
He may not want me to leave.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan rabin inaan baxo.
He was just amazing.	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya yaab.
You know, he's still in it.	Waad ogtahay, inuu weli ku jiro.
But he had other things to do.	Laakiin wuxuu lahaa waxyaabo kale oo uu sameeyo.
But, he did not do this.	Laakiin, tan ma uu samayn.
Very beautiful, really.	Aad u qurux badan, runtii.
No one knows why.	Qofna ma garanayo sababta.
He liked it.	Wuu ka helay.
She said she didn't want him.	Waxay sheegtay in aanay rabin isaga.
Give three more.	Saddex kale sii.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I didn’t get it at first.	Maan helin markii hore.
This is not seen.	Tan lama arko.
I want to be	Waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo
Maybe the same, but not the same.	Laga yaabaa in la mid ah, laakiin ma aha isku mid.
But, first of all.	Laakiin, marka hore wax walba.
That is now.	Taasi waa hadda.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
I have to know what she said yesterday.	Waa inaan ogaado waxay shalay u sheegtay.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
He was one of them.	Wuxuu ka mid ahaa.
It was what she did.	Waxay ahayd waxa ay samaysay.
But they are also very small.	Laakiin sidoo kale aad bay u yar yihiin.
Take something else.	Wax kale qaado.
I wonder if, for me, this is too big.	Waxaan la yaabanahay haddii, aniga ahaan, tani ay aad u weyn tahay.
It was as it were.	Waxay ahayd sida ay tahay.
It wasn't much.	Wax badan ma ahayn.
But I need it.	Laakiin waxaan u baahanahay.
After all, you did, once.	Ka dib oo dhan, waxaad samaysay, hal mar.
Nothing so far.	Wax ilaa hadda ma jiraan.
But really, he did not say why.	Laakiin run ahaantii, ma uu odhan sababta.
Ah I will deal with that.	Ah waan ka qaban doonaa taas.
He just said he couldn't do it.	Kaliya wuxuu sheegay inuusan sameyn karin.
I am one of them.	Waxaan ka mid ahay.
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeceshahay.
There’s been a lot of time before we met, you know.	Waxaa jira waqti aad u badan ka hor inta aan nala helin, waad ogtahay.
Give us time.	Waqti na sii.
I found something else to do.	Waxaan helay wax kale oo aan sameeyo.
It's not fun.	Ma aha wax xiiso leh.
You will tell me why.	Waxaad ii sheegi doontaa sababta.
He entered.	Wuu galay.
Making it better than it really was, he thought.	Isaga oo ka dhigay mid ka fiican sidii uu runtii ahaa, ayuu mooday.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
Both are one now.	Labaduba hal baa jira hadda.
That should be more than enough for one day.	Taasi waa in ka badan ku filan hal maalin.
What's going on here? 	Maxaa halkan ka socda?
I was really surprised why.	Runtii aad ayaan u yaabay sababta.
I think that's it.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay.
They always do this.	Had iyo jeer waxay sameeyaan tan.
You can talk about it.	Waad ka hadli kartaa.
Still, it was not surprising.	Weli, ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I saw him.	Waan arkay isaga.
That can take time.	Taasi waxay qaadan kartaa waqti.
I love everyone.	Waan jeclahay qof walba.
But it is difficult to say.	Laakiin way adag tahay in la sheego.
Anyone can see it.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa.
I could not.	Waan awoodi waayay.
Nothing to see here.	Ma jiraan wax halkan lagu arko.
You are a beautiful man.	Nin qurux badan baad tahay.
It is unbelievable.	Waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
She was unbelievable.	Waxay ahayd qof aan la rumaysan karin.
Like today.	Maanta oo kale.
He is nowhere to be found.	Meel uu joogo ma joogo.
You will see nearby.	Waxaad arki doontaa meel dhow.
We are glad that you are ready to help us.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad diyaar u tahay inaad na caawiso.
There is another who seemed to really want the job.	Waxaa jira mid kale oo u muuqday inuu runtii doonayo shaqada.
I will definitely stay again.	Waa hubaal inaan mar kale sii joogi doono.
Something happened to him.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
I don’t understand why, really.	Ma fahmin sababta, runtii.
It is not harder than that.	Ma aha mid ka sii adag taas.
It was amazing to see.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh in la arko.
It hasn't been around really long.	Muddo dheer ma joogin runtii.
It can be done differently, but it is not.	Waa la samayn karaa si kale, laakiin maaha.
I have never done it before.	Weligay ma samayn ka hor.
She did not come.	Ma ay iman.
Something very bad.	Wax aad u xun .
Really no one is sure.	Run ahaantii qofna ma hubo.
It was the same.	Waxay ahayd isku mid.
You can find new things to do all the time.	Waxaad heli kartaa waxyaabo cusub oo aad sameyso mar kasta.
But it can't be helped.	Laakiin lama caawin karo.
It is still a beautiful day.	Wali waa maalin qurux badan.
Nor can I.	Sidoo kale ma awoodo.
I say.	waxaan leeyahay .
Quickly today.	Si degdeg ah maanta.
I see, it's a little while ago.	Aan arko, waa wax yar ka hor.
People were robbed.	Dadka ayaa la dhacay.
But here.	Laakiin halkan.
I think that's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiican tahay.
I had to.	Waxay ahayd inaan awoodo.
I hope it was.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay ahayd.
He said a little.	Wax yar buu yidhi.
Otherwise, it probably won’t be.	Haddii kale, waxay u badan tahay inaysan ahaan doonin.
Don't say.	Ha odhan.
I was surprised.	waan kula yaabay.
He looks in good spirits.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid niyad wanaagsan.
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu eegay.
He doesn't have to talk to me.	Ma aha inuu ila hadlo.
He left.	Wuu ka tagay.
I have never spoken openly before.	Weligay si cad hore uma hadlin.
All very nice people.	Dhammaan dadka aad u fiican.
In fact, it is very bad.	Dhab ahaantii, aad bay u xun tahay.
We would definitely be here again.	Waa hubaal inaan halkan mar kale joogi lahayn.
There must be more.	Waa inay jiraan wax badan.
Everything was done correctly.	Wax walba si sax ah ayaa loo sameeyay.
But it would also be nice.	Laakiin sidoo kale way fiicnaan lahayd.
That seemed a long time ago.	Wixii u muuqday wakhti aad u dheer.
I would like to do something about that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax ka sameeyo taas.
She lost everything.	Wax walba way wayday.
And other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale.
Take it somewhere else.	Meel kale u qaado.
That is what you want me to do.	Taasi waa waxa aad rabto inaan sameeyo.
What a day, what a day.	Maxaa maalin ah, maxaa maalin ah.
Until you are serious.	Ilaa aad ka dhab tahay.
That is the whole reason.	Taasi waa sababta oo dhan.
There was nothing else anyone could do for me.	Wax kale oo qof igu samayn karo ma jirin.
But here there is no such thing.	Laakiin halkan ma jiraan wax la mid ah.
It wasn’t too much.	Ma ahayn mid aad u badan.
I really have to go	Runtii waa inaan tago
Something strange.	Wax la yaab leh.
I will always love you.	Had iyo jeer waan ku jeclaan doonaa.
Maybe today was a lucky day.	Malaha maanta waxay ahayd maalin nasiib badan.
She didn't get it.	Ma aysan helin.
Not all have succeeded.	Ma wada guulaysan.
And it was very interesting again.	Oo waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan mar kale.
This is also true for me.	Tani sidoo kale waa run aniga.
No one seems to be at home.	Qofna uma eka inuu guriga joogo.
That was just that.	Taasi waxay ahayd kaliya.
But there is more.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan.
Probably the only one.	Malaha ka kaliya.
She had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inay samayso.
You can't stop this.	Ma joojin kartid tan.
I love what you do	Waan jeclahay waxaad sameyso
There is really something for everyone.	Run ahaantii qof walba wax baa u jira.
But he did more.	Laakiin wax ka badan ayuu sameeyay.
Enough now.	Ku filan hadda.
In fact, it was very close.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
That usually does.	Taasi inta badan way sameyso.
It will not do that.	Taas ma yeeli doono.
I had a lot to say.	Waxaan lahaa wax badan oo aan sheego.
She had to stay for him.	Waxay ahayd inuu u joogo isaga.
He wanted to learn more.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax badan barto.
He had no idea who she was.	Wax fikrad ah kama uusan lahayn cidda ay tahay.
I just would love to	Kaliya waan jeclaan lahaa
There was nothing.	Waxba kuma jirin.
I really wanted to eat.	Runtii waxaan rabay inaan cuno.
Not as exciting.	Ma aha sida xiiso leh.
How I see things.	Sida aan wax u arko.
But that is enough now.	Laakiin taas hadda waa ku filan tahay.
Not again.	Ma aha mar kale.
They are very small	Aad bay u yar yihiin
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I know you will do this for us.	Waan ogahay inaad tan noo samayn doonto.
Today I lost a friend.	Maanta waxaan waayay saaxiib.
He could not leave.	Waa uu ka bixi waayay.
For most of me, it was something new.	Inta badan aniga oo kale, waxay ahayd wax cusub.
He made her want to.	Wuxuu ka dhigay inay rabto.
Maybe I should stay a little longer.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax yar joogo.
But he is mostly happy.	Laakiin inta badan wuu faraxsan yahay.
It can be very interesting.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
They may not think so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan u malaynayn.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay.
But he did not want to do it.	Laakiin ma uu doonayn inuu sameeyo.
But close friends.	Laakiin saaxiibo dhow.
There was nothing new.	Ma jirin wax cusub oo kaliya.
Nothing else, now.	Wax kale ma jiraan, hadda.
That's exactly what you want.	Waa sax waxaad rabto.
It was not difficult.	Ma ahayn mid adag.
I started immediately.	Si degdeg ah ayaan u bilaabay.
There was none.	Ma jirin.
It is difficult but it will happen.	Way adag tahay laakiin way dhici doontaa.
I'll be back.	Dib ayaan ugu soo noqon doonaa.
I was a little cute.	Waxaan ahaa mid yar oo qurux badan.
It was beautiful.	Wax qurux badan bay ahayd.
It is actually smaller now.	Dhab ahaantii wuu ka yar yahay hadda.
It doesn't matter to me.	Waxba igama aha.
I am very happy indeed.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay runtii.
It was unknown.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la garanayn.
Also a small car.	Sidoo kale baabuur yar.
He did not come close.	Uma soo dhawaan.
She was a good person.	Waxay ahayd qof wanaagsan.
They will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doonaan.
I am a man without a car.	Waxaan ahay nin aan baabuur lahayn.
I had a very bad time.	Waxaan helay waqti aad u xun.
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado.
It’s just money after all.	Waa lacag kaliya ka dib dhan.
I knew it would be.	Waan ogaa inay noqon doonto.
It really doesn't work.	Runtii ma shaqeeyo.
Just too much.	Kaliya aad u badan.
That is the other way around.	Taasi waa tan kale.
I have to be here now.	Waa inaan hadda halkan joogo.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
It would always be so.	Mar walba sidaas buu ahaan lahaa.
That is not what we need.	Taasi maaha waxa aan u baahanahay.
It seems to be untrue.	Waxay u egtahay inaysan run ahayn.
I am still not sure where that is.	Ilaa hadda ma hubo halka ay taasi tahay.
And good thing, too.	Iyo wax wanaagsan, sidoo kale.
I had something to do.	Waxaan lahaa wax aan sameeyo.
I'm sorry to see that.	Waan ka xumahay inaan taas arko.
He will see you coming.	Wuu arki doonaa adiga oo soo socda.
It is often non-existent.	Inta badan waa wax aan jirin.
He did it, no problem.	Wuu u sameeyay, dhib malaha.
That's what they had to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
I can stop	Waan joojin karaa
I could not see anyone.	Qofna maan arki karin.
I want to come out	Waxaan rabaa inaan soo baxo
That there is still time.	In weli waqti jiro.
A lot is going on.	Wax badan ayaa socda.
Great one.	Mid weyn.
Otherwise, they will not.	Haddii kale, ma yeeli doonaan.
Everyone looks beautiful.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa mid qurux badan.
Something still felt.	Wax weli la dareemay.
He had no idea about this.	Wax fikrad ah kama uu lahayn arrintan.
Still not sure.	Wali ma hubo.
Now this is something new.	Hadda tani waa wax cusub.
He wanted nothing more.	Wax kale ma uu rabin.
This is not a problem.	Tani dhib malaha.
They are too many.	Aad bay u badan yihiin.
There is no other way.	Si kale oo loo sheego ma jirto.
Stop, stop.	Jooji, jooji.
Like everyone else.	Sida dadka kale oo dhan.
It will only take a little time.	Kaliya qaadan doona waqti yar.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
That is something other than you.	Taasi waa wax aan adiga ahayn.
I'm sure we don't all understand.	Waxaan hubaa inaanan wada fahmin.
here it is known	halkan waa lagu yaqaan
This was very difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
It's hard to be different.	Way adag tahay inay si kale noqon karto.
But still the same problem.	Laakiin weli dhibaato isku mid ah.
She can still do the job.	Weli way qaban kartaa shaqada.
If you can help us, it is very good.	Haddii aad na caawin karto, aad bay u fiican tahay.
He seemed to know everyone.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu qof walba garanayo.
Now it is the same.	Hadda waa isku mid.
Not for everyone.	Ma aha qof walba.
This is definitely true.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa run.
That will come later.	Taas mar dambe ayaan iman doonaa.
He was not ready.	Diyaar uma ahayn.
He really is.	Runtii wuu yahay.
You will also have a much better time.	Waxaad sidoo kale heli doontaa waqti aad uga wanaagsan.
He would come here.	Wuu iman lahaa halkan.
I really am nothing.	Runtii waxba ma ihi.
Everything he told me was there.	Wax kasta oo uu ii sheegay ayaa ku jiray halkaas.
There were a lot of cars.	Waxaa jiray baabuur badan.
Once upon a time.	Hal mar .
So far it has not existed.	Ilaa hadda ma jirin.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
He is not a bad person.	Ma ahan qof xun.
She didn't want me to talk about it.	Ma ay rabin in aan ka hadlo.
You, the others.	Adiga, dadka kale.
But I do that.	Laakiin taas waan sameeyaa.
This is how I like it.	Tani waa sida aan jeclahay.
I can tell him anything he doesn’t know.	Waxaan u sheegi karaa wax kasta oo uusan garanayn.
I want to know what he knows.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wuxuu yaqaan.
Great one, too.	Mid weyn, sidoo kale.
It was bad.	Waxay ahayd mid xun.
In the same way if you have done something good.	Si la mid ah haddii aad samaysay wax fiican.
She can't get any money.	Wax lacag ah ma heli karto.
Maybe it still is.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay weli tahay.
He became a very good man.	Waxa uu noqday nin aad u fiican.
This was unnecessary.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aan loo baahnayn.
There are other things to do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale oo la sameeyo.
There was nothing false.	Ma jirin wax been ah.
This she did.	Tani way samaysay.
Please let me know	Fadlan ii soo sheeg
You did something very good.	Waxaad samaysay wax aad u wanaagsan.
He wanted me to do better than him.	Wuxuu rabay inaan sameeyo wax ka wanaagsan isaga.
I have to do it.	Waa inaan sameeyaa.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
That can't be.	Taasi ma noqon karto.
He had little to say.	Waxa uu lahaa wax yar oo uu sheego.
Why is it the way it is.	Waa maxay sababta ay tahay sida ay tahay.
It is better to do something with it.	Waxaa fiican inaad wax ku samayso.
I don't know anything, right now.	Waxba ma garanayo, hadda.
How difficult that is.	Sidee bay taasi u adag tahay.
It would be better than nothing.	Way ka fiicnaan lahayd waxba.
He is a great friend of mine.	Waa saaxiib weyn oo aan leeyahay.
I'm really scared, you know.	Runtii waan baqayaa, waad ogtahay.
Me and you, again.	Aniga iyo adiga, mar kale.
He is a bad man.	Waa nin xun.
Everyone is there.	Qof kastaa wuu joogaa.
I hope this will help.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ku caawin doonto.
I tried it, you know.	Waan isku dayay, waad ogtahay.
Obviously they did not get it.	Sida iska cad ma aysan helin.
Maybe after all it was the same.	Malaha ka dib oo dhan waxay ahayd isku mid.
That was the only thing she did.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee ay samaysay.
Once, any time, there is no time.	Mar, wakhti kasta, wakhti ma jiro.
It's a little bigger, but it's definitely more beautiful.	Way ka yara weyn tahay, laakiin hubaal way qurux badan tahay.
There was not much to see.	Wax badan oo la arki lahaa ma jirin.
To work every day.	Maalin kasta in la shaqeeyo.
He was not a bad man.	Ma ahayn nin xun.
He saw everything.	Wax walba wuu arkay.
Debt, too.	Lacag lagu leeyahay, sidoo kale.
I do a lot.	Wax badan ayaan sameeyaa.
Which is probably true.	Taas oo malaha run tahay.
Maybe he can help.	Malaha wuu ku caawin karaa.
This is no small feat.	Tani ma aha wax yar.
The same was not true.	Isla sidaas oo kale run kama ahayn.
.	.
This was amazing.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la yaab leh.
To find out where you are.	Si aad u ogaato meesha aad joogto.
But I found something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaan helay.
Only someone to be present.	Kaliya qof inuu joogo.
It will be that it is not.	Waxay noqon doontaa in aanay ahayn.
I couldn’t say better.	Ma aan odhan karin si ka wanaagsan.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
At first he refused.	Marka hore wuu diiday.
You look like someone else.	Waxaad u egtahay qof kale.
I am here now	hadda waan joogaa
I am happy to help.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan caawiyo.
It would really happen.	Runtii way dhici lahayd.
He wants to be here and now.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu halkan iyo hadda joogo.
Everyone wondered what he would say.	Qof kastaa waxa uu la yaabay waxa uu odhan doono.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
A lot is true.	Wax badan ayaa run ah.
I want to be here and now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan halkan iyo hadda joogo.
Who knows.	Nin yaa yaqaan.
I'm sure they will be fine.	Waan hubaa inay fiicnaan doonaan.
He told this to several people.	Dhowr qof ayuu u sheegay tan.
Beautiful things.	Waxyaabo qurux badan.
You can do it anytime.	Waad samayn kartaa wakhti kasta.
I will never do that to you.	Weligay sidaas kugu samayn maayo.
There is no time.	Waqti ma jiro.
I know.	Anigu waan ogahay.
He loves you so much.	Aad buu kuu jecel yahay.
You can get it.	Waad heli kartaa.
This may not always be true.	Tani waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan run ahayn mar walba.
It is obvious.	Waa wax iska cad.
And it is not an opportunity, it is certainly not an opportunity.	Oo maaha fursad, hubaal maaha fursad.
it does nothing.	waxba ma sameeyo.
Anyone can see it.	Qof kastaa wuu arki karaa.
He thinks he is small, but he is not.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inuu yar yahay, laakiin maaha.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
He knew what he wanted to do, too.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu doonayo inuu sameeyo, sidoo kale.
That is something I am not interested in.	Taasi waa wax aan xiiso ii lahayn.
That is indeed true.	Runtii taasi waa run.
She really loves you.	Runtii way ku jeceshahay.
I couldn't help it	Waan caawin waayay
He looked very happy.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u faraxsan.
It was a little off for him.	Wax yar bay isaga ku ahayd.
They really do.	Dhab ahaantii way sameeyaan.
I just didn’t know how.	Kaliya maan garanayn sida.
But they did not get it all.	Laakiin ma aysan wada helin.
But he was not given a chance.	Laakiin wax fursad ah lama siin.
He clearly refused to do so.	Wuxuu si cad u diiday inuu sidaas sameeyo.
The first will come to you.	Ka hore ayaa kuu iman doona.
Everything that will happen will also get better.	Wax kasta oo dhici doona ayaa sidoo kale fiicnaan doona.
Then we will see what is best to do.	Ka dib waxaan arki doonaa waxa ugu fiican in la sameeyo.
It will take some time to find out.	Waxay qaadan doontaa xoogaa waqti ah in wax la ogaado.
That is new.	Taasi waa mid cusub.
Would you believe how much.	Ma aad rumaysan lahayd inta.
There was no door.	Albaabka ma jirin.
This was not me.	Tani aniga ma ahayn.
But that was later.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd markii dambe.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
He will take this every time he leaves the house.	Tan wuu qaadan doonaa mar kasta oo uu guriga ka baxo.
It was so much fun and so much fun.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan oo aad u xiiso badan.
But something is not right.	Laakiin wax aan sax ahayn.
I wish I had no one.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan qofna haysto.
No one knows the prison.	Qofna ma garanayo xabsiga.
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
Only once, but it is enough.	Kaliya hal mar, laakiin way ku filan tahay.
But otherwise, he did not know.	Laakiin si kale, ma uu ogayn.
This is what they will say to me.	Tani waa waxa ay iga odhan doonaan.
But that’s right, too.	Laakiin taasi waa sax, sidoo kale.
It could be better for me.	Way iga fiicnaan kartaa aniga.
And someone will say something.	Oo qof baa wax odhan doona.
That is nothing new.	Taasi wax cusub maaha.
What is it?.	Waa maxay?.
They are very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan yihiin.
I do not want to leave here clearly.	Ma rabo inaan halkan si cad uga tago.
I never came out.	Weligay maan soo bixin.
No one has seen anything like it.	Qofna ma arag wax la mid ah.
Hard work.	Shaqo adag.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani run maaha.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
I still want to work hard.	Weli waxaan rabaa inaan si adag u shaqeeyo.
If you want enough.	Haddii aad rabto in kugu filan.
It would be hard to be otherwise.	Way adag tahay inay si kale ahaan lahayd.
I can help you with what you really need.	Waxaan kaa caawin karaa waxaad dhab ahaantii u baahan tahay.
No one found him.	Qofna ma helin isaga.
Something else is non-existent.	Wax kale waa wax aan jirin.
I know you did.	Waan ogahay inaad samaysay.
He understood nothing.	Waxba ma uu fahmin.
It looks interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid xiiso leh.
Tell them this.	U sheeg tan.
It is here, here	Waa halkan, halkan
But it is not real.	Laakiin dhab maaha.
You can do it now.	Waxaad samayn kartaa hadda.
I will get it soon.	Waan heli doonaa dhawaan.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
That is a problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato.
I will not get it.	Ma heli doono.
It was too early.	Waxay ahayd goor hore.
You didn't lie.	Been sheegi wayday.
And very beautiful indeed.	Iyo mid aad u qurux badan runtii.
He doesn't want to leave now.	Ma rabto inuu hadda baxo.
Everyone knew something.	Qof kastaa wax buu ogaa.
You do not need help	Ma aadan u baahnayn caawin
It is nothing new.	Wax cusub maaha.
It really was a tough day.	Runtii waxay ahayd maalin adag.
You may be right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sax tahay.
It looks like it really is.	Waxay u egtahay inay dhab ahaantii tahay.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
There is no problem.	Ma jiraan wax dhib ah.
A new problem.	Dhibaato cusub.
He wanted nothing more.	Wax kale ma uusan rabin.
I found myself again '.	Mar kale ayaan is helay'.
You can't come here.	Halkan kama iman kartid.
They should also make money.	Waa inay sidoo kale lacag sameeyaan.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
It will always be that way.	Way sii ahaan doontaa sidaas.
You did after all.	Waad samaysay ka dib oo dhan.
he couldn't take it, really.	wuu qaadan waayay, runtii.
But it is enough for me.	Laakiin wuu igu filan yahay.
But it is so.	Laakiin waa sidaas.
The rest.	Inta kale .
It is really very simple.	Runtii aad ayuu u dhib yar yahay.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
I don't think you can do anything else.	Uma maleynayo inaad wax kale sameyn karto.
Now there was no urgency.	Hadda wax degdeg ah ma jirin.
This was really true.	Tani dhab ahaantii run bay ahayd.
It's all at once.	Waa wax walba isku mar.
Something I take.	Wax aan qaado.
Obviously, this is a very bad idea.	Sida iska cad, tani waa fikrad aad u xun.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga.
But not you.	Laakiin adiga maaha.
Pick up a man.	Nin soo qaado.
Each one.	Mid kasta .
That’s all I know.	Taasi waa waxa aan ogahay oo dhan.
I wondered it would hurt.	Waxaan la yaabay inay wax yeeli doonto.
That may be the only thing.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa waxa kaliya.
I really have no idea.	Run ahaantii wax fikrad ah kama haysto.
.	.
Maybe that's why you're here.	Malaha waa sababta aad halkan u joogto.
I may need it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan u baahanahay.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
What a false problem.	Maxaa dhib been ah.
It was no small feat.	Wax yar ma ahayn.
I have to do it	Waa inaan sameeyaa
You may not do so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan sidaas samayn.
That he has always been.	In uu mar walba ahaa.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I was unlucky.	Nasiib ma lahayn.
He was everywhere he needed to be.	Waxa uu ahaa meel kasta oo uu u baahan yahay.
I heard that.	Waxaan maqlay taas.
To this day I think so.	Ilaa maanta taas ayaan qabaa.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
I'm really sure.	Runtii waan hubaa.
And a little money.	Iyo lacag yar.
It was good, very good.	Waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan, aad u wanaagsan.
I am really happy to see you.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
Not every day.	Ma aha maalin kasta.
It was here, too.	Waxay ahayd halkan, sidoo kale.
And she did not want him to know.	Oo ma ay rabin inuu ogaado.
Maybe not.	Malaha malaha.
I wish we could do more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan qaban karno.
It was also right.	Sidoo kale sax bay ahayd.
This is, this and that.	Tani waa, taas iyo sidaas.
He will do it tomorrow.	Berri ayuu yeeli doonaa.
Certainly someone knew about this.	Waxaa hubaal ah in qof uu arrintan wax ka ogaa.
I tried again and again and again and again and again.	Waxaan isku dayay mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale iyo mar kale.
You said you would.	Waxaad sheegtay in aad sameyn doonto.
Nothing we do.	Wax aanu samayn.
Very, very beautiful.	Aad, aad u qurux badan.
That is not surprising.	Taasi la yaab maaha.
It is not available.	Lama hayo.
It is not a big lie.	Been weyn maaha.
This is a surprisingly difficult problem.	Tani waa dhibaato la yaab leh oo adag.
This should not be surprising.	Tani waa inaysan noqon wax la yaab leh.
No one feels anything.	Qofna waxba uma dareemayo.
Tell them that.	U sheeg taas.
He always did the right thing.	Mar walba wuxuu samayn jiray wax sax ah.
That's right.	Runtii waa sax.
That can be really great.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa runtii weyn.
He will say something.	Wax buu odhan doonaa.
Let it be there.	Halkaas ha joogto.
It can really go away.	Runtii way bixi kartaa.
We need someone like that to come here.	Waxaan u baahanahay qof sidaas oo kale ah inuu halkan yimaado.
It really is.	Dhab ahaantii waa.
We love it !.	Waanu jeclayn!.
He would say.	Wuu odhan lahaa.
I think that will be good.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi fiicnaan doonto.
No one speaks.	Qofna ma hadlo.
I want to talk to him now.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la hadlo hadda.
Maybe I have	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan haysto
It was not what had happened before.	Ma ahayn waxa hore u dhacay.
It was obvious.	Waxay ahayd wax iska cad.
He just loves it.	Kaliya wuu jecel yahay.
In fact, it will be very difficult.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u adag.
I didn't want to be there.	Maan rabin inaan halkaas joogo.
I think that's it.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay taasi tahay.
That is probably the best thing.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay tahay waxa ugu fiican.
There are many things you can do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo aad ku samayn karto.
I need things.	Waxaan u baahanahay waxyaabo.
I'm back now.	Hadda ayaan soo noqday.
I do that every day.	Taas ayaan sameeyaa maalin kasta.
She seems to always want to eat.	Waxay u egtahay inay had iyo jeer rabto inay wax cunto.
You know, so.	Waad ogtahay, sidaas.
Maybe I should do this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan tan sameeyo.
Everyone started talking.	Qof kastaa wuxuu bilaabay inuu hadlo.
It looks good and fresh.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan oo cusub.
Several times.	Dhowr jeer.
I wondered what he would do with that.	Waxa aan la yaabay waxa uu samayn lahaa taas.
It is likely to happen.	Waxay u badan tahay inay dhici doonto.
He did not have to know anything.	Ma uu lahayn si uu wax u ogaado.
I felt at home with you.	Waxaan dareemay inaan guriga kula joogo.
I had to leave.	Waxay ahayd inaan ka baxo.
It has not been done yet.	Weli lama samayn.
She had no idea, but something.	Wax fikrad ah kama ay haysan, laakiin wax.
Very well done.	Si aad u wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
Maybe she really did.	Malaha runtii way samaysay.
Must see !.	Waa in la arko!.
I can talk about it there.	Waan ka hadli karaa halkaas.
He is there.	Halkaas ayuu joogaa.
What's nearby.	Maxaa u dhow.
They are not smart.	Ma caqli badan yihiin.
That ends today.	Taasi waxay ku egtahay maanta.
Not like you.	Adiga oo kale maaha.
But not here, not now.	Laakiin halkan maaha, hadda maaha.
They are good at it.	Way ku fiican yihiin.
I just started here.	Hadda ayaan halkan ka bilaabay.
That was bad.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xun.
And, after all, it’s not too bad.	Iyo, ka dib oo dhan, ma aha mid aad u xun.
After all, it was what was given.	Ka dib oo dhan, waxay ahayd waxa la siiyay.
You will go out with him.	Waad la bixi doontaa isaga.
One day, maybe.	Hal maalin, malaha.
I wouldn’t have had a better chance.	Ma heli lahaa fursad ka fiican.
She is beautiful.	Way qurux badan tahay.
This was fun.	Tani waxay ahayd wax xiiso leh.
I'm still sorry about that.	Weli waan ka xumahay taas.
Often the reason is unknown.	Inta badan sababta lama garanayo.
I don't have to tell you that.	Ma aha inaan taas kuu sheego.
Everyone thought he would be fine.	Qof kastaa wuxuu mooday inuu fiicnaan doono.
If you are older.	Haddii aad ka weyn tahay.
I think we can do it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan sameyn karno.
If he really was, that is it.	Haddii uu dhab ahaan lahaa, taasi waa.
This cannot be helped right now.	Tan hadda lama caawin karo.
That it will get better.	In ay fiicnaan doonto.
He came in.	Meesha ayuu soo galay.
That he left only one.	In uu hal kaliya ka tagay .
Very beautiful stuff.	Waxyaabo aad u qurux badan.
Please tell me	Fadlan ii sheeg
Something you may not know much about.	Wax laga yaabo inaadan wax badan ka ogeyn.
What is it .	Waa maxay .
But maybe that's the way it is.	Laakiin malaha taasi waa sidaas oo kale.
That is because it has.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah waxay leedahay.
Give me something.	Wax i sii.
He has to do it regularly.	Waa inuu si joogto ah u sameeyaa.
He is a bad man.	Waa nin xun.
Very difficult and very fast.	Aad u adag oo aad u degdeg badan.
This is here.	Tani waa halkaan.
It looks very small.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u yar.
It's amazing.	Waa wax yaab leh.
It did not come from me.	Aniga igama iman.
Someone less money, less intelligent, less everything.	Qof lacag yar, caqli yar, wax walba ka yar.
That's why he was surprised.	Waa sababta uu ula yaabay.
But it really was.	Laakiin runtii waxay ahayd.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u wanaagsan yahay.
No one here, he said.	Qofna halkan, ayuu yidhi.
No one should even see you.	Qofna xitaa ma aha inuu ku arko.
And how bad.	Iyo sida xun.
Now he knows you are there.	Hadda wuu ogyahay inaad halkaas joogto.
They still don't.	Wali ma sameeyaan.
I really wanted to.	Runtii waan rabay.
He said he would be back soon.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu dhawaan soo noqon doono.
I think it will take a long time.	Waxaan filayaa inay muddo dheer qaadan doonto.
I think they are very bad.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay aad u xun yihiin.
It won’t stop people from doing it.	Ma joojin doonto dadka inay sameeyaan.
It's better not to go there now.	Waxaa fiican inaanan hadda tagin halkaas.
Whatever you want.	Waxa aad doonto.
Even that is uncertain.	Xitaa taasi lama hubo.
There is no real money.	Lacag dhab ah ma jirto.
No one else wants it.	Qof kale ma doonayo.
I can't stay home	Guriga ma joogi karo
Still love you.	Wali ku jecel.
This was true.	Tani run bay ahayd.
Not so badly, not as he left.	Ma aha si xun, ma aha sidii uu uga tagay.
I would really like to say that.	Runtii aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa inaan taas sheego.
Only, here it is.	Kaliya, waa kan.
They may be difficult.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay adag yihiin.
That is everything.	Taas oo ah wax walba.
Still true for me, really.	Wali run aniga, dhab ahaantii.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doonto.
That is great for me.	Aniga taasi waa igu weyn tahay.
It is a good and right place.	Waa meel fiican oo sax ah.
That is, really.	Taasi waa, dhab ahaantii.
We didn’t have time to do that.	Ma aan haysan waqti aan taas ku samayno.
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa taas.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
That was, it happened.	Taasi waxay ahayd, wuu dhacay.
This was difficult.	Tani waxay ahayd mid adag.
I have no one here	Qofna kuma hayo halkan
I would go out.	waan la bixi lahaa.
No problem.	Dhib malaha.
It is always the same with you.	Had iyo jeer waa sidaas oo kale adiga.
I am very happy to have you here.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan kugu haysto.
He asked me to stay here.	Wuxuu iga codsaday inaan halkaan joogo.
I don't want to see you.	Ma rabo inaan ku arko.
He was not a very big person.	Ma ahayn qof aad u weyn.
It would help	Wuu caawin lahaa
She really did.	Runtii way samaysay.
I still have it somewhere.	Weli meel baan ku hayaa.
You know, it's hard for people here.	Waad ogtahay, way ku adag tahay dadka halkan.
I love that	Waan jeclahay sidaas
One day later it was very bad.	Hal maalin ka dib waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It looks so bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xun.
I had to find myself.	Waxay ahayd inaan is helo.
It looks good.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
It was not a good time.	Waqti fiican ma ahayn.
I know how bad that is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi u xun tahay.
That's beautiful.	Taasi qurux badan.
We will do it	Waanu qaban doonaa
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd mid la yaab leh.
I am not yet.	Ilaa hadda ma ihi.
Nothing found	Waxba lama helin
And maybe they are.	Oo laga yaabo inay yihiin.
That is true.	Taasi waa run.
I just have to.	Kaliya waa inaan.
Even when it really looks like one.	Xitaa marka ay runtii u egtahay mid.
She would let him have it.	Waxay u ogolaan lahayd inuu haysto.
I think it can really help people.	Waxaan filayaa inay runtii dadka caawin karto.
I didn’t get a chance to do it.	Maan helin fursad aan ku sameeyo.
Don't do it !.	Ha samayn!.
There is little for you.	Wax yar baa kuu jira.
Someone like him.	Qof isaga la mid ah.
He would stop you.	Wuu ku joojin lahaa.
He knew, and he did nothing.	Wuu ogaa, oo waxba ma uu samayn.
It was a good thing he did.	Waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan inuu sameeyay.
You will find this.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa tan.
If you can get it, you can't get it.	Haddii aad heli karto, kuma heli karto.
But he never succeeded.	Laakiin waligiis ma guulaysan.
This cannot be so.	Tani ma noqon karto sidaas.
It came out surprisingly.	Si la yaab leh ayuu u soo baxay.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.
He wanted me to have it all.	Waxa uu rabay in aan haysto oo dhan.
This is what it was.	Tani waa waxa ay ahayd.
And he looked so beautiful.	Oo wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u qurux badan.
That should be sufficient enough to keep me here.	Taasi waa igu filan inaan halkaan igu sii hayo.
The location will be announced later.	Meesha dib ayaa laga sheegi doonaa.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
I did nothing yesterday.	Shalay waxba maan samayn.
Not a little, but close	Ma yara, laakiin dhow
He is happy.	Wuu faraxsan yahay.
Someone came first.	Qof baa markii hore meesha yimid.
So far she has refused to comment.	Ilaa hadda way diiday inay wax ka sheegto.
And now you will have time for other things.	Oo hadda waxaad waqti u heli doontaa waxyaabo kale.
No one wants that.	Qofna taas ma rabo.
If there are any problems, please, let me know.	Haddii ay jiraan wax dhibaato ah, fadlan, ii soo sheeg.
But now she will.	Laakiin hadda way sameyn doontaa.
Until left.	Ilaa laga tago.
Very beautiful this.	Aad u qurux badan tan.
It does not separate.	Ma kala tago.
Maybe I even have one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa hal maalin haysto.
In fact, it is not one problem.	Runtii, hal dhibaato maaha.
Very good.	Aad u wanaagsan.
I just can't find it	Kaliya ma heli karo
There are other things as well.	Waxyaabo kale ayaa sidoo kale jira.
It really is a beautiful work.	Runtii waa shaqo qurux badan.
They just won’t get it.	Kaliya ma heli doonaan.
If you can't, it's not.	Haddii aadan awoodin, ma aha.
I took someone.	Qof baan qaatay.
But today is lucky.	Laakiin maanta waa nasiib.
He was surprised, he knew.	Yaab buu ahaa, wuu ogaa.
It also looks like a lot of work.	Waxa kale oo ay u egtahay shaqo badan.
I am also happy.	sidoo kale waan ku faraxsanahay.
It would give us something to do.	Waxay na siin lahayd wax aan samayno.
I wanted it from there.	halkaas ayaan ka rabay.
Really, it’s hard.	Runtii, way adag tahay.
I don't want you to tell anyone.	Ma rabo inaad cidna u sheegto.
This is a problem right now.	Tani waa dhibaato hadda.
I'm not sure if this is true.	Ma hubo inay tani sax tahay.
In fact, they haven't done anything for a while.	Dhab ahaantii, waxba ma ay qaban in muddo ah.
They could no longer do this.	Mar dambe ma ay samayn karin tan.
She missed that.	Way wayday taas.
This is something you can't tell me.	Tani waa waxa aadan ii sheegi karin.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
But now something good has happened.	Laakiin hadda wax wanaagsan ayaa dhacay.
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
It was clear he really wanted to go.	Waxay ahayd cad inuu runtii doonayo inuu tago.
It was definitely unseen.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aan arag.
Not sure where yet.	Ma hubo meel weli.
But don't take too long.	Laakiin waqti dheer ha qaadan.
How bad it is.	Sidee u xun tahay.
He seems to be where he is now.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa in uu yahay meesha uu hadda joogo.
Maybe I should do it somewhere else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan meel kale ku sameeyo.
But now, there is not much new.	Laakiin hadda, ma jiraan wax badan oo cusub.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Idont want.	Ma doonayo.
There had to be something.	Waxay ahayd inay wax jiraan.
I just can't do it	Kaliya ma samayn karo
I really wasn't.	Runtii ma aanan ahayn.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay taasi tahay.
More and more did.	Wax badan iyo in ka badan ayaa sameeyay.
I still don't feel good.	Wali ma dareemayo wax fiican.
It really was a good time.	Runtii waxay ahayd wakhti fiican.
This is urgent	Tani waa degdeg
You are new to people.	Waa kugu cusub dadka.
I'm happy	Waan ku faraxsanahay
He wanted something.	Wax buu rabay.
That is the best place to be.	Taasi waa meesha ugu fiican ee la joogo.
It was so, very good.	Waxay ahayd sidaas, aad u wanaagsan.
Maybe he shouldn't have said anything.	Malaha ma ahayn inuu wax sheego.
Unemployment, unemployment, unemployment.	Shaqo la'aan, shaqo la'aan, shaqo la'aan.
Nothing really was done.	Runtii waxba lama samayn.
I think the people there.	Waxaan u malaynayaa dadka meesha joogay.
There is no problem here.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan halkan.
I didn't want that.	Ma rabin taas.
The same thing you are doing now.	Wax la mid ah oo aad hadda samaynayso.
Something had to be done.	Wax ay ahayd in la sameeyo.
He was ready to go again.	Wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu mar kale tago.
Everyone is driving now.	Qof walba hadda wada.
This was not true.	Tani run ma ahayn.
It must be known first.	Waa in marka hore la ogaado.
This is not for me! 	Tani aniga ma aha!
.	.
He must be surprised by other things.	Waa inuu waxyaabo kale la yaabaa.
This is enough.	Tani waa ku filan tahay.
I didn't have time to talk.	Waqti aan la hadlo maan helin.
You do not have to like it.	Uma baahnid inaad jeceshahay.
Same for everyone.	La mid ah qof walba.
I felt that, you know.	Waxaan dareemay taas, waad ogtahay.
He wondered if he still knew.	Waxa uu is waydiiyay in uu weli garanayo.
Tan and more.	Tan kuma karin karin.
I hope it is true.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in ay run tahay.
We will see how this will be !.	Waan arki doonaa sida ay tani noqon doonto!.
This was a problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhibaato.
I would be there all the time.	Waxaan joogi lahaa halkaas mar walba.
Maybe she told him.	Malaha way u sheegtay.
That has always been great.	Taasi had iyo jeer waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
There is, always.	Waxaa jira, had iyo jeer.
I knew it would come out, one day.	Waan ogaa inay soo bixi doonto, maalin.
I would love for someone to do that.	Waxaan aad u jeclaan lahaa in qof sidaas sameeyo.
I still love it	Wali waan jeclahay
Something strange happened.	Wax la yaab leh ayaa ka dhacay.
It certainly felt there.	Waxaa hubaal ah in halkaas laga dareemay.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay isaga.
I would come back, but I have nowhere to go.	Dib ayaan u soo noqon lahaa, laakiin meel aan aado ma jirto.
Certainly not true.	Dhab ahaantii run maaha.
But there is not much time.	Laakiin waqti badan ma jiro.
I need more food.	Waxaan u baahanahay cunto badan.
I can see who she is here.	Waxaan halkan ka arki karaa cidda ay tahay.
It will be uninteresting.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid aan xiiso lahayn.
It’s a job, after all.	Waa shaqo, ka dib oo dhan.
They did not.	Ma ay qaban.
This is everything.	Tani waa wax walba.
He wanted me.	Wuu i rabay.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in badan.
Not yesterday.	Shalay ma jirto.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
It didn't hurt me	Wax dhib ah ima samayn
I still want you	wali waan ku rabaa
See exactly what you want.	Si sax ah u arag waxaad rabto.
So what she is doing now.	Ee waxa ay hadda samaynayso.
No one will do it.	Qofna ma yeeli doono.
would not come	ma iman lahayd
was not ready.	diyaar ma ahayn.
He came in.	Wuu soo galay.
As before.	Sidii hore oo kale.
No one else knew she was here.	Qof kale ma ogayn inay halkan joogto.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan run ahayn.
It was so beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan waxay ahayd.
This can be difficult to do on your own.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid adag inaad keligaa sameyso.
No one knew what had happened to him.	Qofna ma ogayn waxa ku dhacay.
It's better to go	Waxaa fiican inaan tago
He is being held.	Isaga ayaa loo hayaa.
I liked that he said that.	Waan ka helay in uu sidaas yidhi.
That will be more than enough time.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa waqti ka badan ku filan.
I would love to do it	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan sameeyo
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha .
Let it do.	Ha sameeyo.
Which is not a big deal.	Taas oo aan ahayn wax weyn.
But he did not.	Laakiin taas ma uu samayn.
Maybe you did too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad sidoo kale samaysay.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
But no one can say why.	Laakiin qofna ma sheegi karo sababta.
I haven't seen anyone but you so far.	Qof aan adiga ahayn ma arag ilaa hadda.
She loves everyone.	Waxay jeceshahay qof walba.
Stop! 	Jooji!
I wanted to know why.	Waxaan rabay inaan ogaado sababta.
But as it was.	Laakiin sida ay ahayd.
I want to know what he knows.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado wuxuu yaqaan.
Maybe this is not surprising.	Malaha tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
A very beautiful person.	Qof aad u qurux badan.
We are best friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo isku fiican.
Which is not surprising.	Taas oo aan la yaab lahayn.
It should not exist.	Waa in aanay jirin.
You can't go there	Halkaas ma aadi kartid
Not sure why either.	Ma hubo sababta sidoo kale.
I hope you can help.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad caawin karto.
I wanted to talk to you first.	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo marka hore.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Waa inaad u baahan tahay oo kaliya inaad sameyso.
I hope you can enjoy it	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ka heli karto
He has difficulty speaking.	Wuu ku adag yahay inuu hadlo.
Surprisingly, this has not yet been paid.	Waxa la yaab leh, tan weli lama bixin.
I'm out now	Hadda waan baxay
He would get a job there.	Halkaas ayuu shaqo ka heli lahaa.
That's not how it is done.	Taasi maaha sida loo sameeyo.
I got that.	Waxaan helay taas.
I want to see him happy.	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko isaga oo faraxsan.
No one had time.	Qofna waqti uma helin.
There is nothing else in the room.	Wax kale ma jiro qolka.
Let me do it again.	Aan dib u sameeyo.
What the least.	Maxaa ugu yar.
But it also cannot be.	Laakiin sidoo kale ma noqon karto.
In fact, this is to be expected.	Run ahaantii, tani waa in la filayaa.
Just out of it.	Kaliya ka soo baxay.
Not only that, you will be bad.	Ma aha oo kaliya, waxaad noqon doontaa mid xun.
He wanted her to stay.	Wuxuu rabay inay joogto.
Whether she wants to or not.	Haddii ay rabto iyo in kale.
They will not be like him.	Isaga oo kale ma noqon doonaan.
I am not here to cause trouble.	Uma joogo inaan dhib sameeyo.
You will find everything you want right here.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa wax kasta oo aad rabto isla halkan.
you will do.	waxaad sameyn doontaa .
Ah! 	Ah!
I know you are there.	Waan ogahay inaad halkaas ku jirto.
For me it was awful.	Aniga waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
It’s all me.	Waa aniga oo dhan.
Now everyone is everywhere.	Hadda qof walba meel walba wuu joogaa.
I know who you really are.	Waan ogahay qofka aad tahay runtii.
I would love to learn and learn more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan barto oo aan wax badan barto.
As he never did.	Sidii uu waligiis taas sameeyay.
He was serious.	Si dhab ah ayuu u ahaa.
Maybe more than once.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan hal mar.
It is not the owner.	Ma aha cidda iska leh.
You can see why it can take time.	Waad arki kartaa sababta ay u qaadan karto waqti.
It felt right.	Waxa la dareemay in ay sax tahay.
She thinks maybe.	Waxay u malaynaysaa malaha.
Really good work there.	Runtii shaqo fiican halkaas.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
This will be a problem.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa dhibaato.
I used to talk to him.	Waan la hadli jiray.
Too much.	Mid aad u badan.
And even if you are not here.	Iyo xitaa haddii aadan halkan joogin.
He still thinks they are a bit weird.	Weli wuxuu u malaynayaa inay xoogaa la yaab leh yihiin.
But it really is.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii waa.
That is not the same.	Taasi isku mid maaha.
I didn't know he wanted to.	Maan garanayn inuu doonayo.
This is not a coincidence.	Tani maaha wax iska dhacay.
Don't let anyone tell you you can't do it.	Ha u ogolaan qofna inuu kuu sheego inaadan samayn karin.
But it has to be done.	Laakiin waa in la sameeyaa.
It doesn't look great.	Uma eka mid weyn.
And after all.	Oo ka dib oo dhan .
I love everyone.	Waan jeclahay qof walba.
It is very good now.	Hadda aad bay u fiican tahay.
We are best friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo isku fiican.
It's work	Waa shaqo
Maybe he didn't.	Malaha ma uusan lahayn.
There is no better time than now.	Ma jiro wakhti ka fiican hadda.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
It's hard to be together.	Way adag tahay in la wada noqdo.
He looked good.	Si wanaagsan buu u eegay.
Nor did they report any major problems.	Sidoo kale ma aysan soo sheegin dhibaato weyn.
I have no idea who he is.	Wax fikrad ah kama qabo isaga.
No problem, after all.	Dhibaato ma jirin, ka dib.
I can no longer speak.	Mar dambe ma hadli karo.
It would really happen.	Runtii way dhici lahayd.
I could no longer do that.	Mar dambe ma aan qaban karin taas.
You are right.	Run baad tahay.
It's bad for you.	Way kuu xun tahay.
You have to be smart.	Waa in aad caqli leedahay.
It is known to everyone.	Waa la yaqaan qof walba.
But he needs money.	Laakiin wuxuu u baahan yahay lacag.
But enough of this.	Laakiin ku filan tan.
I hope you can enjoy it	Waxaan filayaa in aad ka heli karto
Obviously I will do that.	Sida cad waan sameyn doonaa taas.
That will give you a better idea.	Taasi waxay ku siin doontaa fikrad fiican.
It's really hard.	Runtii aad bay u adag tahay.
I will no longer be with anyone.	Mar dambe qof la joogi maayo.
We will stay here	Waanu joogi doonaa halkan
But it was great.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid weyn.
At first she could not see.	Markii hore way arki weyday.
It’s so much worse than that, really.	Aad bay uga xun tahay taas, runtii.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
John looked happy.	John wuxuu u muuqday mid faraxsan.
There are new good things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo cusub oo wanaagsan.
There is no such thing anywhere.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah meel kasta.
I didn’t know that.	Maan ogayn taas.
We are really good friends.	Runtii waxaan nahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
No one had any idea.	Qofna wax fikrad ah ma lahayn.
Good man.	Nin wanaagsan.
Has he always been.	Miyuu mar walba ahaa .
That can be a problem.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato.
You know it has to be done.	Waad ogtahay inay tahay in la sameeyo.
Still that is a little surprising.	Weli taasi waa wax yar oo la yaab leh.
I would leave	Waan ka bixi lahaa
Let him talk.	Ha la hadlo.
It has always been done.	Had iyo jeer waa la sameeyay.
Here is something you may not see.	Halkan wax laga yaabo inaadan arki doonin.
It is really good for me.	Runtii way ii fiican tahay.
A few of them too.	In yar oo ka mid ah sidoo kale.
She's really smart.	Runtii way caqli badan tahay.
I thought you would like to know that.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeclaan lahayd inaad taas ogaato.
I found.	waan helay.
I couldn't do more	Wax ka badan ma karin
I just didn’t go.	Kaliya ma tagin.
I always love to see you here.	Mar walba waan jeclahay inaan ku arko halkan.
But problematic.	Laakiin dhibaato leh.
He would be close by.	Meel u dhow ayuu joogi lahaa.
There is still more to come.	Weli wax kale ayaa soo socda.
Now she loves it.	Hadda way jeceshahay.
Everything is fine now.	Wax walba hadda way wanaagsan yihiin.
It certainly can’t be that hard.	Hubaal ma noqon karto mid adag.
John a while ago.	John wax yar ka hor.
It can be even worse.	Waxay noqon kartaa xitaa ugu xun.
It was just the best.	Waxay ahayd kaliya ugu fiican.
No one lives there now.	Ma jiro qof halkaas ku nool hadda.
I lost a friend.	Waxaan waayay saaxiib.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax fiican.
It will not always be.	Had iyo jeer ma ahaan doonto.
There are other things.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale.
Not too big, not too small.	Ma aha mid aad u weyn, ma yar.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
He should not have existed.	Ma ahayn inuu jiro.
I have nothing.	Waxba ma hayo.
I left you.	waan kaa tagay.
We do not do that.	Taas ma samayno.
You know, that's great.	Waad ogtahay, taasi way weyn tahay.
Maybe something happened to him.	Malaha wax baa ku dhacay.
Would come again.	Mar kale iman lahaa.
He wants money.	Lacag ayuu u rabaa.
Not everyone likes the same thing.	Qof kastaa ma jecla wax la mid ah.
Lots of money.	Lacag badan.
A man will come out.	Nin ayaa soo bixi doona.
Whatever he feels.	Wax kasta oo uu dareemayo.
bad.	xun.
I did better than that.	Waxaan sameeyay wax ka fiican taas.
I can be anything, anyone.	Waxaan noqon karaa wax kasta, qof kasta.
He owes you and all.	Waxa uu kugu leeyahay iyo dhammaan.
I want to go	Waxaan rabaa inaan tago
I will do nothing else.	Wax kale ma sameyn doono.
I have never seen anything so difficult.	Weligay ma arag wax sidaas u adag.
Yesterday was a beautiful day.	Shalay waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
I had one.	Mid baan ku lahaa.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu doonayo inuu iibsado.
I tried that.	Waan isku dayay taas.
But he could not believe it.	Laakiin wuu rumaysan waayay.
I have seen this before.	Tan hore ayaan u arkay.
There really isn’t much to say.	Runtii ma jiraan wax badan oo la sheego.
And a lot of work.	Iyo shaqo badan.
I'm not sure.	Ma hubo kan kan .
I think there is something.	Waxaan filayaa in ay wax jiraan.
Maybe he wanted it fast.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu si degdeg ah u rabay.
There was nothing else to do here.	Ma jirin wax kale oo halkan lagu sameeyo.
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
I know how much you would like to do that.	Waan ogahay sida aad jeceshahay inaad taas samayso.
No matter what you want.	Dhib malaha waxaad rabto.
Yes, time and time again.	Waa, waqti iyo waqti mar kale.
I was a little surprised.	Waan yara yaabay.
To find out more.	Si loo sii ogaado.
She is happy.	Way faraxsan tahay.
She still loves him.	Wali way jeceshahay isaga.
That will happen.	Taasi way dhici doontaa.
I'm just happy to see it.	Kaliya waan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko.
Otherwise, it did not come.	Haddii kale, ma iman.
I really enjoyed that.	Aad ayaan uga helay taas.
You would really help me.	Runtii waad i caawin lahayd.
As it can be.	Sida ay noqon karto.
What happened.	Maxaa ku dhacay.
That is the outcome.	Taasi waa waxa ka soo baxay.
I would always like to eat one.	Had iyo jeer waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan mid cuno.
Tell someone everything.	Wax walba qof u sheeg.
No problem	Wax dhibaato ah malaha
What could it be? 	Maxay noqon kartaa?
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
I have seen several.	Waxaan arkay dhowr.
Really, it was awful.	Run ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
I wonder why he is here.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta uu halkan u joogo.
it's amazing.	waa yaab .
That is the only thing it does.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay sameyso.
But he never did.	Laakiin waligiis ma samayn.
He knew he had to say a lot.	Wuu ogaa inuu wax badan sheego.
You are always beautiful.	Had iyo jeer waad qurux badan tahay.
I would love to see that	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko
Maybe we can help each other.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan is caawin karno.
But there may be more than that.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax ka badan taas.
That is very good.	Taasi waa mid aad u fiican.
A new man.	Nin cusub.
Until tomorrow for sure.	Ilaa berri hubaal.
You can still see.	Weli waad arki kartaa.
This, too, is rejected.	Tani, sidoo kale, waa la diiday.
And you must not say anything.	Oo waa inaadan waxba odhan.
This cannot happen.	Tani ma dhici karto.
Do it right.	Si sax ah u qabo.
You can't stay here all the time.	Ma joogi karto halkan mar walba.
And this is for sure.	Oo tani waa dhab ahaan.
Money is scarce.	Lacag ayaa ku yar.
I will not return here.	Halkan kuma noqon doono.
It's true.	Waa run.
It was just a good time.	Waxa uu ahaa kaliya waqti fiican.
It is really beautiful	Runtii waa qurux
It’s all we can do.	Waa waxa aan samayn karno oo dhan.
A small meal.	Cunto yar .
For me this is complicated.	Aniga ahaan tani waa dhib badan.
I would be fine.	Waan ku fiicnaan lahaa.
There is nothing complicated.	Ma jiraan wax adag.
But he did not like what he found.	Laakiin ma uu jeclayn waxa uu helay.
Everyone is still.	Qof kastaa wuu weli.
I would not say much.	Wax badan ma odhan lahaa.
She didn't think it was a good idea.	Uma ay malaynayn inay wax ku fiican tahay.
I was just surprised.	Kaliya waan yaabay.
It’s how happy you are, but more so.	Waa sida aad u faraxsan tahay, laakiin in ka badan.
I'm very happy!.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay!.
Made him leave.	Ka dhigay inuu baxo.
Everyone is the same.	Qof walba waa isku mid.
Not much of a surprise.	Wax badan oo la yaab leh maaha.
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad fiican.
I have to say first.	Waa inaan marka hore sheego.
I would see him soon.	Waxaan arki lahaa isaga dhawaan.
But we are constant, even when it is difficult.	Laakiin waxaan nahay joogto ah, xitaa marka ay adag tahay.
I like it	waan ka helay
We will do that.	Waan qaban doonaa taas.
He does not leave.	Ma baxo.
It's still bad.	Weli way xun tahay.
It was too much.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
Anyone can do it.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa.
He wanted to do it.	Wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo.
I can't come back.	Kuma soo noqon karo.
Don't stop, please.	Ha joojin, fadlan.
More, more, more.	Wax badan, ka badan, ka badan.
He would stay now.	Hadda wuu joogi lahaa.
Nor should it be.	Sidoo kale waa inaysan noqon.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
Really, it was fun.	Run ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
You could do whatever you wanted.	Waxaad samayn lahayd waxaad doonto.
But really somewhere else.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii meel kale.
I can tell you more.	Wax badan ayaan kuu sheegi karaa.
That’s a lot.	Taasi waa wax aad u badan.
Maybe that's true.	Malaha taasi waa run.
Not until much later.	Ma aha ilaa wax badan ka dib.
He will do whatever needs to be done.	Wuxuu samayn doonaa wax kasta oo ay tahay in la sameeyo.
You made a promise.	Ballan baad qaaday.
You really don't need anyone else.	Runtii uma baahnid qof kale.
Although we do not know.	In kasta oo aanu garanayn.
I really enjoyed it	Aad ayaan uga helay
Someone would come out.	Qof ayaa ka soo bixi lahaa.
And you have.	Oo aad leedahay.
I will address a few here.	Waxaan wax ka qaban doonaa dhowr halkan.
This is what happened to me.	Tani waa waxa igu dhacay.
The back room is very small, really.	Qolka dambe aad buu u yar yahay, runtii.
.	.
But something else was also true.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa sidoo kale run ahaa.
It can be many things.	Waxay noqon kartaa waxyaabo badan.
I will assume that this is so.	Waxaan u qaadan doonaa in tani ay sidaas tahay.
We will see what I can do	Waan arki doonaa waxaan samayn karo
He looked again.	Mar kale ayuu dib u eegay.
He had me.	Wuu i lahaa .
It’s all in me just like me.	Dhammaan waa aniga oo igu jira sida aniga oo kale.
Don't do too much.	Wax weyn ha samayn.
I wanted to help others.	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo dadka kale.
I’m not sure if it’s a good thing or not.	Ma hubo in ay tahay wax fiican oo aan ahayn.
They will stay here.	Way sii joogi doonaan halkan.
As it is now launched	Sida hadda la bilaabay
She should have known.	Waxay ahayd inay ogaato.
Much was as he left.	Wax badan ayaa ahaa sidii uu uga tagay.
Not here, he said.	Ma aha halkan, ayuu yidhi.
No one returned home.	Qofna dib uma uu noqon guriga.
It would not have stopped.	Lama joojin lahayn.
There, too, it will be stopped.	Halkaas, sidoo kale, ayaa lagu joojin doonaa.
It's from the people.	Waa ka dadka.
That is why they are not at home.	Taasi waa sababta aysan guriga joogin.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
It was not me.	Aniga ma ahayn.
There is some certainty	Waxaa jira xoogaa hubaal ah
And so on, and so forth.	Iyo wixii la mid ah, iyo wixii la mid ah.
Just amazing.	Kaliya yaab leh.
You love me.	Waad i jeceshahay.
I think it's better.	Waxaan qabaa inay ka wanaagsan tahay.
You know she likes it.	Waad ogtahay inay jeceshahay.
You are a tough guy.	Waxaad tahay nin adag.
Something else really.	Wax kale run ahaantii.
I did not understand him.	Ma fahmin isaga.
Very beautiful and beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan oo qurux badan.
I am not	Ma ihi
It is too.	Waa sidoo kale.
He is here with us.	Halkan ayuu nala joogaa.
It came out to me.	Waxaa igu soo baxay.
I have never won anything.	Weligay waxba kama aan guulaysan.
Definitely more today.	Hubaal in ka badan maanta.
But everything but.	Laakiin wax walba laakiin.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan.
Something is nearby.	Wax baa u dhow.
And it still is.	Oo weli waa.
He has many friends.	Waxa uu leeyahay saaxiibo badan.
It was all money.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd lacag.
And you were constant.	Oo waxaad ahayd mid joogto ah.
They should not have.	Waa inaysan haysan.
I could not leave	Waan ka bixi waayay
He has to be here somewhere.	Waa inuu halkan joogo meel.
I wonder why ?.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sababta?.
I started to leave.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan baxo.
That is an empty space.	Taasi waa meel aan waxba ahayn.
She's really smart.	Runtii way caqli badan tahay.
Not like yesterday.	Ma aha sidii shalay.
This is what you really are.	Tani waa waxa aad runtii tahay.
Still, she did.	Weli, way samaysay.
A little too familiar may be.	Wax yar oo aad loo yaqaan ayaa laga yaabaa.
I love you so much, I love you so much.	Aad baan kuu jeclahay, aad ayaan kuu jeclahay.
I really hope he can help me.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa inuu i caawin karo.
This is what you are very good at.	Tani waa waxa aad u fiican tahay.
He was one of us.	Wuxuu ahaa mid naga mid ah.
You can't get better.	Ma heli kartid si ka sii wanaagsan.
This was for sure.	Tani waxay ahayd hubaal.
We will discuss it again soon.	Mar kale ayaan wada hadli doonaa dhawaan.
But he didn’t have much else to work with.	Laakiin ma haysan wax kale oo badan oo uu la shaqeeyo.
No one can do the job.	Qofna ma qaban karo shaqada.
That? 	Taasi?
It probably was a good thing.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
Beautiful, beautiful day.	Qurux, maalin qurux badan.
I have not seen anyone.	Qofna maan arag.
I just don’t want to do it again.	Kaliya ma doonayo inaan mar dambe sameeyo.
It doesn't matter who owns it.	Dhib badan ma leh cidda leh.
It needs space.	Waxay u baahan tahay meel.
No one lives there.	Ma jiro qof halkaas ku nool.
I just don’t feel it.	Kaliya ma dareemayo.
You will love it here	Waad ku jeclaan doontaa halkan
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay kan.
But he knew very little about it.	Laakiin wax yar ayuu ka ogaa.
I wonder who lives there now.	Waxaan la yaabanahay cidda hadda ku nool.
But she realized she couldn't.	Laakiin way ogaatay inaysan awoodin.
I know how they are.	Waan ogahay sida ay yihiin.
I don't think this will happen anytime soon.	Uma maleynayo inay tani dhici doonto dhawaan.
In the same way as it always has been.	Si la mid ah sidii ay had iyo jeer ahayd.
It was what he really wanted.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu runtii rabay.
I am in it now	hadda waan ku jiraa
And, there was something else.	Oo, wax kale ayaa jiray.
She told him she was busy.	Waxay u sheegtay inay mashquul tahay.
It can be very interesting.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I think it was beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ahaa mid qurux badan.
One just needs to go and eat.	Mid ayaa loo baahan yahay oo kaliya inuu tago oo wax cuno.
How to do it.	Sida loo sameeyo.
Something else is needed.	Wax kale ayaa loo baahan yahay.
He lost well.	Wuu waayay si fiican.
Not at work, not at home.	Ma aha shaqada, ma aha guriga.
I don't want to learn.	Ma rabo inaan barto.
He heard me.	Wuu i maqlay.
I think that really is.	Waxaan filayaa in taasi runtii tahay.
I'll talk about it again later.	Waxaan ka hadli doonaa mar kale wax yar ka dib.
This can be done with any job.	Tani waxaa lagu samayn karaa shaqo kasta.
I am very happy with what is coming.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay waxa soo socda.
There was so much more to do.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo aad u badan oo la samayn lahaa.
I want to be in this one.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ku jiro kan.
A bit hard to find.	Xoogaa adag in la helo.
Not me, but me.	Aniga ma aha, laakiin aniga.
Otherwise, it is not interesting.	Haddii kale, ma xiiso.
This was familiar.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la yaqaan.
I think that was a little while ago.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ahayd wax yar ka hor.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn.
There is more.	Wax ka badan ayaa jira.
Still not beautiful.	Weli qurux la'aan.
This is where you could be better off.	Tani waa meesha aad ka sii fiicnaan lahayd.
Everyone knows, everyone.	Qof kastaa wuu ogyahay, qof walba.
He knew very well.	Si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
No one talks much.	Qofna wax badan ma hadlo.
He just refused to do that to me.	Kaliya wuu diiday inuu sidaas igu sameeyo.
But that cannot be.	Laakiin taasi ma noqon karto.
Something he loves.	Wax uu jecel yahay.
And something to eat as well.	Iyo wax la cuno sidoo kale.
What is everyone.	Waa maxay qof walba.
He's gone now.	Hadda ayuu baxay.
We can't stop now.	Hadda ma joojin karno.
There is no time to do anything.	Ma jiro wakhti wax lagu sameeyo.
More than today.	In ka badan maanta.
I will help, too.	Waan caawin doonaa, sidoo kale.
It’s all you can do.	Waa wax walba oo aad sameyn karto.
I made one	Mid baan sameeyay
Really love him.	Runtii isaga jecel.
And it is still real.	Oo weli waa dhab.
It is not permanent.	Ma aha joogto ah.
Really good job.	Runtii shaqo fiican.
One man may be talked about.	Hal nin ayaa laga yaabaa in laga hadlo.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
I'm sure it's very good.	Waxaan hubaa inay aad ugu fiican tahay.
I am so glad you did.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad samaysay.
But only if it is actually better.	Laakiin kaliya haddii ay dhab ahaantii ka fiican tahay.
He was very much.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u badan.
I'm not sure you will.	Ma hubo inaad yeeli doonto.
At first she didn't want to.	Markii hore ma ay rabin.
I didn't want to talk.	Maan rabin inaan hadlo.
He has always been.	Wuxuu had iyo jeer ahaa.
That was what came out.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa soo baxay.
One white.	Mid cad.
Take everything you want.	Qaado dhammaan waxaad rabto.
She is very happy too.	Aad bay u faraxsan tahay xitaa.
Now he refuses.	Hadda wuu diiday.
You may not be either.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan sidoo kale ahayn.
.	.
It was the best.	Waxay ahayd tan ugu fiican.
I tried it for a while.	Waxaan isku dayay waqti.
I want to do better	Waxaan rabaa inaan si ka wanaagsan sameeyo
If you are, you are.	Haddii aad tahay, waxaad tahay.
He would tell us what he thought.	Wuxuu noo sheegi lahaa waxa uu la yahay.
I want everyone to get the best out of it.	Waxaan rabaa in qof walba uu helo waxa ugu fiican.
Very good man.	Nin aad u fiican.
A little will be with you.	Wax yar ayaa kula joogi doona.
I should not have lied.	Ma ahayn in aan been sheego.
I love being with you	Waxaan jeclahay inaan kula joogo
They are in school.	Waxay ku jiraan dugsiga.
That he took a little from me.	In uu wax yar iga qaatay.
I never did, you know.	Weligay maan samayn, waad ogtahay.
we desperately need it	aad ayaan ugu baahanahay
No one has it now.	Qofna hadda ma hayo.
You only need a few.	Waxa aad u baahan tahay wax yar oo kaliya.
not much yet.	ma badna weli.
Give the place once.	Meesha hal mar sii.
I think it's more than enough.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay ka badan tahay ku filan.
I wish you were still there.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad weli halkaas joogto.
I was not surprised.	La yaab kuma ahayn.
Here he was alone.	Halkan ayuu keligiis ahaa.
It had to be done early with us.	Waxay ahayd in wakhti hore nala sameeyo.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
But it is still something.	Laakiin weli waa wax.
Why, really.	Waa maxay sababta, runtii.
It will all be fine.	Dhammaan way fiicnaan doontaa.
Things are not as they should be.	Wax sidii la rabay ma aha.
It really was a good idea.	Runtii waxay ahayd fikrad wanaagsan.
Let me just tell you.	Kaliya aan kuu sheego.
Not sure what I need.	Ma hubo waxa aan u baahanahay.
As always it is.	Sida had iyo jeer waa.
He looked very good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u wanaagsan.
He came to me.	Wuu ii yimid.
Tell me why that is again.	Ii sheeg sababta taasi mar kale tahay.
It was only one year.	Waxay ahayd hal sano oo kaliya.
It can be anyone.	Waxay noqon kartaa qof kasta.
He really wants to help.	Runtii wuxuu rabaa inuu caawiyo.
They are obvious.	Waxay iska cad yihiin.
He was an amazing man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin yaab badan.
It was right where he wanted to be.	Waxay ahayd sax meesha uu rabo inuu joogo.
It is always good.	Had iyo jeer way fiican tahay.
They are not smart.	Uma caqli badna.
There was so much.	Wax badan baa jiray.
He was lucky to find it at home.	Wuxuu nasiib u helay inuu guriga ku helo.
There is everything to be done.	Waxaa jira wax kasta oo la sameeyo.
And, ah.	Oo, ah.
We were good friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo wanaagsan.
I looked, too.	Waan eegay, sidoo kale.
I will not do anything like that.	Wax sidaas oo kale ah ma yeeli doono.
But alone.	Laakiin keligiis.
She would love to do it.	Waxay jeclaan lahayd inay sameyso.
No one came out.	Qofna ma soo bixin.
There was nothing else to do.	Wax kale oo la qaban lahaa ma jirin.
Something you said to me.	Wax aad igu tidhi.
she could not take it.	way qaadan wayday.
But no one seems to have a problem.	Laakiin qofna uma eka in uu dhib ku qabo.
Keep it up here.	Halkan ku sii.
They should not take more than one year.	Waa inaysan qaadan wax ka badan hal sano.
I think it will happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici doonto.
Maybe he would be fine.	Malaha wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
Still, it was a while.	Weli, waxay ahayd muddo.
No one was present for some time.	In muddo ah qofna meesha ma joogin.
Today is not a day for me.	Maanta aniga ma ahan maalin.
I cant.	ma awoodo.
There was nothing surprising.	Ma jirin wax la yaab leh.
I still have it.	Wali waan hayaa.
He found us.	Wuu na helay.
He wants to be a part of it.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu ka mid noqdo.
Although we do, too.	In kasta oo aanu samayn, sidoo kale.
I have nothing else to say.	Ma hayo wax kale oo aan sheego.
Probably everywhere.	Malaha waa meel kasta.
Don't do that.	Ha samayn taas.
This is for you all.	Tani waa adiga oo dhan.
He found himself.	Isaga oo is helay.
Everything is correct he said.	Wax kasta oo sax ah ayuu sheegay.
Probably the best.	Malaha waxa ugu wanaagsan.
Not true.	Run maaha.
There is a lot going on for you.	Wax badan baa kuu socda.
he would get even.	wuu heli lahaa xitaa.
Whoever you are.	Qof kasta oo aad tahay.
He had no one else to see.	Ma uu haysan qof kale oo uu arko.
It's so amazing.	Aad bay u yaab badan tahay.
But in love.	Laakiin ee la jecel yahay.
It was no longer the same.	Isla mar dambe ma ahayn.
One good, one bad.	Mid wanaagsan, mid xun.
That is the worst thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu xun.
How did you know that.	Sidee ku ogaatay taas .
He said he was fine.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu fiican yahay.
I love you so much.	aad baan kuu jeclahay.
Ah I got it here.	Ah halkan ayaan ku helay.
I was good at that, you know.	Taas waan ku fiicnaan jiray, waad ogtahay.
He always does this.	Mar walba tan wuu sameeyaa.
You are a lucky man friend.	Nin nasiib leh ayaad tahay saaxiib.
Only this is true.	Kaliya tani waa run.
I only had one man.	Waxa aan lahaa hal nin oo kaliya.
You are as good as you are.	Waad ku fiican tahay sida aad tahay.
This is really amazing.	Runtii tani waa yaab.
He came in later.	Markii dambe ayuu soo galay.
I want you, just you.	waan ku rabaa adiga, adiga kaliya.
Always, everywhere.	Had iyo jeer, meel kasta.
He was not mentioned.	Isaga lama sheegin.
That's like this.	Taasi waa sida tan.
You made me.	Adiga ayaa iga dhigay.
This is really an interesting problem.	Tani dhab ahaantii waa dhibaato xiiso leh.
This was one.	Tani waxay ahayd mid.
I never said.	Weligay ma odhan.
She was very reluctant.	Aad bay u diiday.
There is no money.	Wax lacag ah maaha.
No real problem.	Dhib dhab ah malaha.
She was lucky.	Waxay ahayd nasiib badan.
So far, everything is fine.	Ilaa hadda, wax walba waa wanaagsan yihiin.
I don't tell anyone.	Qofna qofna uma sheego.
I should have told you first.	Waxay ahayd inaan marka hore kuu sheego.
I found that better	Taas ayaan ka helay si ka wanaagsan
Just stop being available	Kaliya jooji in la heli karo
Today is very good.	Maanta aad buu u fiican yahay.
Even a small one would do.	Xitaa mid yar ayaa sameyn lahaa.
I will talk to him.	Waan la hadli doonaa.
I have not seen anything live.	Wax nool ma arag.
I look forward to seeing everyone.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan arko qof walba.
It is no longer at the door.	Albaabka kuma sii jiro.
No one knew what he wanted to do.	Qofna ma ogayn wuxuu doonayo inuu sameeyo.
There is no big job, no small job.	Ma jiro shaqo aad u weyn, ma jiro shaqo aad u yar.
If he wanted to know, fine.	Haddii uu rabay inuu ogaado, fiican.
He knew you were in trouble.	Wuu ogaa inaad dhibaato ku jirto.
There is no one else like you.	Ma jiro qof kale oo adiga kula mid ah.
Maybe you.	Malaha adiga.
It looks bad.	Waxay u egtahay mid xun.
He must know it well.	Waa inuu si fiican u garanayaa.
He was a great man.	Nin weyn buu ahaa.
All very interesting.	Dhammaan aad u xiiso badan.
Only once.	Kaliya hal mar kaliya.
As always.	Sida had iyo jeer.
It was small.	Waxay ahayd mid yar.
Here it is.	Waa kan.
I wish I had that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas haysto.
All that is needed.	Dhammaan waxa loo baahan yahay .
All he wanted to do.	Dhammaan wuxuu rabay inuu sameeyo.
But now it must be done.	Laakiin hadda waa in la sameeyaa.
Every moment will come now.	Waqti kasta hadda way iman doontaa.
That is what is being held.	Taasi waa waxa loo haysto.
She said something about it.	Wax bay ka tidhi .
It is not a new idea.	Ma aha fikrad cusub.
Once upon a time he didn't need one.	Mar ka hor ma uusan u baahnayn mid.
You do not need	Uma baahnid
Obviously, everything comes with it.	Sida iska cad, wax kasta oo la socda.
But it was done.	Laakiin waa la sameeyay.
There was so much he did not know.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo uusan ogeyn.
I wanted you to take it regularly.	Waxaan rabay inaad si joogto ah u qaado.
There is always something to eat.	Mar walba waxaa jira wax la cuno.
He knows me.	Wuu i garanayaa.
I was surprised you weren’t there either, really.	Waxaan la yaabay inaadan sidoo kale halkaas joogin, dhab ahaantii.
I think it's not surprising.	Waxaan filayaa in aan la yaab lahayn.
It is a place to shop, nothing else.	Waa meel wax laga iibsado, wax kale ma aha.
I looked	Waan eegay
I hope you are like that.	Aan rajaynayo inaad sidaas tahay.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
You are smarter and smarter.	Waxaad tahay caqli badan oo caqli badan.
Here was an opportunity.	Halkan waxay ahayd fursad.
Maybe not even him, yet.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan xitaa isaga, weli.
A little harder.	In yar oo adag.
That's right, nothing.	Taasi waa sax, waxba.
I still have to see him.	Weli waa inaan arko isaga.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
It is now here	Hadda waa halkaan
For me this is amazing.	Aniga tani waa igu yaab.
He is here now.	Hadda wuu joogaa.
Everything you can expect.	Wax kasta oo aad filan karto.
I had to go back like that.	Waxaan ahaa inaan sidaas oo kale ku noqdo.
He is the best.	Isaga ayaa ugu fiican.
I can't think why, right now.	Ma u malayn karo sababta, hadda.
You did nothing.	Waxba ma aadan samayn.
This is a lot of money.	Tani waa lacag aad u badan.
that is it.	waa taas.
You can believe whatever you want.	Waad rumaysan kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
Maybe very close.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u dhow.
But with us.	Laakiin nala.
Anything and everything.	Wax kasta iyo wax kasta.
I will get another job.	Waxaan heli doonaa shaqo kale.
He is a great man.	Waa nin weyn.
This is the only thing.	Tani waa waxa kaliya.
I could not go home	Guriga ma aadi karin
There was so much they did not know.	Waxaa jiray wax badan oo aysan ogeyn.
But, he is good at it.	Laakiin, wuu ku fiican yahay.
He had to know where she was.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado meesha ay joogto.
He did not see.	Ma uusan arag.
This is probably the main reason.	Tani waxay u badan tahay inay tahay sababta ugu weyn.
As very good.	Sida aad u fiican.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
They may be much smaller.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax badan ka yar yihiin.
I took it quickly.	Si degdeg ah ayaan u qaatay.
It has been a long time.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer.
Bad place.	Meel xun.
I tried this one too.	Waxaan isku dayay kan sidoo kale.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
Just the same.	Kaliya isku mid.
I can't say otherwise.	Si kale uma sheegi karo.
Now that was not a bad idea.	Hadda taasi ma ahayn fikrad xun.
There is nothing good for people.	Ma jirto wax dadka u wanaagsan.
She would give that.	Way siin lahayd taas.
No one came here again.	Qofna halkan mar dambe ma iman.
Hopefully, he didn’t.	Waxaan rajeynayaa, ma uusan lahayn.
It is where she wants to be.	Waa meesha ay rabto inay joogto.
But it is true.	Laakiin waa run.
Still the best of the best.	Weli aad ugu fiican ugu weyn.
I didn't like it much.	In badan maan jeclayn.
But that can do better than that.	Laakiin taasi waxay samayn kartaa wax ka wanaagsan taas.
She said she would leave the house soon.	Waxay sheegtay inay dhawaan ka bixi doonto guriga.
Really, I really do.	Runtii, runtii waan sameeyaa.
It all contains the same.	Dhammaan waxa ku jira isku mid.
A little later, that.	Wax yar ka dib, in.
Don't tell me that.	Taas ha ii sheegin.
It didn't help	Waxba ma caawin
In fact, that is exactly what you have to do.	Dhab ahaantii, taasi waa dhab ahaan waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
There is a little bit of everything here.	Waxaa jira wax yar oo wax walba ah halkan.
Nothing else now.	Wax kale hadda ma jiraan.
I can't do anything better.	Wax ka fiican ma samayn karo.
He tried to speak.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu hadlo.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
It is too early.	Waa goor hore.
That is the best.	Taasi waa tan ugu fiican.
You are so beautiful.	Aad baad u qurux badan.
She said no one wanted to see me.	Waxay tidhi qofna ma rabo inuu i arko.
Please do not leave us.	Fadlan ha naga tagin.
I want to know why.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta.
Not only that.	Kaliya ma jirto.
I really am not.	Dhab ahaantii ma ihi.
I'm very happy	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay
As good as it may be.	Sida laga yaabo inay fiican tahay.
This is not what it is.	Tani maaha waxa ay tahay.
This, this is even more surprising.	Tani, tani waa xitaa ka sii yaab badan.
She would love to be there.	Way jeclaan lahayd inay halkaas joogto.
There are also a lot of unpopular things.	Waxa kale oo jira waxyaabo badan oo aan la jeclayn.
I do not live	Wax nool ma sameeyo
All in one place.	Dhammaan hal meel.
I felt lucky to have it.	Waxaan dareemay nasiib inaan haysto.
Not often.	Ma aha inta badan.
I will get another one.	Mid kale ayaan heli doonaa.
She did that.	Way samaysay taas.
It’s like everything else.	Waa sida wax kasta oo kale.
No one would like you.	Qofna kuma jeclaan lahaa.
He really loves you, you know.	Runtii wuu ku jecel yahay, waad ogtahay.
Give it to me now.	I sii hadda.
I can think of better.	Waxaan u malayn karaa in ka sii fiican.
take this.	tan qaado .
He said it would be good.	Wuxuu sheegay inay fiicnaan doonto.
Good job	Way fiican tahay shaqada
I know what went into it.	Waan ogahay waxa galay.
There is no chance right now.	Fursad hadda ma jirto.
But this will not do.	Laakiin tani ma yeeli doonto.
It is not always done.	Mar walba lama sameeyo.
I really am.	Runtii waan ahay .
He was very much.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u badan.
I really don't understand this.	Runtii tan ma fahmin.
I've seen that before.	Mar hore ayaan taas eegay.
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
Maybe still time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in weli waqti.
I have no problem with the opportunity to talk to him.	Wax dhib ah kama qabo fursad aan kula hadlo isaga.
This alone will not do.	Tani kaliya ma yeeli doonto.
And not a few people.	Oo ma aha dhowr qof.
It’s not the latest, but it’s still my favorite.	Ma ahan kan ugu cusub, laakiin waa ilaa hadda aan jeclahay.
.	.
There is always someone who needs you.	Had iyo jeer waxaa jira qof kuu baahan.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
Like everyone else, he wanted to go home.	Sida dadka kale, wuxuu rabay inuu guriga aado.
Here it is !.	Waa kan!.
Either way it can happen to you.	Si kasta oo ay kugu dhici karto.
You can't make money.	Lacag ma samayn karto.
Take only what you need.	Qaado kaliya waxaad u baahan tahay.
Which we do not.	Taas oo aanu samayn.
He did it for me.	Wuu igu sameeyay.
As such.	Sida oo kale.
Obviously, but it holds true.	Sida cad, laakiin run buu hayaa.
I didn't want to talk to him.	Ma rabin inaan la hadlo.
Let me see.	Aan arko.
Often this is not too difficult.	Inta badan tani maaha mid aad u adag.
I didn't like him.	Maan jeclayn isaga.
Bad and bad time.	Waqti xun oo xun.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
But it was not done.	Laakiin lama samayn.
So it was.	Sidaas ayuu ahaa.
And stop him.	Oo jooji isaga.
No one wanted to.	Qofna ma rabin.
But that is what he does.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa uu sameeyo.
I need to talk to you	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan kula hadlo
That's awful.	Taasi waa wax iska xun.
I always thought it was amazing.	Waxaan had iyo jeer u maleeyay in ay ahayd mid aad u yaab leh.
I have no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma hayo.
In fact, more so.	Dhab ahaantii, si ka sii badan.
He really wanted to know.	Runtii wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado.
He came in yesterday.	Shalay ayuu soo galay.
It is more than enough.	Waa in ka badan sidii la rabay.
No one spoke.	Qofna lama hadlin.
Please do not do this.	Fadlan taas ha samayn.
It could not be done.	Waa la qaban waayay.
He is very present.	Aad buu u joogaa.
I lied a lot.	been badan baan ka sheegay.
I will still get that.	Weli waan u heli doonaa taas.
I am an adult	Waxaan ahay qof weyn
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
But it is good for everyone.	Laakiin qof walba waa u wanaagsan yahay.
That was great for me.	Aniga taasi aad bay ii ahayd .
A lot of.	Wax badan oo .
This is for sure.	Tani waa hubaal.
They did not have it.	Ma ay haysan.
not only.	ma kaliya .
That he knew.	In uu ogaa.
.	.
He did not stop.	Ma uu joojin.
But if there is something you can do.	Laakiin haddii ay jiraan wax aad samayn karto .
It does not do that.	Taas ma samaynayso.
Don't do me the worst.	Ha igu samayn waxa ugu xun.
Definitely better than nothing.	Wax hubaal ah ayaa ka wanaagsan waxba.
That is really hard.	Taasi runtii way adag tahay.
I promised it would happen.	Waxaan u ballan qaaday inay dhici doonto.
He refused to do this.	Wuu diiday inuu tan sameeyo.
He knew he could.	Wuu ogaa inuu awoodo.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
That will not come as a surprise.	Taasi la yaab ma noqon doonto.
I am very happy to be here again.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale halkan ka helo.
You can get it	Waad heli kartaa
I did nothing	waxba maan qaban
That is not true.	Runtii taasi run maaha.
Maybe that's right.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sax tahay.
Everyone is fine.	Qof kastaa wuu fiican yahay.
Maybe it happened.	Malaha wuu dhacay.
I was a little surprised by this.	Waxaan xoogaa la yaabay tan.
Much will come to an end.	Wax badan baa dhammaan doona.
I always came back.	Mar walba waan soo noqday.
There may be more to come.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax badan oo soo socda.
That was unbelievable.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
New opportunity.	Fursad cusub.
But really.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii .
The hardest.	Ka ugu adag.
Something is going on.	Wax baa meesha ka socda.
But you can do that there, too.	Laakiin taas waxaad ka samayn kartaa halkaas, sidoo kale.
I don't even want to.	Xitaa ma rabo.
I don't know what to say.	Wax uu ku hadlo ma garanayo.
He was taken on strike.	Waa loo qaaday shaqo joojin.
Everyone you love here.	Qof kasta oo halkan aad jeceshahay.
He did not talk about it.	Ma uusan ka hadlin.
How good it is for you.	Sidee u fiican adiga.
I can't tell you why.	Sababta ayaan kuu sheegi waayay.
He went to John.	Wuxuu aaday john.
Let them all.	Ha wada haysto.
I need him to know that he is not alone.	Waxaan u baahanahay inuu ogaado inuusan keligiis ahayn.
Now it is the same here.	Hadda waa sidaas oo kale halkan.
No one spoke much.	Qofna in badan ma hadlin.
And it is very good.	Oo aad bay u fiican tahay.
That will not be long.	Sidaas ma ahaan doonto muddo dheer.
Nor was it so difficult.	Sidoo kale ma ahayn sidaas u adag.
The rest will not happen.	Inta kale ma dhici doonto.
Can you tell	Ma kuu sheegi kartaa
After a while she would allow it.	Wax yar ka dib way u ogolaan lahayd.
As he had heard before.	Sidii uu hore u maqlay.
It’s what you want, not me.	Waa waxa aad rabto, aniga ma aha.
There are no problems yet.	Wax dhib ah weli ma jiraan.
That is obvious.	Taasi waa wax iska cad.
That's right.	Sax, taasi waa.
That's how he feels now.	Sidaas ayuu hadda dareemay.
She was ready now.	Hadda diyaar bay ahayd.
Not yet.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan.
In fact, he seemed to come out of nowhere.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu u muuqday inuu meel walba ka soo baxay.
I think it's smart.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay caqli badan tahay.
But he found nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma uu helin.
Surprisingly what that looks like.	Si la yaab leh sida ay taasi u egtahay.
It can be anything.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax walba.
That's not it, he thought.	Taasi maaha, ayuu is yidhi.
I didn't want anything else.	Wax kale ma rabin.
I think it's good.	Waxaan qabaa inay fiican tahay.
Better time.	Waqti ka wanaagsan.
He has just started.	Hadda ayuu bilaabay.
Soon, maybe no more today.	Mar dhow, maanta dambe malaha.
Maybe he gets to talk to us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu helo inuu nala hadlo.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
I should have seen this earlier.	Waxay ahayd inaan tan hore u arko.
It is good for you.	Adiga ayaa kuu fiican.
It did not take long to do this.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer in tan la sameeyo.
I was not a person.	Anigu qof maan ahayn.
Less is always enough.	In ka yar ayaa had iyo jeer ku filan.
Surprisingly, is that enough ?.	Waxaa la yaab leh, ma ku filan tahay?.
I will talk more about it tomorrow.	Berri wax badan ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
This is not a problem.	Tani maaha dhibaato.
I left everything.	Wax walba waan ka tagay.
I have to tell you something.	Waa inaan wax kuu sheego.
I want to work for everything.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba u shaqeeyo.
Whatever he wanted, he got.	Wax kasta oo uu rabay, wuu helay.
There is nothing like him.	Ma jiraan wax isaga la jecel yahay.
That really, really, really good.	Taasi run ahaantii, runtii, runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
I think someone is.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in qof uu yahay.
tell me, tell me.	ii sheeg, ii sheeg.
I’m just not sure they do.	Kaliya ma hubo inay sameeyaan.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
I had no idea this was going to happen.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn inay tani iman doonto.
It is not.	Ma aha .
He walked in the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka soo galay.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga.
Someone came into the room.	Qof baa qolka soo galay.
Don't tell me that.	Taas ha ii sheegin.
See here and here.	Halkan iyo halkan ka arag.
I have no idea who he was.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo cidda uu ahaa.
It just isn’t permanent.	Kaliya maaha mid joogto ah.
Not all you need.	Ma aha dhammaan waxaad u baahan tahay.
She did it first.	Marka hore way samaysay.
It looks bad.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid xun.
The latter is done.	Tan dambe waa la sameeyay.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
Is that still the case?	Weli ma sidaas baa?.
At work, she had no idea.	Shaqada, ma ay lahayn wax fikrad ah.
Anything and everything.	Wax kasta iyo wax kasta.
John was a happy man.	John wuxuu ahaa nin faraxsan.
It was real to me, as always.	Waxay ii ahayd mid dhab ah, sida had iyo jeer.
But it was.	Laakiin waxay ahayd.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
Probably me.	Malaha aniga.
Unlucky for that too.	Nasiib ma leh taas sidoo kale.
That may not be true.	Taasi run ma noqon karto.
Which they did not.	Taas oo aanay samayn.
Who knows.	Yaa dadka yaqaan.
It can happen to us at any time.	Waxay nagu dhici kartaa wakhti kasta.
It is too late now.	Waqti ayaa ka dheer hadda.
That is why he came.	Waa sababta uu u yimid.
I started working	Waxaan bilaabay inaan shaqeeyo
Now nothing can be said.	Hadda wax la odhan karo ma jiraan.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
At school, too.	Dugsiga, sidoo kale.
I think it can happen.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhici karto.
I really don't know anyone.	Runtii qofna ma garanayo.
I think.	waxaan filayaa .
It was there available.	Waxay ahayd halkaas oo la heli karo.
Maybe she can stay with him now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay hadda la joogi karto isaga.
Please can you help me	Fadlan ma iga caawin kartaa
A better place.	Meel ka wanaagsan.
Everyone has a place.	Qof walba meel buu leeyahay.
You will also do this.	Waxaad sidoo kale samayn doontaa tan.
Close to home	U dhow guriga
But he is thought to have returned.	Laakiin loo malaynayo inuu soo noqday.
Surprisingly, she did.	Si la yaab leh, way samaysay.
It has not come out yet.	Wali ma soo bixin.
But even more money will be needed.	Laakiin xitaa lacag badan ayaa loo baahan doonaa.
Prison made everything it could be.	Xabsiga ayaa ka dhigay wax kasta oo uu noqon karo.
Take it.	Qaado.
Nice, little man.	Fiican, nin yar oo nin ah.
That will not hurt.	Taasi waxba ma yeeli doonto.
No one was there, he said.	Qofna ma ahayn, ayuu yidhi.
I would like to go	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan tago
In the same way.	Si la mid ah.
What's closest.	Maxaa ugu dhow .
He did not want money.	Ma uusan rabin lacag.
And maybe they will.	Oo malaha way yeeli doonaan.
That he made something.	In uu wax ka dhigay.
It was a lie.	Been bay ahayd.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay oo aad u fiican.
You were.	Waxaad ahayd .
I did not believe him.	Maan rumaysan isaga.
He did not need that.	Uma uu baahnayn taas.
It's too bad to see.	Waa wax aad u xun in la arko.
We will see how that is.	Waan arki doonaa sida ay taasi tahay.
I can't do that.	Taas ma awoodo.
He took a great opportunity for me.	Fursad weyn ayuu iga qaatay.
Everything and nothing.	Wax walba iyo waxba.
You know that.	Waad ogtahay taas.
So far, it is still ready.	Ilaa hadda, wali waa diyaar.
I hope you will soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa, inaad dhawaan doonto.
I really enjoyed it	Runtii aad ayaan uga helay
It was fun.	Waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
How can this happen?	Sidee tani u dhici kartaa.
It's just beautiful.	Kaliya waa qurux.
you did not.	ma aadan samayn.
I want you to do the same here.	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan ku sameyso wax la mid ah.
It is what everyone does.	Waa waxa qof walba sameeyo.
There is no money now.	Lacag kuma jirto hadda.
You know how.	Waad ogaatay sida.
I am sure it will come to me.	Waan hubaa inay ii iman doonto.
He did something amazing.	Wax yaab leh ayuu sameeyay.
That's really good.	Runtii taasi waa wax fiican.
He wanted to do something.	Wuxuu rabay inuu wax sameeyo.
I am very sorry.	Aad baan uga xumahay.
I really don't know.	Runtii ma garanayo.
He did not return.	Ma uu soo noqon.
So much better than before.	Si aad uga wanaagsan kii hore.
I don't know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxa la sameeyo.
But it is more than that.	Laakiin way ka badan tahay.
It should not be.	Waa in aanay noqon.
There is no need.	Ma jiraan wax u baahan.
it's great, you know.	wuu weyn yahay, waad ogtahay.
It was a full day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dhan.
You can leave	Waad bixi kartaa
I gave it a very good one today.	Waxaan siiyay mid aad u fiican maanta.
Not that he was bad.	Ma aha in uu ahaa mid xun.
I tried everything.	Wax walba waan isku dayay.
I wanted to do that for a long time.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas sameeyo wakhti dheer.
Here he comes.	Halkan ayuu soo galay.
She looks like him.	Waxay u egtahay isaga oo kale.
I left.	Waan ka baxay.
I will be fine	Waan fiicnaan doonaa
I decided for him.	Isaga ayaan go’aansaday.
It will be interesting.	Waxay ahaan doontaa mid xiiso badan.
This is a lot.	Tani waa wax aad u badan.
You can no longer give to anyone.	Maanta qofna wax dambe ma siin kartid.
Just an idea.	Kaliya fikrad.
I can't do anything	Waxba ma samayn karo
Very good man.	Nin aad u fiican.
I'm glad she's there.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inay halkaas joogto.
I just don’t know what else to do for him.	Kaliya ma garanayo wax kale oo aan u sameeyo isaga.
He really was with us long enough.	Runtii wuxuu nala joogay waqti ku filan.
He wants to be a man.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu nin noqdo.
It didn't pay much.	Wax badan ma bixin jirin.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
No man lives here.	Ma jiro nin halkan ku nool.
He said something.	Wax buu yidhi.
But a new problem has arisen.	Laakiin dhib cusub ayaa soo baxay.
That is the worst.	Taasi waa tan ugu xun.
It is a very difficult problem.	Waa dhibaato aad u adag.
It was not to be done.	Ma ahayn in la sameeyo.
Maybe you have one.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad mid leedahay.
I can believe it	Waan rumaysan karaa
This is true of all.	Tani waa run dhammaan.
He was recently released from prison.	Dhawaan ayuu xabsiga ka soo baxay.
Maybe a little less.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax yar ka yar.
He felt like he really came home.	Wuxuu dareemay sidii inuu runtii guriga yimid.
That was impossible.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan dhici karin.
And you must not tell anyone.	Oo waa inaadan cidna u sheegin.
Whenever you want.	Mar kasta oo aad rabto.
Not a little, that.	Wax yar maaha, taasi.
She did not say why.	Ma aysan sheegin sababta.
I still haven't won.	Wali ma guulaysan.
It was so hard that she could expect more.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u adag in ay filan karto in ka badan.
He could not believe he had done it.	Wuu rumaysan waayay inuu sameeyay.
He came every day.	Maalin walba wuu iman jiray.
I don't know who.	Ma garanayo cidda.
You may know more about the past.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad wax badan ka ogaato wixii hore.
They found nothing.	Waxba ma ay helin.
See clearly.	Si cad u arag.
Someone has to really do it.	Qof waa inuu runtii sameeyaa.
I am for him	waxaan u ahay
I can't even find him.	Xitaa ma heli karo isaga.
He did a lot of good things.	Wax badan oo wanaagsan ayaa sameeyay.
I can talk	waan hadli karaa
good job !!.	shaqo wanaagsan!!.
And several more.	Iyo dhowr kale.
The closest a man can get.	Sida ugu dhow ee uu nin heli karo.
I found this	kan waan ka helay
That is not the case now.	Taasi hadda sidaas maaha.
You, you were not present.	Adiga, ma aadan joogin.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
They all still exist.	Dhammaan weli waa jiraan.
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax aad u weyn.
I did really well.	Runtii si fiican ayaan sameeyay.
Just work.	Kaliya shaqada.
It is a very difficult place.	Waa meel aad u dhib badan.
Surprisingly, it really is.	Waa yaab, runtii waa.
And became who he was.	Oo noqday kii uu ahaa.
But there you were lucky.	Laakiin halkaas ayaad nasiib ku lahayd.
You do not need to do this.	Uma baahnid inaad tan sameyso.
He is probably fine now.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu hadda fiican yahay.
It may be nothing.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan waxba ahayn.
He was very impressed.	Aad ayuu ula dhacay.
He knows how it is.	Wuu garanayaa sida ay taasi tahay.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, runtii.
He asked me why.	Waxa uu i waydiiyay sababta.
He would go there.	Halkaas ayuu aadi lahaa.
I enjoyed the work	Waan ka helay shaqada
I will not pay.	Ma bixin doono.
If they don't like us, that's fine.	Haddii aysan na jeclayn, taasi waa fiican tahay.
Maybe he was already there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hore u joogay.
Not you.	Adiga maaha.
so thought.	sidaas mooday.
Even if you don't see me, someone else does.	Xitaa haddii aadan i arag, qof kale arag.
You can take me	Aniga waad qaadan kartaa
He is likely to do so.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu sidaas sameeyo.
I didn't think so.	uma malaynayn.
Not already.	Mar hore maaha.
promise us now !.	hadda noo ballan!.
Much of this has been with me.	Wax badan oo ka mid ah tani waxay ahayd aniga.
Not surprisingly, each time a new one is better.	La yaab ma leh, mar kasta oo cusub ayaa ka sii fiican.
Someone else.	Qof kale.
There was nothing to do.	Wax la sameeyo ma jirin.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu tagay.
He knows very well.	Aad buu u yaqaan.
It's a bad thing.	Waa wax xun.
I know it will be fine.	Waan ogahay inay fiicnaan doonto.
She had to stay home.	Waxay ahayd inay guriga iska joogto.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
It's really interesting.	Dhab ahaantii waa wax xiiso leh.
He lied to me.	Been buu iga sheegay.
Like a familiar friend maybe.	Sida saaxiib la yaqaan ayaa laga yaabaa.
They may still be smarter than you.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay wali kaa caqli badan yihiin.
You can leave	Waad bixi kartaa
We were old friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo hore.
And certainly not now.	Oo hubaal hadda maaha.
Would it be better.	Ma ka fiicnaan lahayd.
He has another idea.	Waxa uu leeyahay fikrad kale.
He had no friends.	Ma lahayn saaxiib.
It was over now.	Waxay ahayd in ka badan hadda.
He took no chances.	Wax fursad ah ma uu qaadan.
That is not correct.	Taasi sax maaha.
That would be great.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa mid aad u wanaagsan.
It was not good.	Ma ahayn mid wanaagsan.
I did not speak.	Ma aan hadlin.
No one else can.	Qof kale ma awoodo.
That wasn’t a big deal.	Taasi wax weyn ma ahayn.
I still want to learn from you.	Weli waxaan rabaa inaan wax kaa barto.
You can't stay here	Halkan ma joogi kartid
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
But maybe somewhere else, too.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa in meel kale ay noqon karto, sidoo kale.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin aad u qurux badan.
If he would like to talk to someone other than me, that's fine.	Haddii uu jeclaan lahaa inuu la hadlo qof aan aniga ahayn, waa fiican tahay.
I had a job.	Waxaan lahaa shaqo.
Someone owns it.	Qof baa leh.
He knew what would happen.	Wuu ogaa waxa dhici doona.
This is really true.	Runtii tani waa run.
.	.
He wanted to.	Wuu rabay.
I would like to help you	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku caawiyo
He really didn’t come out.	Dhab ahaantii ma uusan soo bixin.
And not just a few.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya dhowr.
Very beautiful idea.	Fikrad aad u qurux badan.
Really, that's right.	Runtii, taasi waa sax.
Someone said that some time ago.	Qof ayaa sheegay in muddo ka hor.
I think, really, it was.	Waxaan u maleynayaa, runtii, inay ahayd.
It will happen.	Way dhici doontaa.
This is me.	Tani waa aniga aniga.
It looks like no one is home.	Waxay u egtahay inaan qofna guriga joogin.
He was there, here.	Wuu la joogay, halkan.
Now he really knew.	Hadda si dhab ah ayuu u ogaa.
Just from nothing.	Kaliya ka yimid waxba.
Not what you want.	Ma aha waxa aad rabto.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
It is an old problem.	Waa dhibaato hore.
I can't say much about him.	Wax badan uma sheegi karo isaga.
I saw.	waan arkay.
It won't hurt.	Waxba ka yeeli maayo.
Someone else did.	Qof kale ayaa sidaas sameeyay.
It is difficult to maintain.	Way adag tahay in la sii hayo.
It's a good day.	Waa maalin wanaagsan.
Take some food.	Qaado xoogaa cunto ah.
He was amazed.	Yaab buu noqday.
It’s really a little weird.	Runtii waa wax yar oo la yaab leh.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
I will do the same to you.	sidaas oo kale ayaan kuu samayn doonaa.
And it came at a bad time.	Oo wuxuu yimid waqti xun.
She should know now.	Waa inay hadda ogaato.
I am in it now.	hadda waan ku jiraa.
There were three of them.	Waxaa jiray saddex ka mid ah.
What will he do.	Muxuu samayn doonaa.
He is very happy about this.	Aad ayuu ugu faraxsan yahay arrintan.
This is what you have to do.	Tani waa waxa ay tahay inaad sameyso.
You would love him.	Waad jeclaan lahayd isaga.
Someone very smart.	Qof aad u caqli badan.
It will not stop.	Kuma joojin doono.
Do not pay anything.	Waxba ha ka bixin.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
No problem.	Wax dhibaato ah malaha.
I had no idea what had happened.	Wax fikrad ah kama helin waxa dhacay.
You were like that.	Waxaad ahayd sidaas.
What a new idea.	Waa maxay fikrad cusub.
They did not go to the right place.	Ma aysan tagin meel sax ah.
That was tough.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid adag.
You can do whatever you want.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
For me, exactly.	Aniga, si sax ah.
It was right there.	Waxay ahayd isla halkaas.
It will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doonto.
I need to know you better	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan si fiican kuu ogaado
Just a little, but it's a thing.	Kaliya wax yar, laakiin waa wax.
It wasn’t too bad.	Ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
That is not surprising.	Taasi la yaab maaha.
I'm sure it's nothing.	Waxaan hubaa inaysan waxba ahayn.
There are many unknowns.	Waxa jira waxyaabo badan oo aan la garanayn.
It was a few years ago.	Waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
But not as he did.	Laakiin ma aha sidii uu sameeyay.
I think that's hard for you.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi kugu adag tahay.
How interesting.	Sidee xiiso leh .
But something else is going on here.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa halkan ka socda.
He had never seen one like him.	Mid isaga la mid ah ma uu arag.
you did not see anything.	waxba ma aadan arag.
Otherwise it may not be so good.	Haddii kale ma laga yaabaa in si fiican.
She thinks it is invisible.	Waxay u malaynaysaa inay tahay mid aan la arki karin.
I do not love you.	kuma jecli.
You can't stay here	Halkan ma joogi kartid
Whatever it would be, would be.	Wax kasta oo noqon lahaa, noqon lahaa.
He really wants to help me.	Runtii wuxuu rabaa inuu i caawiyo.
But close enough.	Laakiin ku filan dhow.
I will stay here again	Mar kale ayaan sii joogi doonaa halkan
That’s what they like to do best.	Taasi waa waxa ay jecel yihiin inay sameeyaan sida ugu fiican.
He wants more.	Wax badan buu rabaa.
You can't leave.	Ma bixi kartid.
He knew he had to.	Wuu ogaa inay ahayd inuu haysto.
You did not receive any money.	Lacag ma aadan helin.
If so, great.	Haddii ay sidaas tahay, weyn.
She is happy.	Way ku faraxsan tahay.
It was constant.	Waxay ahayd mid joogto ah.
You are.	Wax aad tahay.
He’s out of it all.	Waa uu ka soo baxay oo dhan.
I'm a little afraid it might hurt.	Waxaan ka yara baqayaa inay wax yeeli karto.
who knows what.	yaa yaqaan waxa.
He will do it.	Wuu samayn doonaa.
I know that.	Waan ogahay taas.
I really know you can do it.	Runtii waan ogahay inaad samayn karto.
We are friends.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo.
Anyone but me.	Qof kasta oo aan aniga ahayn.
I would not do it.	Ma aan yeeli lahayn.
What he wants is small.	Waxa uu rabo waa yar yahay.
First, if he really was the former.	Markii hore, haddii uu runtii ahaa mid hore.
I gave him time.	Waqti ayaan siiyay.
It's the same for you.	Waa isku mid adiga.
It really was him.	Runtii waxay ahayd isaga.
I am very happy	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay
I have a hard time working properly.	Waqti adag ayaan ku hayaa inaan si sax ah u shaqeeyo.
Probably not everyone can.	Malaha qof walba ma awoodo.
That is true now more than ever.	Taasi waa run hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
That is a very good thing.	Taasi waa waxa aad u fiican.
So far, little is known about it.	Ilaa hadda, wax yar ayaa laga ogyahay.
Maybe he thought it was hard enough one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu u maleeyay inuu dhib ku filan yahay hal maalin.
Tomorrow is like today.	Berrito waa sida maanta oo kale.
That is what they need to do.	Taasi waa waxa ay u baahan yihiin inay sameeyaan.
We will find a place to go.	Waxaan ku heli doonaa meel aad aado.
Apparently he has already got one job.	Waxa cad in uu hal shaqo hore u helay.
Now it is every white person in prison.	Hadda waa qof kasta oo cad oo xabsiga ku jira.
They are very happy.	Aad bay u faraxsan yihiin.
But he refused.	Laakiin wuu diiday.
He enjoyed it a lot.	Wax badan ayuu ka helay.
After all, something is better than nothing.	Ka dib oo dhan, wax ayaa ka fiican waxba.
There are no problems so far.	Wax dhibaato ah ma jiraan ilaa hadda.
As he tried, he could not.	Inta uu isku dayay, wuu awoodi waayay.
A lot is going on here.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa halkan ka socda.
This is you.	Waa kan adiga.
Anyone can do anything.	Qof kastaa wuu samayn karaa wax kasta.
He was ready to come home.	Wuxuu diyaar u ahaa inuu guriga yimaado.
This is too much.	Tani waa mid aad u badan.
I have to work	Waa inaan shaqeeyo
It’s a great place, and you love it.	Waa meel aad u fiican, oo aad jeceshahay.
You can see how it is.	Waad arki kartaa sida ay tahay.
I think you know we have to do this.	Waxaan filayaa inaad ogtahay inay tahay inaan tan samayno.
For a while he said nothing.	In muddo ah waxba ma uu odhan.
It was uncertain.	Waxay ahayd hubaal la'aan.
I was even asked if he could help me.	Xitaa waxa la waydiiyay in uu i caawin karo iyo in kale.
I don't want to stay here.	Ma doonayo in aan halkan ku sii jiro.
For one, he is too tall to be beautiful.	Mid ka mid ah, waa uu aad u dheer yahay si uu u noqdo mid qurux badan.
That would be all.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd dhammaan.
But something else.	Laakiin wax kale.
I have no idea what it is.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo waxa ay tahay.
I want to do things	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo
There had to be something.	Waxay ahayd inay wax jiraan.
We cannot allow this.	Ma ogolaan karno tan.
Wherever she is.	Meel kasta oo ay joogto.
I'm sorry what? 	Waan ka xumahay maxaa?
she thinks.	waxay u malaynaysaa.
That is bad, but it is bad.	Taasi waa xun, laakiin waa xun tahay.
I will not go.	Ma tagi doono.
That is very small.	Taasi waa mid aad u yar.
In the same way as the rest.	Si la mid ah inta kale.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiro.
Tonight, that's not the case.	Caawa, sidaas maaha.
This is a little more complicated.	Tani way ka yara dhib badan tahay.
There is so much that is not known before.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo aan la garanayn ka hor.
It is not a job.	Ma aha shaqo.
Again very little.	Mar kale aad u yar.
It is permanent.	Waa joogto.
But he has been around a lot already.	Laakiin aad buu u sii joogay mar hore.
I stayed.	Waan iska joogay.
It may still exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli jiro.
Something happened to me.	Waxyaabo igu dhacay.
But it was tough.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid adag.
It is a strike	Waa shaqo joojin
I hope you like it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in aad jeceshahay.
He is fine	Wuu fiican yahay
He thinks so.	Waxa uu u malaynayaa.
There was.	Waxaa jiray.
He would be able to see.	Wuu awoodi lahaa inuu arko.
It didn’t have much of a truth.	Ma lahayn wax badan oo run ah.
You will get it.	Waad heli doontaa.
That was very clear.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u cad.
I'm not really sure what happened	Runtii ma hubo waxa dhacay
No one knew how to do it.	Qofna ma garanayn sida loo sameeyo.
I did.	waan sameeyay.
I had to find out quickly.	Waxa ay ahayd in aan si degdeg ah taas u ogaado.
He knew what he was going to see.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu arki doono.
It really is.	Waa runtii.
John has no idea why.	John wax fikrad ah kama haysto sababta.
No one should have known.	Qofna ma ahayn inuu ogaado.
I love the big one.	Waxaan jeclahay kan weyn.
I don't want any trouble to come.	Ma rabo in wax dhib ah u yimaado.
And certainly enough, now everyone has done it.	Oo hubaal ku filan, hadda qof kastaa wuu sameeyay.
Always three, clear.	Had iyo jeer saddex, cad.
Not now and never again.	Hadda ma aha oo mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
You can still do that.	Weli waad samayn kartaa taas.
It’s all a little weird.	Waa wax yar oo dhan.
I could not do otherwise.	Si kale ma yeeli karin.
Please tell me otherwise.	Fadlan ii sheeg haddii kale.
It's beautiful, this.	Waa qurux, tan.
I found something.	wax baan ku helay.
I really didn’t spend much time here.	Run ahaantii waqti badan kuma bixin halkan.
As you can see, it was beautiful.	Sida aad arki karto, waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
He said they included something new.	Waxa uu sheegay in wax cusub ay ku jiraan.
I really had no place.	Runtii meel uma haysan.
I would love to get to know you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan ku barto.
I really went for it.	Runtii waan u aaday.
It's hard there.	Way ku adag tahay halkaas.
I never got it.	Weligay maan helin.
All in all, great work.	Dhammaan, shaqo weyn.
I am really happy for him.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay isaga.
I really wanted to.	Aad ayaan u rabay.
Very beautiful, really.	Aad u qurux badan, dhab ahaantii.
I think they won't.	Waxaan filayaa in aanay yeeli doonin.
He was there even more than me.	Waxa uu joogay xitaa in ka badan aniga.
Here he would do something.	Halkan ayuu wax ka qaban lahaa.
It is also the best place to get out of here.	Sidoo kale waa meesha ugu fiican ee laga bixi karo halkan.
It would never happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici lahayd.
Everyone always wants more.	Qof kastaa mar walba wax badan buu rabaa.
Do not go back and forth.	Hor iyo dib ha u noqon.
You know he is.	Waad ogtahay inuu yahay.
But he is also very good at what he does.	Laakiin sidoo kale aad ayuu ugu fiican yahay waxa uu sameeyo.
You have a lot here.	Waxaad halkan wax badan.
This is not difficult.	Tani maaha mid adag.
That is,.	Taasi waa,.
She refused to do so.	Way diiday inay sidaas samayso.
I still owed you.	Weli waan ku lahaa.
I promised that.	Taas ayaan u ballan qaaday.
I can talk to you	waan kula hadli karaa
You can't go	Ma aadi kartid
.	.
I am always ready for him.	Mar walba isaga ayaan diyaar u ahay.
Quick! 	Degdeg ah!
fast! 	degdeg ah!
They had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inay sameeyaan.
There is something.	Waxaa jira wax.
I don't know where he is.	Ma garanayo meesha uu joogo.
I don’t have anything really good.	Ma haysto wax wanaagsan oo dhab ah.
I think she has.	Waxaan filayaa inay leedahay.
I think no one does.	Waxaan filayaa in qofna aanu samayn.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
There is nothing clearer.	Ma jiro wax ka cad cad.
Sure, it will help a bit.	Hubaal, waxay ku caawin doontaa xoogaa.
This is great.	Tani waa wax weyn.
And get it.	Oo ku heli.
I am the only one.	aniga kaliya ayaan ahay.
We live there.	Waxaan ku nool nahay halkaas.
He refused openly.	Wuu diiday si cad.
And a lot of time.	Iyo waqti badan.
I just want to do something else.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo wax kale.
He knows what is needed.	Waxa loo baahan yahay wuu garanayaa.
But now we need it.	Laakiin hadda waanu u baahanahay.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
I just decided that.	Kaliya taas ayaan go'aansaday.
This may not be what you want.	Tani ma noqon karto waxa aad rabto.
This is real.	Tani waa mid dhab ah.
This will be very close and close.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa wax aad u dhow oo dhow.
Very good here.	Aad u fiican halkan.
He seemed to hear.	Wuu u muuqday inuu maqlay.
I will be	waan ahaan doonaa
Can someone help me?	Qof ma i caawin karaa?.
What an interesting man.	Waa maxay nin xiiso leh.
Something else is needed.	Wax kale ayaa loo baahan yahay.
Pick one today.	Mid soo qaado maanta.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag mid la mid ah.
In fact, it was too much.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
It is ready.	Waa diyaar.
It was very quick from all over.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u degdeg badan oo dhan ka yimid.
so I made you.	sidaas ayaan kaa dhigay.
I lost that and more.	Taas iyo wax ka badan waan waayay.
Everyone else did.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa sameeyay.
I did not speak correctly.	Si sax ah uma aan hadlin.
That is a problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato.
I have no one.	Qofna ma hayo.
It was not something she could help.	Ma ahayn wax ay ku caawin karto.
He will be out again soon.	Mar kale dhawaan ayuu bixi doonaa.
He has to be there.	Waa inuu halkaas joogo.
I need you to do things	Waxaan u baahanahay inaad sameyso waxyaabo
I don't have time for this.	Waqti uma hayo kan.
That is all you need.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay.
You are not really sorry yet.	Runtii ma aad ka xumahay weli.
No one knows what they are.	Qofna ma garanayo waxay yihiin.
Now I like a lot of other things.	Hadda waxaan jeclahay waxyaabo badan oo kale.
He never said anything.	Waligiis waxba ma odhan jirin.
I left nothing.	Waxba kama tagin.
But they did not come.	Laakiin ma ay iman.
It was a car.	Waxa uu ahaa baabuur.
Everyone is happy and excited.	Qof kastaa wuu faraxsan yahay oo wuu faraxsan yahay.
It was hard work.	Waxay ahayd shaqo adag.
And it is not really the same.	Oo runtii isku mid ma aha.
It does nothing.	Waxba ma sameeyo.
It is not interesting, but it is new.	Ma aha wax xiiso leh, laakiin waa mid cusub.
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
It was so close.	Waxay ahayd sidaas u dhow.
I can't say what it is.	Ma sheegi karo waxa ay tahay.
That can give me but.	Taas way i siin kartaa laakiin.
But it can certainly be.	Laakiin hubaal way noqon kartaa.
This was not everything, but it was something.	Tani ma ahayn wax walba, laakiin waxay ahayd wax.
I will do everything	wax walba waan samayn doonaa
We will get as much as you want.	Waxaan heli doonaa inta aad rabto.
We are the same and the same.	Waxaan nahay isku mid iyo isku mid.
He felt it again.	Waxa uu dareemay mar kale.
Found a car.	Dib u helay baabuur.
he would return.	wuu soo noqon lahaa.
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
He did not.	Ma uu samayn.
Which really isn’t like me.	Taas oo runtii aan aniga oo kale ahayn.
That is great.	Taasi aad bay u weyn tahay.
There is always a lot to do.	Had iyo jeer waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo la sameeyo.
He went to the door.	Albaabka ayuu aaday.
Still not sure why.	Wali ma hubo sababta.
He did not want to be where he was.	Meesha uu joogo ma uu rabin.
Something for everyone, really.	Wax u ah qof walba, runtii.
I would love to do that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas sameeyo.
That was a long time ago.	Taasi waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
You know you want it.	Waad ogtahay inaad rabto.
It would probably help him work better.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ka caawin lahayd inuu si fiican u shaqeeyo.
One recently came out.	Mid dhawaan soo baxay.
It was not good.	Ma ahayn mid wanaagsan.
I don't want to do this tonight.	Ma doonayo inaan tan sameeyo caawa.
Now and again.	Hadda iyo mar kale .
But he is very good.	Laakiin aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I did that.	Taas waan sameeyay.
I felt something.	Wax baan dareemay.
That was great.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
You know, fast food.	Waad ogtahay, cunto degdeg ah.
That is really a lie.	Runtii taasi waa been.
It's nothing.	Waa waxba.
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
I will never go there again.	Mar dambe ma aadi doono halkaas.
I saw.	Waan arkay.
This is really bad.	Tani runtii aad bay u xun tahay.
That was denied.	Taas waa loo diiday.
There is something	Wax baa jira
There is nothing to talk about.	Wax laga hadlo ma jirto.
Now tell me something else.	Hadda wax kale ii sheeg.
I do not understand now.	Ma fahmin hadda.
He promised to stay with her.	Wuxuu ballan qaaday inuu la joogi doono.
Maybe it was just fun.	Malaha waxay ahayd xiiso kaliya.
Just don't say.	Kaliya ha odhan.
We probably don't do anything fast.	Waxa ay u badan tahay in aanu samayn wax degdeg ah.
No one else can.	Qof kale ma awoodo.
I do not love you.	kuma jecli.
If you have.	Haddii aad leedahay.
He will always be with us.	Mar walba wuu nala joogi doonaa.
He did what he always did.	Wuxuu sameeyay wuxuu had iyo jeer sameeyo.
Not me.	Ma aha aniga.
Not bad.	Wax xun maaha.
Maybe I should come back.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan soo noqdo.
That doesn't matter now.	Taasi hadda waxba maaha.
As he said.	Sida uu yiri.
Why.	Waa maxay sababta ay.
Anything more.	Wax kasta oo ka badan.
It's just.	Waxa kaliya.
They are all gone.	Waa la wada tagay.
You just wouldn't go.	Kaliya ma aadi lahayd.
It looks right.	Waxay u egtahay sax.
He is always with you.	Mar walba wuu kula joogaa.
He has been around for a long time.	Muddo dheer ayuu jiray.
There are other things as well.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo kale sidoo kale.
It may also be correct.	Waxa kale oo laga yaabaa inay sax tahay.
No one seems to have refused.	Qofna uma eka inuu diiday.
He already had.	Hore ayuu u lahaa.
He looked at it without hesitation.	Si aan dhib lahayn ayuu u eegay.
He really doesn’t like everyone.	Dhab ahaantii maaha mid jecel qof kasta.
Really, it was really a lot of work.	Runtii, runtii shaqo badan bay ahayd.
Go to school.	Aad dugsiga.
I am very happy, really.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay, runtii.
Everything he did was a problem.	Dhammaan waxa uu sameeyay waxay ahayd dhibaato.
I asked again why.	Mar kale ayaan waydiiyay sababta.
I want to see something done	Waxaan rabaa inaan arko wax la sameeyay
That is the bad guy.	Taasi waa qofka xun.
He started at the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka bilaabay.
There is no way out.	Ma jirto meel laga baxo.
She loves you very much.	Aad bay kuu jeceshahay.
And this would be true.	Oo tani run bay ahaan lahayd.
So far, no problem.	Ilaa hadda, dhib ma leh.
He may be able to find a job.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu awoodo inuu shaqo helo.
He would stay.	Wuu joogi lahaa.
Surprisingly, he was not someone he knew.	Yaab, ma ahayn qof uu yaqaan.
You can't do this.	Ma samayn kartid tan.
How great it is.	Sida ay u weyn tahay.
I looked at the house.	Waxaan eegay guriga.
It is not a lie.	Been maaha.
This is really what you did here.	Tani runtii waa waxa aad halkan ku samaysay.
I would not have kept him.	Maan sii haysan lahaa isaga.
For him, it could be.	Isaga, waxay noqon kartaa.
I wanted to talk to him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo.
There was just no one.	Kaliya qofna ma jirin.
That may not be a good idea he thought.	Taasi ma noqon karto fikrad fiican ayuu u maleeyay.
I think it's good.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiican tahay.
She just loves him.	Kaliya way jeceshahay isaga.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan.
Maybe even a little worse.	Waxaa laga yaabaa xitaa xoogaa si xun.
It is true and true.	Waa run iyo run.
In fact.	Dhab ahaantii .
Just a bit.	Kaliya xoogaa.
But it probably helps.	Laakiin waxay u badan tahay inay caawiso.
It is everywhere.	Waa meel walba.
Tried a lot.	Wax badan isku dayay.
He began to want to.	Wuxuu bilaabay inuu rabo.
I will get it.	Waan heli doonaa.
What you told me.	Waxa aad ii sheegtay.
Very good man.	Nin aad u fiican.
This can be great.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn.
I left quickly.	Degdeg ayaan uga baxay.
But, it should.	Laakiin, waa inay.
I don't have much.	Wax badan ma haysto.
It didn't cost me anything.	Waxba igama bixin.
There was so much here.	Waxaa jiray wax badan halkan.
It should not be allowed.	Waa inaan la ogolaan.
What came out is.	Waxa soo baxay waa .
I was not here	halkaan maan joogin
He wanted to know how it was.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado sida ay taasi tahay.
I should have told you.	Waxay ahayd inaan kuu sheego.
There is.	Waxaa jira .
Do not separate.	Ha kala tagin.
Maybe not even all day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aan xitaa maalin dhan.
But you seem to know that.	Laakiin waxay u egtahay inaad taas ogtahay.
I think it's the same for you.	Waxaan filayaa inay kula mid tahay.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma jiraan.
That's something that really matters to people.	Taasi waa wax runtii dadka wax ugu leh.
You were lucky today.	Nasiib baad lahayd maanta.
There was something else, too.	Wax kale ayaa jiray, sidoo kale.
I am not included in that.	Anigu taas kuma jiro.
After all.	Wax walba ka dib .
And he was here.	Oo halkan ayuu ahaa.
She didn't want this.	Ma ay rabin tan.
I don’t think more than him.	Uma maleynayo in ka badan isaga.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xun.
Don't even think about it.	Xitaa taas ha u malayn.
I really couldn't do anything.	Runtii waxba maan qaban karin.
I always did, after all.	Had iyo jeer waan sameyn jiray, ka dib.
It wasn't that they didn't like him.	Ma ahayn in aanay jeclayn isaga.
Another was launched.	Mid kale ayaa la bilaabay.
Which they do, a lot.	Taas oo ay sameeyaan, wax badan.
I was there recently, and a lot before.	Waxaan halkaas joogay dhawaan, iyo wax badan ka hor.
But you will find him.	Laakiin waad heli doontaa isaga.
I left with nothing.	Waxba waan la baxay.
Maybe he won't be here.	Malaha halkan ma joogi doono.
He liked this.	Wuu ka helay tan.
He knew better, now.	Si fiican buu u ogaa, hadda.
He may still be alive somewhere.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli nool yahay meel.
This was unbelievable.	Tani waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
She would stay.	Way joogi lahayd.
It was not an urgent task.	Ma ahayn shaqo degdeg ah.
I think they will be here now.	Waxaan filayaa inay halkan joogi doonaan hadda.
She would stay with him.	Way la joogi lahayd isaga.
But it will be better if you do not know.	Laakiin way ka fiicnaan doontaa inaadan ogayn.
Don't be an adult.	Ha noqon qof weyn.
Now there is nothing else to say.	Hadda wax kale oo la odhan karaa ma jiraan.
There is nothing new here.	Wax cusub halkan ma jiraan.
All in all it was great.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
I think that's a good thing.	Waxay ila tahay wax fiican.
I can't stay with you.	Kuma joogi karo adiga.
As mentioned earlier.	Sida hore loo sheegay.
Even if you don't have one yet.	Xitaa haddii aadan weli mid haysan.
More quickly.	In ka badan degdeg.
To find out more.	Si aad wax badan u ogaato.
This will be something that will take time.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa wax qaadan doona waqti.
Nothing more and nothing less, something taken and nothing found.	Wax ka badan iyo wax yar ma jiraan, wax la qaatay oo aan waxba laga helin.
He can do a lot.	Wax badan ayuu qaban karaa.
He would love it.	Aad buu u jeclaan lahaa.
I would stay here again.	Halkan mar kale ayaan joogi lahaa.
Here is what you have.	Waa kan waxa aad leedahay.
That would be nice even if there was nothing else.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd xitaa haddii aysan jirin wax kale.
Same for every man.	La mid ah nin kasta.
When everything is done.	Marka wax walba la sameeyo.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, run ahaantii maaha.
That is not a problem.	Taasi dhib maaha.
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
I decided to eat well and work.	Waxaan go'aansaday inaan si fiican u cuno oo aan u shaqeeyo.
I will do this	tan ayaan samayn doonaa
You were not there	Ma aadan jirin
Not a bad day job.	Ma aha shaqo maalin xun.
I say stop.	Waxaan ku leeyahay jooji.
I'm sure no one will do anything about it.	Waxaan hubaa in qofna uusan waxba ka qaban doonin.
He looked for a while.	Muddo ayuu eegay.
He still has something good.	Weli wax fiican buu hayaa.
It was an unimaginable place.	Waxay ahayd meel aan la malayn karin.
I had nowhere to go home.	Ma joogin meel aan guriga ku aado.
He looked more beautiful than before.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid ka qurux badan sidii hore.
One really long.	Mid runtii dheer.
But she realized she wasn't.	Laakiin way ogaatay in aanay ahayn.
They need me.	Way ii baahan yihiin.
There are many things you can do here.	Waxa jira waxyaabo badan oo aad halkan ku samayn karto.
Both are beautiful.	Labaduba way qurux badan yihiin.
After a long time.	Muddo dheer ka dib.
I have a lot on him.	Wax badan ayaan ku hayaa isaga.
But someone was.	Laakiin qof ayaa ahaa.
I do not get it.	Anigu ma helo.
I still don't know.	Wali ma garanayo.
He seemed happy.	Wax buu u muuqday mid ku faraxsan.
It is something other than that.	Waa wax aan taas ahayn.
I need to know he is fine.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado inuu fiican yahay.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
He should have known better.	Waxay ahayd inuu si fiican u ogaado.
You can get it all.	Waad heli kartaa dhammaan.
A smart man.	Nin caqli badan.
But, it will pay off.	Laakiin, way bixin doontaa.
It certainly looks like.	Waxaa hubaal ah inay u egtahay.
I'm sure he loves you.	Waan hubaa inuu ku jecel yahay.
Maybe it's better here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ka fiican tahay halkan.
It is always the same.	Had iyo jeer waa isku mid.
I want to learn from someone else.	Waxaan rabaa inaan qof kale wax ka barto.
Everything is close.	Wax walba waa u dhow yihiin.
New thing.	Wax cusub.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
Everyone knows everyone else.	Qof kastaa wuu yaqaan qof kasta oo kale.
It sounds like a great idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad weyn.
The whole door is a lot of work.	Albaabka oo dhan waa shaqo badan.
will not help you.	kuma caawin doonaan.
That doesn't seem too complicated.	Taasi uma eka mid aad u adag.
Food and plenty of food.	Cunto iyo cunto badan.
No one can find him.	Qofna ma heli karo isaga.
It's great.	Way weyn tahay.
He had no idea how to do it.	Ma uu lahayn fikrad sida uu sameeyo.
Not true.	Run maaha.
You didn't talk about it anymore.	Mar dambe ma aadan ka hadlin.
There is that.	Waxaa jira taas.
This is not correct	Tani sax maaha
You can tell me what you want from me.	Waxaad iga sheegi kartaa waxaad rabto aniga.
Don't stop doing something.	Ha u joojin inaad wax samayso.
That was rejected.	Taas waa la diiday.
I looked and looked, but did not find it.	Waan eegay oo eegay, laakiin ma helin.
There is.	Waxaa jira.
She didn't need anyone.	Cidna uma ay baahnayn.
In fact, it doesn’t work that way.	Dhab ahaantii, uma shaqeeyo sidaas.
But even that won’t be for a while.	Laakiin xitaa taasi ma ahaan doonto in muddo ah.
It’s also money, and work.	Sidoo kale waa lacag, iyo shaqada.
They are really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I could not otherwise.	Si kale maan awoodin.
I did it for you.	waan kuu sameeyay.
He was a great friend.	Wuxuu ahaa saaxiib weyn.
It's the worst.	Waa tan ugu xun.
I'm really scared.	Runtii waan ka baqayaa.
You can do more.	Wax badan ayaad samayn kartaa.
I am a bad person	waxaan ahay qof xun
.	.
He was a really good man.	Runtii nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
It is still a good place.	Wali waa meel fiican.
I didn't see anything.	Wax ma arag.
This was so much fun.	Tani waxay ahayd si aad u xiiso badan.
Until he was here.	Ilaa uu halkan joogay.
Who is with me?	Yaa ila socda?.
But not well.	Laakiin si fiican maaha.
I am everything to him.	Wax walba isaga ayaan u ahay.
Maybe not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan.
That's what we do.	Waa waxa aanu samayn.
And much more.	Iyo wax badan oo kale.
There is nothing else you can do here tonight.	Ma jiraan wax kale oo aad caawa halkan ku samayn karto.
It is no longer present.	Hadda ma joogto.
I saw that.	Waan arkay taas.
It wasn’t just.	Ma ahayn oo kaliya.
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
She would say so.	Waxay odhan lahayd sidaas.
There is so much to learn.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo halkaas ka jira in la barto.
If it weren't for him, someone like him would do it.	Haddii uusan isaga ahayn, qof isaga oo kale ah ayaa samayn lahaa.
I just want to get out of here.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan halkan ka baxo.
That is why you are here.	Waa sababta aad halkan u joogto.
In fact, you can stop.	Dhab ahaantii, waad joojin kartaa.
I should have done better.	Waxay ahayd inaan si ka wanaagsan sameeyo.
He stayed at the door.	Albaabka ayuu iska joogay.
Going.	U socda.
No one is here for that.	Ma jiro qof halkan galay taas.
He wanted to help, but he could not.	Wuxuu rabay inuu caawiyo, laakiin wuu awoodi waayay.
He felt troubled.	Waxa uu dareemay dhib.
There was something else as well.	Wax kale ayaa jiray sidoo kale.
it's a good thing.	waa wax fiican .
I just stayed there.	Halkaas ayaan iska joogay.
I'm happy to be here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo
She did not understand.	Ma ay fahmin.
He made that clear.	Taas ayuu si cad u sheegay.
There is nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiraan.
And do not be.	Oo la sameeyo in aan noqon.
That was nothing.	Taasi waxba ma ahayn.
Not that it was hard work.	Ma aha in ay ahayd shaqo adag.
He always saw it.	Mar walba wuu arki jiray.
We knew it would be.	Waan ogeyn inay noqon doonto.
I could not afford that.	Waan awoodi waayay taas.
Another went out.	Mid kale ayaa baxay.
It is very popular.	Waa wax aad loo jecel yahay.
I really liked him.	Aad ayaan uga helay isaga.
I want you like that.	sidaas oo kale ayaan kuu rabaa.
It’s a car, after all.	Waa baabuur, ka dib.
Please let everyone help.	Fadlan qof walba ha caawiyo.
This was a few years ago.	Tani waxay ahayd dhowr sano ka hor.
I know you are not.	Waan ogahay inaadan ahayn.
He was very talkative.	Aad buu u hadli jiray.
Time he does not have now.	Waqti uusan hadda haysan.
There was nothing right.	Wax sax ah ma jirin.
It's more than that.	Way ka sii badan tahay.
For a while no one came out.	In muddo ah cidna uma uu soo bixin.
He has to leave me.	Waa inuu iga tago.
I am very happy about this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
Maybe very little.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u yar.
Now, let me see.	Hadda, aan arko.
That should not be.	Taasi waa inaysan noqon.
Don't lie to me now.	Hadda been ha ii sheegin.
I would think.	Waxaan u malayn lahaa.
It was a good time.	Waxay ahayd waqti fiican.
And how well you did.	Iyo sida wanaagsan ee aad u samaysay.
No one can help me with this.	Qofna ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
Now it's even harder.	Hadda way ka sii adag tahay.
Everyone loves him.	Dadka oo dhan way jecel yihiin isaga.
She did everything she could to pay for it.	Waxay samaysay wax kasta oo ay ku bixin karto.
I think there is something to be seen here.	Waxaan filayaa inay jiraan wax halkan lagu arko.
I want it yesterday.	Waxaan rabaa shalay.
We can't find it	Ma heli karno
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax aan ka qaban karno.
What a man says is what he contains.	Nin waxa uu leeyahay waa waxa ku jira.
I didn’t want to do it.	Ma aanan rabin in aan sameeyo.
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
I was already there.	Hore ayaan u joogay.
And there is a time.	Oo waxaa jira waqti.
He could not.	Wuu awoodi waayay.
I can go anywhere	Meel kasta waan aadi karaa
There must be one !.	Waa in mid jiraa!.
He has performed very well here.	Si aad u wanaagsan ayuu halkan uga soo muuqday.
But no luck.	Laakiin nasiib ma leh.
Nothing major was seen.	Wax weyn oo la arkay ma jirin.
You know, like homework.	Waad ogtahay, sida shaqada guriga.
I just didn’t understand.	Kaliya ma fahmin.
He did this several times.	Tan dhowr jeer ayuu sameeyay.
Both are correct.	Labaduba waa sax.
Many of us are busy.	In badan oo naga mid ah mashquul.
He told us the same.	Wuxuu noo sheegay sidoo kale.
I think he knew.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ogaa.
In fact, very difficult.	Dhab ahaantii, aad u adag.
But he did not know what would happen now.	Laakiin ma uu garanayn waxa hadda dhici doona.
I took that from you.	Taas waan kaa qaaday.
I might as well go.	sidoo kale waa laga yaabaa inaan tago.
They will get better and they will get better.	Way fiicnaan doonaan oo way fiicnaan doonaan.
It was unbelievable.	Waxay ahayd wax aan la rumaysan karin.
But that will not do.	Laakiin taasi ma yeeli doonto.
That happened to you.	Taasi wax baa kugu dhacay.
Now you can find it anywhere.	Hadda waxaad ka heli kartaa meel kasta.
I liked it tonight.	Caawa waan ka helay.
That is as it may be.	Taasi waa sida laga yaabaa.
I know it exists.	Waan ogahay inay jirto.
Today will be another busy day.	Maanta waxay noqon doontaa maalin kale oo mashquul ah.
How very, very close.	Sidee aad iyo aad u dhow.
We loved him when he arrived.	Waanu jeclayn isaga markii uu yimid.
This was a problem.	Tani waxay ahayd wax dhib ah.
You can't stop.	Ma joojin kartid.
In fact, there was only one.	Dhab ahaantii, mid kaliya ayaa ahaa.
Only one minor problem.	Hal dhibaato yar oo kaliya.
I do not	ma samaynayo
She loves it here.	Way jeceshahay halkan.
It's a difficult place for you.	Waa meel kugu adag.
In fact, he did not even like to eat.	Dhab ahaantii, xitaa ma jeclayn inuu wax cuno.
I firmly have money.	Waxaan si adag u haysan lacag.
He is also a good friend.	Sidoo kale waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
It's lucky.	Waa nasiib.
In fact, there was little that could be said.	Runtii, waxaa jiray wax yar oo kale oo la sheegi karo.
You can keep that.	Waad sii haysan kartaa taas.
It was true.	Run bay ahayd.
I started to feel happy.	Waxaan bilaabay in aan ku faraxsanahay.
It was great.	Waxay ahayd mid weyn.
There were other things available.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo la heli karo.
It will take time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa wakhti.
I hope he comes.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu yimaado.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
They both love each other very much.	Labaduba aad bay u jecel yihiin.
I was a freshman out of prison.	Waxaan ahaa mid cusub oo ka baxay xabsiga.
But not a bad place, that is.	Laakiin maaha meel xun, taas.
It is all untrue.	Dhammaan waa wax aan run ahayn.
Not a small one.	Ma aha mid yar.
I do it sometimes.	Mar mar waan sameeyaa .
It had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
He told me how much it would be.	Inta ay noqon doonto ayuu ii sheegay.
But that is not all.	Laakiin halkaas kuma dhammaan doono.
I tried to find this beautiful.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo tan aad u qurux badan.
I can't leave anymore.	Mar dambe ma bixi karo.
He looked at me intently.	Aad buu ii soo eegay.
And you weren’t.	Oo ma aadan ahayn.
It was just right and correct.	Waxay ahayd kaliya sax iyo sax.
Better yesterday.	Mid ka wanaagsan shalay.
He had three friends.	Saddex saaxiib buu lahaa.
As before.	Sidii markii hore oo kale.
There was something here.	Wax baa jiray halkan.
The one who left.	Kii baxay.
If he wanted to, he could have it.	Haddii uu rabo wuu heli lahaa.
It was a little bad.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo xun.
Either way, it was awful.	Si kasta oo ay ahayd, waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
But I will definitely do it.	Laakiin hubaal waan sameyn doonaa.
I would definitely do it.	Hubaal waan yeeli lahaa.
That has enough.	Taasi waxay leedahay ku filan.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani sax maaha.
I will be fine.	Waan fiicnaan doonaa.
There is very little.	Waxaa jira wax aad u yar.
They are not always the same.	Had iyo jeer isku mid maaha.
He would be fine soon.	Dhawaan wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
It really looks good.	Runtii waxay u egtahay mid fiican.
It was too early to tell.	Waxay ahayd goor hore in la sheego.
What a wonderful place.	Waa maxay meel aad u la yaab leh.
I began to wonder why.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabay sababta.
No one gets everything.	Qofna wax walba ma helo.
Too much money.	Lacag aad u badan.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ma garanayo waxa aan ka sameeyo.
He would help as much as he could.	Wuu caawin lahaa waxa uu awoodo oo dhan.
Very close.	Aad u dhow.
Just tell me what's going on.	Kaliya ii sheeg waxa jira.
I'm happy to be here	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo
Yesterday, tomorrow, tonight.	Shalay, berri, caawa.
I will be with you	waan kula joogi doonaa
It should be known.	Waa in la yaqaan.
I love everyone at the same time.	Waxaan jeclahay dadka oo dhan isku mar.
I'm sorry.	Waan ka xumahay.
He had to leave quickly.	Waxay ahayd inuu degdeg u baxo.
Maybe he still does.	Malaha weli wuu sameeyaa.
It was taken.	Waa la qaaday.
He was not.	Ma uusan ahayn .
And as long as there is one available now.	Iyo inta uu jiro mid hadda la heli karo.
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax wanaagsan.
It could not be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karto.
tell me if you want.	ii sheeg haddii aad rabto.
Suffice it to say, it will be.	Ku filan ayaa la yidhi, waxa noqon doona.
Not if it can help.	Ma aha haddii ay caawin karto.
But you must.	Laakiin waa inaad.
He always had to be there.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd inuu halkaas joogo.
I can't imagine what made him.	Ma malayn karo waxa isaga ka dhigay.
I want to go tomorrow.	Waxaan rabaa inaan berrito tago.
Everyone is real.	Qof walba waa dhab.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
I'm sure you did the same.	Waxaan hubaa in aad samaysay wax la mid ah.
Ahaa, was, was.	Ahaa, ahaa, ahaa.
You did the right thing.	Waxaad samaysay sidii la rabay.
There is so much food.	Waxaa jira cunto aad u badan.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
No one came back.	Qofna dib uma soo noqon.
I like!!!.	waan jeclahay!!!.
I can stop	Waan joojin karaa
I wonder about you.	yaab baan kuu hayaa.
Everyone heard.	Qof kastaa wuu maqlay.
But that can be anything.	Laakiin taasi waxay noqon kartaa wax walba.
That was a bit lucky.	Taasi waxay ahayd xoogaa nasiib ah.
It can be difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
Do not say anything.	Waxba ha odhan.
You can't get it now.	Hadda ma heli kartid.
I will not return now.	Hadda soo noqon maayo.
I don't want to know.	Ma rabo inaan ogaado.
I am very happy to do this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan tan sameeyo.
You can't do anything here.	Halkan waxba kuma samayn kartid.
Just hard work.	Kaliya shaqo adag.
He is a friend.	Waa saaxiib.
I hope you can help me with this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad iga caawin karto arrintan.
For the most part, it wasn’t.	Inta badan, ma jirin.
I am so glad you told me.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaad ii sheegtay.
But just so good.	Laakiin kaliya aad u fiican.
This is not really a lie.	Tani run ahaantii been maaha.
Come now.	Hadda soo degdeg.
I am still happy to be at home.	Wali waan ku faraxsanahay inay guriga joogto.
I love you.	Waan ku jeclahay adiga.
If anything, he is happy with that.	Haddii ay wax jiraan, wuu ku faraxsan yahay taas.
In fact, it is the best thing he can do.	Dhab ahaantii, waa waxa ugu fiican ee uu sameeyo.
Maybe this was true.	Malaha tani run bay ahayd.
I didn't hear him.	Ma maqlay isaga.
Please let me help you.	Fadlan aan ku caawiyo.
It looks very interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
And really, you need me.	Oo runtii, waad ii baahan tahay.
This is not an old idea.	Tani maaha fikrad hore.
How amazing! 	Sidee la yaab leh!
Someone else may have done so.	Qof kale ayaa laga yaabaa inuu sidaas sameeyay.
Everything will be fine.	Wax walba waxay noqon doonaan si fiican.
He is not at home for long	Guriga in badan ma joogo
Less, one.	Ka yar, hal.
I was surprised she would even believe me.	Waxaan la yaabay inay xitaa i rumaysan doonto.
It can be very difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u dhib badan.
That would come.	Taasi way iman lahayd.
I want to make money	Waxaan rabaa inaan lacag sameeyo
There was no certainty here.	Ma jirin wax hubaal ah halkan.
He had food.	Cunto ayuu lahaa.
They are very, very small.	Aad iyo aad bay u yar yihiin.
I just started.	Hadda ayaan bilaabay.
Don't let them know.	Ha u ogolaan in aad ogaato.
If you don't like that, fine.	Haddii aadan taas jeclayn, fiican.
I think it would be better now.	Waxaan qabaa hadda inay fiicnaan lahayd.
I want to be surprised.	Waxaan rabaa inaan la yaabo.
I don't know why.	Ma garanayo sababta.
Maybe this is true.	Malaha tani waa run.
As you can see it was beautiful.	Sida aad arki karto waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
It will not end.	Ma dhammaan doono.
Not so much.	Ma aha sidaas u badan.
Maybe it's you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay tahay adiga.
It doesn't look pretty.	Uma eka mid qurux badan.
There was nothing beautiful here	Ma jirin wax qurux badan halkan
I think it's even more so.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay sidaas ka sii badan tahay.
It doesn't matter, really.	Waxba maaha, runtii.
It was me, all of me.	Waxay ahayd aniga, dhammaan aniga.
It probably is for sure.	Waxay u badan tahay inay hubaal tahay.
It’s so much more.	Waa wax aad u badan.
You are in me.	Adiga ayaa igu jira.
She realized it wasn't right.	Way ogaatay inaysan sax ahayn.
She had to.	Waxay ahayd inay.
No one has given it to me yet.	Mid wali cidna ima siin.
At first, they did not have him.	Marka hore, ma ay lahayn isaga.
But you need to know that.	Laakiin waxaad u baahan tahay inaad taas ogaato.
They do it clearly.	Waxay si cad u sameeyaan.
He knew he didn't need to say more.	Wuu ogaa in aanu u baahnayn in uu wax ka badan sheego.
It was also difficult.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd mid adag.
Let someone else do it.	Qof kale ha sameeyo.
Now he has heard us.	Hadda wuu naga maqlay.
It is really very small.	Runtii aad bay u yar tahay.
She probably already told him.	Waxay u badan tahay inay hore u sheegtay isaga.
I really don't understand.	Runtii ma fahmin.
There are still no problems.	Wax dhibaato ah wali ma jiraan.
This can help	Tani waxay ku caawin kartaa
They are very good.	Aad bay u fiican yihiin.
But one real thing.	Laakiin mid dhab ah.
He looks smart.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid caqli badan.
You are like him.	Waxaad tahay isaga oo kale.
Each of us did.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah ayuu sameeyay.
I hope for more things now.	Waxaan rajeynayaa waxyaabo badan hadda.
I even started.	Xitaa waan bilaabay.
She did more than he did.	Waxay samaysay wax ka badan inta uu sameeyay.
Just me.	Aniga kaliya.
I will be back soon	Mar kale ayaan joogi doonaa dhawaan
I had to work hard.	Waxay ahayd inaan si adag u shaqeeyo.
This is how it looks now.	Tani waa sida ay hadda u egtahay.
He had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma lahayn.
The rest is the same.	Inta kale waa sidaas oo kale.
It cannot be the only one.	Ma noqon karto tan kaliya.
He may do so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sidaas sameeyo.
Much more is coming.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa soo socda.
I could not do anything.	Waxba maan qaban karin.
I don't know anything.	Waxba ma garanayo.
Not here.	Ma jiro halkan.
Everything is too small.	Wax walba aad bay u yar yihiin.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
I quit my job	Waan ka tagay shaqada
He would say more.	Wax badan ayuu ka odhan lahaa.
We are working hard.	Waxaan nahay shaqo adag.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax aad yaab leh.
I have to go	Waa inaan aado
How beautiful she is.	Sidee u qurux badan tahay.
I'll tell you what it is.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa waxa ay tahay.
But there is more to be done here.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax ka badan oo halkan lagu sameeyo.
Not me, yet.	Aniga ma aha, weli.
Probably right.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sax tahay.
Soon, he would say, soon.	Dhawaan, wuxuu odhan lahaa, dhawaan.
You also do not need this regularly.	Sidoo kale uma baahnid tan si joogto ah.
He said nothing.	Waxba uma sheegin.
For a very long time.	Waqti aad u dheer.
We really are.	Runtii waan nahay.
This is the worst thing.	Tani waa waxa ugu xun.
This can be a one-off.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa hal mar.
How to do this ?.	Sidee loo sameeyaa tan?.
He had that.	Taas ayuu ku lahaa.
How can this be? 	Sidee tani noqon kartaa?
I have told you a lot.	In badan baan kuu sheegay.
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
He made it true.	Waxa uu ka dhigay mid run ah.
Everyone else did the same.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa sidaas oo kale sameeyay.
Now, just tell me.	Hadda, kaliya ii sheeg.
This is really bad.	Runtii tani waa mid xun.
Probably not much.	Malaha wax badan maaha.
This, hal.	Tani, hal.
Very good again.	Mar kale aad u fiican.
Ima yeeli kartid.	Ima yeeli kartid.
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
Do it right.	Si sax ah u qabo.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
He knows he will get it.	Wuu ogyahay inuu heli doono.
I still look beautiful.	Weli waxaan u muuqdaa mid qurux badan.
I felt good.	Waxaan dareemay fiicnaan.
I thought there was.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay jirto.
That will come in time.	Taasi waxay iman doontaa waqti.
I thought it would stay there.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay halkaas ka sii ahaan doonto.
She will find you.	Way ku heli doontaa.
It was a day.	Waxaan ahaa maalin.
That is why she knows everything.	Taasi waa sababta ay wax walba u ogtahay.
I have nothing to do.	Ma hayo waxaan sameeyo.
Now there is one.	Hadda mid buu joogaa.
There was no food.	Cunto ma jirin.
Nothing, but a little.	Waxba ma aha, laakiin wax yar.
I came out	Waan soo baxay
If you don't like something, stop doing it.	Haddii aadan wax jeclayn, jooji samaynta.
Which may be too much.	Taas oo laga yaabo inay aad ugu badan tahay.
It will not happen again, again.	Ma dhici doono, mar dambe, mar dambe.
I will not leave again.	Dib dambe uma bixi doono.
No one knows.	Qofna ma garanayo.
I wanted to say something else.	Waxaan rabay inaan wax kale sheego.
I will tell you all.	Waan kuu sheegi doonaa dhammaan.
What you did to me, what did you do.	Waxa aad igu samaysay, maxaad samaysay.
he wants that.	wuu rabaa sidaas.
It is instructive.	Waa wax laga barto.
I've seen this before.	Mar hore ayaan tan arkay.
Maybe not all.	Laga yaabaa in aan dhammaan.
A bit like that.	Xoogaa sidaas oo kale ah.
I am happy here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay halkan.
Like making money.	Sida lacag samaynta.
There is nothing they will not do for money.	Ma jiro wax aysan lacag ku samayn doonin.
But there was no time.	Laakiin waqti ma jirin.
Really, just don’t do it.	Runtii, kaliya ha samayn.
Sure, they love each other now.	Hubaal, hadda way is jecel yihiin.
I would give it to you.	waan ku siin lahaa.
That will not hurt you.	Taasi waxba kuma yeeli doonto.
Not true, but it is close.	Run ma aha, laakiin waa ku dhow.
There was no other option yet.	Weli ma jirin fursad kale.
I'm not sure why this is.	Ma hubo sababta tani u tahay.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
I will come to that.	Waan iman doonaa taas.
In fact, it is probably the best.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay u badan tahay inay tahay tan ugu fiican.
They did not return.	Dib uma ay noqon.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab yaab.
No problem.	Wax dhib ah ma leh.
you are new to it.	waxaad tahay qof ku cusub.
As it was for him.	Sidii ay isaga u ahayd.
He would go.	Wuu tagi lahaa.
I hope this helps someone.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay caawiso qof.
And maybe another one.	Iyo malaha mid kale.
I'm sure it can help you find out the rest.	Waxaan hubaa inuu kaa caawin karo inaad ogaato inta kale.
Me too.	Aniga sidoo kale.
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
In the same way everything is found.	Sida oo kale wax walba waa la helay.
A man at work.	Nin shaqada ku jira.
For you, this was great.	Adiga, tani waxay ahayd mid weyn.
Free, nothing.	Lacag la'aan, waxba.
Like, really, really happy.	Sida, runtii, runtii aad u faraxsan.
I found something interesting yesterday.	Waxaan helay shalay wax xiiso leh.
I'm happy	waan ku faraxsanahay
Someone did it for you.	Qof baa ku sameeyay.
Really good.	Dhab ahaantii aad u wanaagsan.
It also contains a clear area.	Waxa kale oo ku jira meel cad.
Maybe he was even one of them.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xitaa ka mid ahaa.
I wonder how much he did.	Waxaan la yaabanahay inta uu sameeyay.
Much has been said about it.	Wax badan ayaa laga sheegay.
I still didn't think anything.	Weli waxba uma malaynayn.
I would do it again.	Waan samayn lahaa mar kale.
I can help you do it.	Waan kaa caawin karaa inaad sameyso.
That’s great, that’s how it is.	Taasi waa wax weyn, waa sida ay tahay.
No one else does.	Qof kale ma sameeyo.
I can't get enough.	Ma heli karo wax ku filan.
You can't do anything wrong.	Wax xun ma aad samayn karin.
Not sure the rest.	Ma hubo inta kale.
I just want to get this.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan tan helo.
He can say strange things.	Waxyaabo yaab leh ayuu odhan karaa.
This is not an easy task.	Tani dhib yar maaha.
I do this regularly.	Si joogto ah ayaan tan u sameeyaa.
But it was all we could do.	Laakiin waxay ahayd waxa aan awoodi karno oo dhan.
But that is how things are.	Laakiin waa sida ay wax u jiraan.
I want to know.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado.
Ah, you are smart	Ah, caqli baad tahay
It just has to be done.	Waxa kaliya ee ay tahay in la sameeyo.
It wasn’t how bad it was.	Ma ahayn sida ay u xun tahay.
He asked what happened and started.	Waxa uu waydiiyay maxaa dhacay oo ku bilaabay.
You would do well for this.	Waxa aad tan ku fiicnaan lahayd.
And here was another opportunity.	Oo halkan waxay ahayd fursad kale.
Everyone in the room felt like me.	Qof kasta oo qolka ku jiray wuxuu dareemay sidii aniga oo kale.
So far it has not been successful.	Ilaa hadda kuma guulaysan.
I will not say anything.	Waxba odhan maayo.
You should not be here.	Waa inaadan halkan joogin.
I can go back on my own.	Waxaan ku noqon karaa aniga ahaan.
Something terrible happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
He is fine he told me.	Wuu fiican yahay ayuu ii sheegay.
They are very good friends.	Waa saaxiibo aad u fiican.
But it will come back to you.	Laakiin way kuu soo noqon doontaa.
I had a great time with that.	Waqti weyn ayaan ka helay taas.
She owned it there.	Halkaas bay iska lahayd.
He has one.	Mid buu leeyahay.
It is food.	Waa cunto.
I just wanted to go.	Kaliya waxaan rabay inaan tago.
And who might not like you.	Oo yaa laga yaabaa inuusan ku jeclayn.
Not much was found.	Wax badan oo la helay ma jirin.
They love him.	Way jecel yihiin isaga.
I know where he came from.	Waan ogahay meesha uu ka yimid.
He did not like it.	Ma uu jeclayn.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha .
Someone must have felt something.	Waa in qof wax dareemay.
They did not go.	Ma ay tagin.
Everything we do is free.	Wax kasta oo aan samayno waa lacag la'aan.
A little.	Wax yar.
Until not.	Ilaa aanay.
He did not want to go.	Ma uusan rabin inuu tago.
Bad man.	Nin xun.
Not much.	Wax badan ma jiraan.
Once a bad person, always a bad person.	Mar qof xun, mar walba qof xun.
He is very good at that.	Aad ayuu ugu fiican yahay taas.
I know you are a good man.	Waan ogahay inaad tahay nin wanaagsan.
But everything else is the same.	Laakiin wax kasta oo kale waa isku mid.
Whatever he wanted, he got.	Wax kasta oo uu rabay, wuu helay.
That's what he said.	Sidaas ayuu u sheegay.
Anyone can do it.	Qof kasta wuu samayn karaa.
It was probably hard work.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd shaqo adag.
I just want what is best for you	Kaliya waxaan rabaa waxa kuu fiican
He has not yet left	Wali ma bixin
I can still see	Wali waan arki karaa
I may not do this.	Tan waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan sameyn.
Good for the room.	Ku fiican qolka.
He was told.	Waa loo sheegay.
She does not want to go home.	Ma rabto in ay guriga aado.
But it is correct.	Laakiin waa sax.
I’m sure this was too.	Waxaan hubaa in tani ay sidoo kale ahayd.
I will pay	wax baan bixin doonaa
He did well, too.	Si fiican ayuu u sameeyay, sidoo kale.
I became interested.	Waxaan noqday mid xiiso leh.
But each other.	Laakiin mid kasta oo kale.
True and false.	Run iyo been.
I know who she is.	Waan garanayaa cidda ay tahay.
Always you.	Had iyo jeer adiga .
She didn't think so.	Ma ay malaynayn.
No one could find it.	Qofna ma heli karin.
You probably have one, too.	Waxay u badan tahay inaad mid leedahay, sidoo kale.
First, it is not.	Marka hore, sidaas maaha.
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
I wanted to talk to him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo.
I went out.	Waan la baxay.
But it will be over.	Laakiin aad bay u dhammaan doontaa.
There was something he said.	Wax uu yidhi baa jiray.
It was a bad time.	Waxay ahayd waqti xun.
It wasn’t just me.	Aniga kaliya ma ahayn.
They are certainly not friends.	Waa hubaal in aanay saaxiib la ahayn.
I'm sure it will continue to be so.	Waxaan hubaa inay sidaas ku sii ahaan doonto.
Maybe a friend.	Malaha saaxiib.
I bought it a long time ago.	Waxaan iibsaday wakhti dheer ka hor.
She didn't give a damn.	Waxba kama ay siin.
John entered.	John ayaa galay.
Now he could not leave.	Hadda wuu ka bixi waayay.
No one will help.	Qofna ma caawin doono.
Give your best to others.	Inta ugu fiican sii dadka kale.
A lot of no need for money.	Wax badan oo aan lacag u baahnayn.
I am not like that.	Anigu sidaas ma ihi.
He may have lied to us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu been noo sheegay.
I don't think he has anything to do with it.	Uma maleynayo inuu wax ka qabo.
It may be interesting.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay xiiso leedahay.
I would be very much there.	Aad ayaan halkaas ugu joogi lahaa.
He has to be there.	Waa inuu halkaas joogo.
I'm sure it will happen.	Waan hubaa inay dhici doonto.
This just doesn’t need me.	Tani kaliya maaha inay ii baahan tahay.
That will not be anything new.	Taasi ma noqon doonto wax cusub.
I'm really sorry.	Aad baan u xumahay runtii.
Here, you need to know someone.	Halkan, waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato qof.
It is also very much needed.	Waxa kale oo aad loo baahan yahay.
They are very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan yihiin.
Please do not be like that.	Fadlan sidaas ha noqon.
It is always one.	Had iyo jeer waa mid .
No one knows what to do.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa la sameeyo.
He could not find it.	Wuu heli waayay.
There was prison.	Waxaa jiray xabsiga.
Now he had.	Hadda oo uu lahaa.
Not that this was a surprise.	Ma aha in tani ay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
He is a bad person.	Waa qof xun.
It's still good, but it can be great.	Weli way fiican tahay, laakiin waxay noqon kartaa mid weyn.
I hope you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad.
almost.	wax ku dhow.
This is a bit more complicated.	Tani waa xoogaa ka adag.
They will not see me.	Ima arki doonaan.
He was tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag.
Nothing else.	Wax kale maaha.
It is also everywhere.	Sidoo kale waa meel walba.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
That would be nice.	Taasi way fiicnaan lahayd.
This is very, very bad.	Tani waa mid aad iyo aad u xun.
I hope someone can help me with this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof iga caawin karo arrintan.
I love home	Waxaan jeclahay guriga
He did.	Wuu sameeyay.
He wanted to get out of here.	Wuxuu rabay inuu halkan ka soo baxo.
This was too much.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u badan.
Probably it was.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd.
I asked him why he refused.	Waxaan waydiiyay sababta uu u sii diiday.
But it will not be.	Laakiin ma ahaan doono.
You are good at this.	Waad ku fiican tahay kan.
You are good.	Waad fiican tahay.
He certainly existed, but he could not see.	Waxaa hubaal ah inuu jiray, laakiin ma uu arki karin.
Good idea, that.	Fikrad wanaagsan, taas.
It was given to us.	Waa nala siiyay.
It was the only door in the room.	Waxay ahayd albaabka kaliya ee qolka.
He knows she wants him.	Wuu ogyahay inay isaga rabto.
Everything you need is ready.	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan tahay waa diyaar.
You know you do.	Waad ogtahay inaad sameyso.
I bought one	Mid baan iibsaday
Not yet correct.	Weli sax maaha.
It could not be.	Ma ay noqon karin.
There was not much.	Wax badan ma jirin.
It was amazing, really amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab, run ahaantii yaab leh.
I would love to see it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko.
She promised it would be a beautiful and clear day.	Waxay ballan qaaday inay noqon doonto maalin qurux badan oo cad.
And probably not long ago.	Oo waxay u badan tahay in aanay ahayn wakhti dheer ka hor.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
They are difficult.	Way adag yihiin.
It will allow you to do things that other people cannot do.	Waxay kuu ogolaan doontaa inaad sameyso waxyaabo aysan dadka kale sameyn karin.
He left.	Wuu tagay.
Very happy.	Aad u faraxsan.
This is a great time.	Tani waa waqti aad u fiican.
She really had it.	Runtii way ku lahayd.
I don't know what to expect.	Ma garanayo waxaan filan karo.
It can't hurt you	Waxba kuma yeeli karo
Something similar happened.	Wax la mid ah ayaa dhacay.
Otherwise we would not have left.	Haddii kale ma bixi lahayn.
I might as well.	Waxaan sidoo kale laga yaabaa.
He was very impressed.	Aad ayuu ula dhacay.
I never said that.	Weligay uma sheegin taas.
No more problems.	Dhib dambe ma jiro.
I don't know how much	Ma garanayo ilaa inta
But he did not like it.	Laakiin ma uu jeclayn.
An empty space.	Meel aan waxba ku jirin.
I still want it	Wali waxaan rabaa
That is a great thing.	Taasi waa wax weyn.
They will not pay much.	Wax badan ma bixin doonaan.
That is probably a good thing.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay wax wanaagsan.
I'm not feeling well.	Ma niyad qabo.
She always does.	Had iyo jeer way sameyso.
This was before.	Tani waxay ahayd ka hor.
I tried everything.	Wax walba waan isku dayay.
What a good time.	Maxaa waqti fiican.
It’s a lot of time.	Waa waqti aad u badan.
It still looks so beautiful.	Weli waxay u egtahay mid aad u qurux badan.
I still really do.	Weli runtii waan sameeyaa.
Now, that will do.	Hadda, taasi way sameyn doontaa.
But there is no such thing here.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax la mid ah halkan.
But she did not want that.	Laakiin taasi ma ay rabin.
He did more.	Wax ka badan ayuu sameeyay.
It's me right.	Waa aniga waa sax.
That was the only thing to do.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee la sameeyo.
And so it went.	Oo sidaas oo kale ayuu u baxay.
He said it might help.	Wuxuu sheegay in laga yaabo inay ku caawiso.
You can always leave	Mar walba waad iska tagi kartaa
You did well.	Si fiican ayaad u samaysay.
Good that you want me.	Ku fiican inaad i rabto.
I hope he did.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameeyay.
It was already.	Waxay hore u ahayd.
He wanted it again.	Mar kale ayuu rabay.
That wasn’t too bad.	Taasi ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
No one knew that.	Qofna taas ma ogayn.
He didn't even have a car.	Xitaa baabuur ma uu lahayn.
It could be tomorrow.	Waxay noqon kartaa berri.
I got enough of it	Waxaan helay wax igu filan
It was all he left behind.	Waxay ahayd waxa uu ka tagay oo dhan.
We'll get to that later.	Taas dib ayaan ka heli doonaa.
I can't stay here.	Halkan ma joogi karo.
I did not find that she did so.	Ma helin in ay sidaas samaysay.
Otherwise, it can be taken.	Haddii kale, waa la qaadan karaa.
Someone.	Qof ku .
.	.
Now you have me as a friend.	Hadda waxaad igu leedahay saaxiib.
And what not.	Iyo waxa aan ahayn.
Everyone started talking once.	Qof kastaa wuxuu bilaabay inuu hadlo hal mar.
Give this to yourself.	Sii tan ayuu is yidhi.
Don't tell me why.	Ha ii sheegin sababta.
Obviously, you are one.	Sida cad, waxaad tahay mid.
I don't think any of us would like that.	U malayn maayo in mid naga mid ah uu taas jeclaan lahaa.
There is always something missing.	Mar kasta waxaa jira wax aan la helin.
Give it to others.	Dadka kale sii.
He did not like what he saw.	Ma uu jeclayn waxa uu arkay.
But he found another reason.	Laakiin meel kale ayuu sababta ka helay.
But that was enough.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid ku filan.
She really had.	Runtii way lahayd.
I'm sure you will find something.	Waxaan hubaa inaad wax ka heli doonto.
He was right.	Sax buu ahaa.
It was originally taken.	Markii hore waa la qaaday.
.	.
We just do what we do.	Kaliya aan samayno waxaan samayno.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I have something better but I don’t get it.	Waxaan hayaa wax ka fiican laakiin ma helin.
You do not need.	Uma baahnid.
She can say whatever she wants.	Wax kasta oo ay rabto way sheegi kartaa.
There was no payment at all.	Ma jirin wax bixin ah oo dhan.
He really was.	Dhab buu ahaa.
I don’t know how he got it so quickly.	Ma garanayo sida uu degdeg ugu helay.
Now, he knew better.	Hadda, si fiican ayuu u ogaa.
There is nothing harder.	Wax ka adag ma jiro.
I will never tell you that.	Weligay taas u sheegi maayo.
Stop immediately.	Degdeg u jooji.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
You can't leave	Ma bixi kartid
Any of them.	Wax kasta oo ka mid ah.
But you, a lot.	Laakiin adiga, badan.
Good day!.	Maalin wanaagsan!.
I still have something else to say.	Weli wax kale oo aan u sheego ayaan hayaa.
It was everything.	Waxa ay ahayd wax walba.
Here is what to do	Waa kan waxa la sameeyo
That was just right.	Taasi waxay ahayd kaliya sax.
He looked back again.	Mar kale ayuu dib u soo noqday oo eegay.
I haven't done this in a while.	Tan ma samayn in muddo ah.
Mostly, smart.	Inta badan, caqli badan.
He was there for everything and everyone.	Wax walba iyo qof walba ayuu u joogay.
So much for that too.	Aad u badan oo sidoo kale.
It’s what he likes.	Waa waxa uu jecel yahay.
We are a lot more clear.	Waxaan nahay wax badan oo cad.
Somewhere, it would always happen.	Meel, had iyo jeer way dhici lahayd.
Not the least.	Ma aha inta ugu yar.
He was tough.	Wuxuu ahaa mid adag.
You should always be lucky.	Waa inaad mar walba nasiib leedahay.
He really loves you.	Runtii wuu ku jecel yahay.
I like a lot of things.	Waxyaabo badan ayaan jeclahay.
That is a very good job.	Taasi waa shaqo aad u fiican.
It looks like it was put somewhere else.	Waxay u egtahay in meel kale la dhigay.
It was near.	Waxay ahayd meel dhow.
It was not urgent.	Degdeg ma ahayn.
She was smart.	Waxay ahayd caqli badan.
He is a very good man.	Waa nin aad u fiican.
All is well.	Dhammaan waa fiican yihiin.
I'm sorry.	waan ka xumahay.
Most are still.	Inta badan waa weli.
I really like that.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay taas.
It took me.	Way iga qaaday.
I don't have to.	Ma aha inaan.
It was for this.	Waxay u ahayd tan.
Maybe more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka badan.
They will get something much better.	Waxay heli doonaan wax aad uga wanaagsan.
He fell behind.	Dib buu u dhacay.
We can't see him until tomorrow.	Ma arki karno isaga ilaa berri.
I am really happy about this.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
Can I tell? 	Ma u sheegi karaa?
It was a bad thing to do.	Waxa ay ahayd wax xun in la sameeyo.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
I really like it.	Runtii runtii waan jeclahay.
It is enough.	Way ku filan tahay.
He was well with it.	Si fiican ayuu ula joogay.
This should not be.	Tani waa inaysan noqon.
Everyone does this, even me.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa tan, xitaa aniga.
That’s a little surprising.	Taasi wax yar oo la yaab leh.
It was amazing and nothing.	Waxay ahayd yaab oo waxba ma ahayn.
Also, tell us why.	Sidoo kale, noo sheeg sababta.
I was not at work today.	Maan joogin shaqada maanta.
Maybe I should buy one	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan mid iibsado
I had no money	Lacag ma haysan
Can you be better	Ma ka fiicnaan kartaa
He was somewhere.	Meel buu joogay.
That would be.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd.
That would be a lot of work.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd shaqo aad u badan.
You once said that to me.	Mar ayaad sidaas igu tidhi.
He obviously knows.	Sida cad wuu garanayaa.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
There are no jobs applied for anywhere.	Ma jiraan wax shaqo ah oo meel walba ka codsaday.
I want to do this for you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan tan kuu sameeyo.
You can do anything.	Wax walba waad sameyn kartaa.
And very, very smart.	Oo aad iyo aad u caqli badan.
That is obvious.	Taasi waa wax iska cad.
A little busy here	Mashquul yar halkan
She had me.	Way i lahayd.
But really, they do.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii, way sameeyaan.
It is very clear.	Aad buu u cad yahay.
It is nothing new.	Wax cusub maaha.
Na na na.	Na na na na.
You can talk to me, you know.	Waad ila hadli kartaa, waad ogtahay.
Always.	Had iyo jeer.
It was acceptable.	Waxay ahayd mid la qaadan karo.
I do the same.	sidaas oo kale ayaan sameeyaa.
He thought he was smarter than others.	Wuxuu mooday inuu dadka kale ka caqli badan yahay.
He had to work a lot.	Waxa uu ahaa in uu shaqeeyo wax badan.
But it was enough.	Laakiin waxay ahayd mid ku filan.
Something everyone knew.	Wax qof walba ogaa.
He picked it up and looked at it.	Wuu soo qaaday oo eegay.
There is so much.	Wax badan ayaa jira.
But he is busy.	Laakiin waa mashquul.
I want to talk about it.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ka hadlo.
I can't stay in one place for long.	Ma joogi karo waqti dheer hal meel.
I haven't seen you in a while.	In yar kuma arag.
He is one man.	Waa hal nin.
Someone will do it.	Qof ayaa sameyn doona.
And other things, too.	Iyo waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
That was as it always has been.	Taasi waxay ahayd sida uu had iyo jeer ahaan lahaa.
Not only was it beautiful.	Ma ahayn oo kaliya inay qurux badan tahay.
I thought someone would stop, but three people rejected me.	Waxaan u maleeyay in qof joojin doono, laakiin saddex qof ayaa i diiday.
I can go to jail.	Waxaan aadi karaa xabsiga.
I didn't tell him.	Uma sheegin.
He can't do much more.	Wax badan oo kale ma uu qaban karo.
This is the least you can do.	Tani waa waxa ugu yar ee aad sameyn kartid.
You will be paid a lot of money.	Waxa lagu siin doonaa lacag badan.
Every one of me wants me to leave.	Mid kasta oo iga mid ah wuxuu rabaa inaan baxo.
You were not.	Ma aadan ahayn.
I did it first.	Waxaan sameeyay markii hore.
He got the job.	Waxa uu helay shaqada.
Just take as much as you can from everything.	Kaliya qaado inta ugu badan ee aad ka heli karto wax walba.
And see this.	Oo tan arag.
It was affordable.	Waxay ahayd mid la awoodi karo.
I need to have it.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan haysto.
I will give you that.	Waan ku siin doonaa taas.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
Not until she knows for sure.	Ma aha ilaa ay si hubaal ah u ogaato.
She really needs everything.	Waxay dhab ahaantii u baahan tahay wax walba.
Very, very, very much.	Aad iyo aad iyo aad u badan.
I may not have seen it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan arag.
I'm not sure it will help.	Ma hubo inay caawin doonto.
It is a problem for everyone.	Qof walba waa u dhib.
It was a long day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer.
It looks so cute and pretty.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u qurux badan oo qurux badan.
Nothing here.	Waxba halkan kuma jiraan.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
This may not be the case.	Tani waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
I didn't find anyone.	Qofna maan helin.
will not come	ma iman doono
Don't say.	Ha odhan.
This cannot be done.	Tani ma samayn karto.
I had to learn how to do that better.	Waxay ahayd inaan barto sida loo sameeyo taas si ka sii wanaagsan.
They will need more of him going forward.	Waxay u baahan doonaan wax badan isaga oo hore u socda.
That’s how it is, really.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay, runtii.
I am really sorry about this.	Runtii waan ka xumahay arrintan.
I wanted to talk to him.	Waxaan rabay inaan la hadlo.
He looked back at me.	Dib ayuu ii eegay.
I found the same.	Waxaan helay mid la mid ah.
Don't leave today.	Maanta ha bixin.
I will still help	Wali waan caawin doonaa
And now he says.	Oo hadda wuu yidhi.
I like it a lot.	Jeclahay in badan.
What did he know.	Muxuu ogaa.
It is what they do.	Waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
It can be good.	Way fiicnaan kartaa.
I'm pretty sure it's not real.	Waxaan aad u hubaa inaysan dhab ahayn.
Nala is not.	Nala ma aha.
I would always see.	Had iyo jeer waan arki lahaa.
That is not what we are.	Taasi maaha waxa aan nahay.
He must go today.	Waa inuu maanta tago.
This is the exit.	Tani waa meesha laga baxo.
I know everyone.	Waan ogahay qof walba.
The best he was here, really.	Sida ugu fiican ee uu halkan u joogay, dhab ahaantii.
I am at home having a good time	Waxaan guriga joogaa wakhti fiican
They do this for everyone.	Waxay sidaas u sameeyaan qof walba.
I know, it's hard.	Waan ogahay, way adag tahay.
You only need me tonight.	Caawa kaliya ayaad ii baahan tahay.
They did not.	Ma ay lahayn.
It is what you do.	Waa waxa aad samayso.
Definitely a man.	Dhab ahaantii nin.
Surely this cannot happen again.	Hubaal tani mar kale ma dhici karto.
It is enough for me.	Way igu filan tahay aniga.
You would love that.	Waad jeclaan lahayd taas.
I don't know enough.	Ma garanayo in ku filan.
It will definitely get better.	Runtii wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
Please let me know if you can speak.	Fadlan ii soo sheeg haddii aad hadli karto.
That is, that is beautiful.	Taasi waa, taasi waa qurux.
They are very clear.	Aad bay u cad yihiin.
This is the only controversy.	Tani waa waxa kaliya ee la isku hayo.
He really came back.	Runtii wuu soo noqday.
He told her he could not.	Wuxuu u sheegay inuusan awoodin.
And not so already.	Oo aan sidaas hore u ahayn.
The latter was very impressed.	Kan dambe aad buu ula dhacay.
She should be happy.	Waa inay faraxsan tahay.
I'm also sorry I didn't do anything.	Waxaan sidoo kale u xun nahay inaan waxba samayn.
He was very popular.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad loo yaqaan.
I have to go now.	Waa inaan hadda tago.
There was something else you said.	Wax kale oo aad sheegtay baa jiray.
That is also true.	Taasi sidoo kale waa sax.
In other words it is a lie.	Si kale haddii loo sheego waa been.
But we are the same.	Laakiin isku mid ayaan nahay.
I want a place here	Waxaan rabaa meel halkan
It really is.	Runtii waa dhab.
I will not lie.	Been sheegi maayo.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin sidaas maaha.
he would take.	wuu qaadan lahaa.
And not now, always.	Oo hadda maaha, mar walba.
I could not take solid food.	Maan qaadan karin cunto adag.
He wanted to get a job, he said.	Wuxuu rabay inuu shaqo helo, ayuu yiri.
It is made of.	Waa laga sameeyay.
we will do well	si fiican ayaan u qaban doonaa
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
Just so here.	Kaliya sidaas halkan.
Which you may want to know.	Taas oo laga yaabo inaad rabto inaad ogaato.
Here, there was only one.	Halkan, waxaa jiray hal kaliya.
I have never done anything.	Weligay waxba maan samayn.
It looks like that.	Waxay u egtahay sidaas.
Correct him.	Isaga sax.
He needs a new one.	Mid cusub ayuu u baahan yahay.
Not a big deal.	Wax weyn maaha.
It's too big.	Aad buu u weyn yahay.
I know the best room.	Waan ogahay qolka ugu fiican.
Now no problem.	Hadda wax dhib ah ma leh.
He never really talked to me.	Waligiis si dhab ah igama uusan hadlin.
I don't want to do anything else.	Ma doonayo inaan wax kale sameeyo.
But they are very true.	Laakiin aad bay run u yihiin.
No one was.	Qofna ma ahayn.
It is not time.	Ma aha waqti.
I have to do it	waa inaan sameeyo
He has an idea.	Waxa uu leeyahay fikrad.
I know very little.	Wax yar ayaan garanayaa.
All were rejected.	Dhammaan waa la diiday.
This, too, was unnecessary.	Tani, sidoo kale, waxay ahayd mid aan loo baahnayn.
Sorry, great man.	Waan ka xumahay, nin weyn.
However it may take.	Si kasta oo ay taasi qaadan karto.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
She should have known about this.	Waxay ahayd in ay arrintan ogaato.
He will do it.	Wuu samayn doonaa.
Whatever she wants.	Wax kasta oo ay rabto.
I hope you do the same.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad sidaas oo kale sameyso.
I will never leave now.	Weligay ma bixi doono hadda.
Not bad.	Wax xun maaha.
That was not done.	Taas lama samayn.
It's good, it's very good.	Way fiican tahay, aad bay u fiican tahay.
He has to talk to her.	Waa in uu la hadlo.
I have always been the best.	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa kan ugu fiican.
I know you were a good friend.	Waan ogahay inaad ahayd saaxiib wanaagsan.
You do not need that.	Uma baahnid taas.
He looked at me, hard.	Wuu iga eegay, si adag.
I didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inaan.
It is not present	Ma joogto
Just started this.	Kaliya tan ku bilaabay.
But it can be.	Laakiin way noqon kartaa.
He was a great man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin isla weyn.
He should still be able to tell me.	Waa inuu weli ii sheegi karaa.
That is true.	Taas oo run ah.
Not just a friend, but a friend.	Kaliya maaha saaxiib, laakiin saaxiib.
There can be no better man.	Ma dhici karto nin ka fiican.
Good people included.	Dadka wanaagsan waxaa ka mid ahaa.
It really isn’t that fast.	Runtii ma aha mid degdeg ah.
He wanted me to talk to him.	Wuxuu rabay inaan la hadlo.
But this may not always be a good thing.	Laakiin tani mar walba ma noqon karto wax wanaagsan.
No one saw it.	Cidna ma arag.
He is with me every day.	Maalin walba wuu ila joogaa.
I did not know.	Maan ogayn.
Good job.	Shaqo wanaagsan.
An unloved person.	Qof aan la jeclayn.
He did as much as he wanted to do.	Waxa uu sameeyay inta uu rabo in uu sameeyo.
They should still be a bit tough.	Waa inay weli xoogaa adag yihiin.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
Three days.	Saddex maalin.
That is how it is here.	Taasi waa sida ay halkan tahay.
But there is a lot to that.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo taas ah.
It was time to leave here.	Waxay ahayd markii halkan laga bixi lahaa.
He really wants this.	Runtii tan wuu rabaa.
He was one man.	Hal nin buu ahaa.
He promised not to come.	Waxa uu ballan qaaday in aanu iman.
No one can do it.	Wax qofna ma samayn karo.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
Can you come and help please.	Ma iman kartaa oo caawin kartaa fadlan.
I think it will come to us soon.	Waxaan filayaa inay dhawaan noo iman doonto.
I had.	aniga ayaa lahaa.
She actually said it more than once.	Waxay dhab ahaantii tidhi in ka badan hal mar.
But it really is, really.	Laakiin runtii waa, dhab ahaantii.
He is one man.	Waa hal nin.
There is a place for everyone.	Dhammaan waxaa jira meel.
I'm sorry to tell you that.	Waan ka xumahay inaan taas kuu sheego.
You can do whatever you like.	Waxaad ku samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
I do not know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo.
I got it.	Waxaan helay.
There is no problem with that.	Wax dhib ah kuma jiro taas.
He will come here soon to find me.	Dhawaan ayuu halkan iman doonaa si uu i helo.
He was really right.	Runtii sax buu ahaa.
She needs more than she can give you.	Waxay u baahan tahay wax ka badan inta uu ku siin karo.
You must really love us.	Runtii waa inaad na jeceshahay.
That is a more difficult problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato ka sii adag.
She can't do it.	Ma yeeli karto isaga.
He is better now.	Hadda wuu ka fiican yahay.
He went back.	Dib ayuu u baxay.
You really have.	Runtii waad leedahay.
In fact, it is small.	Dhab ahaantii, waa wax yar.
It's you, really.	Waa adiga, runtii.
As if they weren't really there.	Sida in aanay run ahaantii halkaas joogin.
But it is true what you have.	Laakiin waa run waxa aad leedahay.
you are a great man.	nin weyn baad tahay.
What can he do?	Muxuu qaban karaa.
We don't do it anymore.	Mar dambe ma samayno.
This was very close.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.	Malaha waa wax iska dhacay.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
very little of that.	aad buu u yar yahay taas.
That is how it is.	Taasi waa sida ay tahay.
What happened to me.	Maxaa igu dhacay.
A smart man.	Nin caqli badan.
I want you to say nothing.	Waxaan kaa rabaa inaadan waxba sheegin.
It's out of me.	Waa iga soo baxay.
We can't do it	Ma samayn karno
Like a big problem.	Sida dhib weyn.
This was smart.	Tani waxay ahayd mid caqli badan.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
It's a little difficult.	Waa uu yara adag yahay.
He refused '.	Wuu diiday'.
We give you.	Waxaan ku siin.
They may be very good.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay aad u wanaagsan yihiin.
Both are great !.	Labaduba aad bay u fiican yihiin!.
Maybe we won't.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan yeeli doonin.
You are a bad thing.	Wax xun baad tahay.
Everyone else is expected to come to you.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa la filayaa inuu kuu yimaado.
But he later refused.	Laakiin markii dambe wuu diiday.
This is very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad u adag.
I thought you would like to know.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad jeclaan lahayd inaad ogaato.
You do not need	Uma baahnid
Something terrible happened.	Waxyaabo aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
I don’t want to do too much about this.	Ma rabo inaan wax badan ka sameeyo tan.
Still, I didn't come.	Weli, ma iman.
That certainly did.	Taasi hubaal way samaysay.
It's true, really.	Waa run, dhab ahaantii.
That could be.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa.
This is the main reason.	Tani waa sababta ugu weyn.
One and the same.	Mid iyo isku mid.
But it does not work properly.	Laakiin si sax ah uma shaqeeyo.
There is a lot of new stuff.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo cusub.
I really still do.	Runtii wali waan sameeyaa.
He didn't take much.	Wax badan ma uu qaadan jirin.
Now why are you here.	Hadda sababta aad halkan u joogto.
Surprisingly bad.	Si la yaab leh ayaa xun.
And now everything is correct.	Oo hadda wax walba waa sax.
But it can be.	Laakiin way noqon kartaa.
I still want things.	Weli waxaan rabaa waxyaabo.
But that is not for me.	Laakiin taasi aniga maaha.
It was after he thought.	Waxay ahayd ka dib markii uu u maleeyay.
No one spoke to me about him.	Qofna igama hadlin isaga.
It would have been nice to see myself before.	Waxaa fiicnaan lahayd in aan is arko ka hor.
No one has found it yet.	Qofna weli ma helin.
We will see that both are false.	Waanu arki doonaa inay labaduba been yihiin.
Everything can be done.	Wax walba waa laga samayn karaa.
I'm sorry about this	tan waan ka xumahay
That is not who we are.	Taasi maaha cidda aan nahay.
No one is sure.	Qofna ma hubo.
He heard it several times.	Dhowr jeer ayuu ka maqlay.
You don't just have to make money.	Kaliya maaha inaad lacag sameyso.
I would like to stay	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan joogo
I got paid	Waxaan helay lacag
That is not a thing.	Taasi maaha wax.
I think it will happen, but it will take time.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay dhici doonto, laakiin waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
But little is known and they will not say.	Laakiin in yar baa la yaqaan oo ma sheegi doonaan.
That is not always true.	Taasi run mar walba ma aha.
But that was very small.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
John told him.	Yooxanaa wuu u sheegtay isaga.
It is very long, but it is very good.	Aad bay u dheer tahay, laakiin aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
I really wouldn’t do it.	Dhab ahaantii ma samayn lahaa.
I love him for who he is and what he is.	Waxaan isaga u jeclahay qofka iyo waxa uu yahay.
He shouldn’t have to pay much, not now.	Waa inuusan wax badan bixin, hadda maaha.
It is known.	Waa la yaqaan.
I will not see.	Ma arki doono.
Here to find out what happened	Halkan si aad u ogaato waxa dhacay
You are one of them.	Waxaad ka mid tahay.
What did he say.	Muxuu yidhi.
He did not come.	Ma uusan iman.
As often.	Sida inta badan.
I need a bit at a time.	Waxaan u baahanahay xoogaa hal mar.
But, it is still a new idea.	Laakiin, weli waa fikrad cusub.
He was really popular.	Runtii wuxuu ahaa mid la jecel yahay.
He already had.	Mar hore ayuu lahaa .
What a job.	Waa maxay shaqo.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba ma aha.
I don't know anymore.	Ma garanayo mar dambe.
It was so beautiful there.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u qurux badan halkaas.
Maybe he promised not to tell anyone.	Malaha wuxuu ballan qaaday in aanu cidna u sheegin.
He looked very hard.	Si aad ah ayuu u eegay.
He started as before.	Sidii hore ayuu u bilaabay.
Maybe he won't.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan yeeli doonin.
He never did.	Waligiis ma samayn.
He must have told him.	Waa inuu u sheegay.
I went there.	Halkaas ayaan aaday.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
You can talk to me	Waa la ila hadli karaa
But there is something else you need to do.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax kale oo aad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso.
That should not be done.	Taasi waa in aan la samayn.
I didn't think he could.	Uma malaynayn inuu awoodo.
It is enough.	Waa ku filan tahay.
That would happen.	Taas oo kale ayaa dhici lahayd.
It was just more than that.	Kaliya waxay ahayd wax ka badan tan.
She has friends.	Waxay leedahay saaxiibo.
Like you and me.	Aniga iyo adiga oo kale.
But only first.	Laakiin kaliya marka hore.
You do not have to say anything.	Ma aha inaad wax sheegto.
This is not small, it is great.	Tani ma yara, way weyn tahay.
There really is.	Waxaa jira si dhab ah.
Don't do too much now.	Hadda wax badan ha samayn.
There is no charge.	Lacag kuma jirto.
It's great.	Waa mid weyn.
Don't bother.	Dhibaato ha samayn.
Now you can see.	Hadda waad arki kartaa.
Nothing was known.	Ma jirin wax la yaqaan.
I can help a lot	Wax badan baan caawin karaa
The most difficult.	Tan ugu adag.
There is no real truth now.	Run dhab ah hadda ma jirto.
It was really hard at first.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad u adag marka hore.
Very fast, but not today.	Aad u degdeg badan, laakiin maanta maaha.
I hope someone can help me with this.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof iga caawin karo arrintan.
And certainly not you.	Oo hubaal adiga maaha.
He took a chance on me.	Fursad ayuu iga qaatay.
You can get it now.	Waad heli kartaa hadda.
That is very good.	Taasi waa ah aad u fiican.
It's not over yet.	Weli ma dhammaan.
Tell them more.	Wax badan u sheeg.
But that is not him.	Laakiin taasi isaga ma aha.
That is the only thing you need to do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee aad u baahan tahay inaad sameyso.
You just need to be there.	Kaliya waxaad u baahan tahay inaad halkaas joogto.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u fiican tahay.
Do you think so?	Ma waxaad u malaynaysaa ma aha?.
You can only be yourself.	Waxaad noqon kartaa kaliya adiga.
I hope you will do that.	Waxaan filayaa inaad taas samayn doonto.
No harm will come to him.	Wax dhib ah uma iman doono isaga.
Something very bad has happened.	Wax aad u xun ayaa sidaas dhigay.
This will not do.	Tani ma yeeli doonto.
He just didn't want to.	Kaliya ma uu rabin.
Everyone was ready.	Qof walba diyaar buu ahaa.
Can you do better?	Wax ka wanaagsan ma samayn kartaa?.
No one saw it.	Qofna ma arag.
There’s not much going on here.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo halkan ka socda.
Not much.	Ma aha wax badan.
Greater and better things to come.	Waxyaabo ka weyn oo ka wanaagsan soo socda.
I always want more.	Mar walba wax badan ayaan rabaa.
Three are gone.	Saddex ayaa meesha ka baxay.
I can't be him.	Kuma noqon karo isaga.
Not much time.	Ma aha waqti badan.
It is very real.	Aad bay u dhab tahay.
Today was a lucky day.	Maanta waxay ahayd maalin nasiib badan.
You can do this here.	Waxaad sidaas ku samayn kartaa halkan.
Very good, he said.	Aad u fiican, ayuu yidhi.
They are close to home	Waxay ku dhow yihiin guriga
He may not know they exist.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan ogeyn inay jiraan.
How to do it.	Sidii uu yeeli lahaa.
Everything is new.	Wax walba waa cusub yihiin.
I don't think you are younger.	U malayn maayo in kaa yar.
he could not stop.	wuu joojin waayay.
I've seen it a lot here.	In badan ayaan halkan ku arki jiray.
He would stay today.	Maanta wuu joogi lahaa.
Only what happened is unknown.	Kaliya waxa ku dhacay lama garanayo.
I did.	Waan sameeyay.
Something happened.	Wax baa ka dhacay.
But it was a good place.	Laakiin waxay ahayd meel fiican.
Otherwise it is not very common.	Haddii kale aad uma badna.
There is nowhere to go.	Meel la aado ma jirto.
I started to see why.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan arko sababta.
Something needs to be done.	Wax u baahan in la sameeyo.
I was also on time.	Waxaan sidoo kale ahaa waqti.
Whatever happened to him, someone made it.	Wax kasta oo ku dhacay isaga, qof ayaa ka dhigay.
But there is no big problem.	Laakiin ma jirto dhibaato weyn.
I tried to find it.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo.
I have never seen this.	Weligay tan ma arag.
Tell them what.	Ay ku sheeg maxaa.
It was also fun to do.	Waxa kale oo ay ahayd mid xiiso leh in la sameeyo.
He could not leave.	Waa uu bixi waayay.
He knew they would see it.	Wuu ogaa inay arki doonaan.
Until he told her.	Ilaa uu u sheegay.
I just don’t know what that is.	Kaliya ma garanayo waxa taasi ay tahay.
Not too long, really.	Ma aad u dheer, runtii.
But everyone says you did.	Laakiin qof kastaa wuxuu leeyahay waad samaysay.
Glad I did.	Ku faraxsanahay inaan sameeyo.
But much bigger.	Laakiin aad uga weyn.
I just can't do it.	Kaliya ma samayn karo.
He used to do that all the time.	Taas wuu samayn jiray mar kasta.
I had a really good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican runtii.
Everything is one.	Wax walba waa mid.
That should not be misunderstood.	Taasi waa in aan la fahmin.
But it was done.	Laakiin waa la sameeyay.
For the most part, it’s the latter.	Inta badan, waa kan dambe.
He could not get that.	Taas wuu heli waayay.
A little bit of this, a bit of that.	In yar oo ka mid ah tan, xoogaa taas.
There was no visible place.	Ma jirin meel la arki karo.
I had a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay.
I love food	Waxaan jeclahay cunto
There is nothing new about that.	Ma jiro wax ku cusub taas.
I have to know that you are a good person.	Waa inaan ogaado inaad tahay qof wanaagsan.
But me.	Laakiin aniga .
It is very good.	Aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
Viewed now.	Waa la eegay hadda.
He should have told her now.	Waxay ahayd inuu hadda u sheego.
I will always believe that.	Had iyo jeer waan rumaysan doonaa taas.
You did the right thing.	Waxaad samaysay wax sax ah.
This was nothing new.	Tani ma ahayn wax cusub.
Everyone knows something.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa wax.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
You are always happy.	Waad faraxsan tahay mar walba.
Both are certainly not the same.	Labaduba hubaal isku mid maaha.
Ah, so it is, says one.	Ah, marka waa sidaas, ayuu mid ka mid ah yidhi.
You are very good at it.	Aad baad ugu fiican tahay.
I really made it to him.	Runtii waan ka dhigay isaga.
But that can be a good thing.	Laakiin taasi waxay noqon kartaa wax wanaagsan.
You know, there’s not much to say, really.	Waad ogtahay, ma jiraan wax badan oo la sheego, runtii.
Where he has become.	Halka uu noqday .
Not too early.	Ma aha goor hore.
Everyone was something.	Qof walba wax buu ahaa.
I am not very familiar with this.	Ma ihi mid aad u yaqaan tan.
As it was with me.	Sidii ay aniga ila ahayd.
And so on and so forth.	Iyo wixii la mid ah iyo wixii la mid ah.
He tried to speak.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu hadlo.
There was a lot of trouble.	Dhib badan baa dhacay.
You can't see it here.	Halkan kama arki kartid.
I love you do	Waan ku jeclahay inaad sameyso
He left	Wuu ka baxay
He was once more beautiful than before.	Wuxuu ahaa mar ka qurux badan sidii hore.
Give me what you owe me.	I sii waxa aad igu leedahay.
It looks like nothing.	Waxay u egtahay waxba.
I think he is good at this.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu ku fiican yahay kan.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga aniga.
That is a bad thing.	Taasi waa wax xun.
He is one of the best.	Waa mid ka mid ah dadka ugu fiican.
Little has been said.	Wax yar baa la yidhi.
But it's not a big deal.	Laakiin ma aha wax weyn.
It was great.	Wax weyn buu ahaa.
For a while now.	In muddo ah hadda.
Tell them something.	Wax u sheeg.
I want someone to tell me what to do.	Waxaan rabaa in qof ii sheego waxaan sameeyo.
Not him.	Isaga maaha.
Friend, close friend.	Saaxiib, saaxiib dhow.
Now I'm not sure.	Hadda ma hubo.
That’s what we do, just bigger.	Taasi waa waxa aan samayno, kaliya ka weyn.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
It was a little beautiful.	Waxay ahayd wax yar oo qurux badan.
That wasn’t too big.	Taasi ma ahayn mid aad u weyn.
That's right.	Waa sax .
But you will stay and they will stay.	Laakiin waad joogi doontaa oo way joogi doonaan.
No one can help.	Qofna ma caawin karaa.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kuma eka.
That sounds like everything we can do.	Taasi waxay u egtahay wax walba oo aan sameyn karno.
He said he did not know.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanu garanayn.
He didn't want me to tell you.	Ma uu rabin in aan kuu sheego.
Please give me a better idea.	Fadlan i sii fikrad ka wanaagsan.
I was there yesterday.	Shalay ayaan joogay.
you are right	sax baad tahay
Interestingly, that’s what we have to do again.	Waxa xiiso leh, taasi waa waxa ay tahay in aan mar kale samayno.
Everything is clear.	Wax walba waa cad cad.
Says it looks bad.	Ayaa sheegay in ay u egtahay mid xun.
He did it one day.	Maalin ayuu sameeyay.
She has done this now.	Waxay samaysay tan hadda.
It’s a lot going on.	Waa wax aad u badan oo socda.
You are still new to this.	Wali waad ku cusub tahay kan.
It will be any time now.	Wuu ahaan doonaa wakhti kasta hadda.
Now he believes.	Hadda wuu rumaysan yahay.
I am a man.	Waxaan ahay nin.
If you are lucky, you are fine.	Haddii aad nasiib leedahay, waad fiican tahay.
As if it were nothing.	Sida haddii aanay waxba ahayn.
You at all times.	Adiga waqti kasta.
This is not always the case.	Tani mar walba sidaas maaha.
That sounds like a lot of work that I love.	Taasi waxay u egtahay shaqo aad u badan oo aan jeclahay.
I really don't understand this very well.	Runtii tan si fiican uma fahmin.
There are several.	Waxaa jira dhowr.
More time.	Waqti badan.
I was there.	Halkaas ayaan u joogay.
It was bad.	Wax xun bay ahayd.
He did not want to do that.	Ma uu doonayn inuu taas sameeyo.
Give me a little.	Wax yar i sii .
I would not say.	Ma odhan lahaa.
No one goes there.	Qofna halkaas ma tago.
He was a very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u fiican.
This was a good thing.	Tani waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan.
He thought he would come back now.	Wuxuu mooday inuu hadda soo noqon doono.
That didn't take long.	Taasi waqti badan ma qaadan.
If he still wants me.	Haddii uu weli i rabo.
He could not leave.	Waa uu ka bixi waayay.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
Also,.	Sidoo kale, .
No other cars were seen.	Ma jirin baabuur kale oo la arkay.
And something else would be.	Oo wax kale ayaa noqon lahaa.
He said so.	Sidaas buu lahaa.
That was not the same for me.	Taasi aniga ila mid ma ahayn.
She said I will get it.	Waxay tidhi waan heli doonaa.
I wish you would see.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad arki lahayd.
In fact, he was impressed.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu la dhacay.
I don't want him to do that.	Ma doonayo inuu taas sameeyo.
Will I take it ?.	Ma qaadan doonaa?.
I would tell the truth.	Run baan sheegi lahaa.
That will no longer be the case.	Taasi mar dambe ma sii ahaan doonto.
I would go there again	Mar kale ayaan aadi lahaa halkaas
Just the doorbell.	Kaliya albaabka albaabka.
That he never understood.	In uusan waligiis fahmin.
He got a lot.	Wax badan buu helay.
When everyone was busy he said.	Markii qof walba uu mashquul ku ahaa ayuu yiri.
Maybe you can get it.	Malaha waad heli kartaa.
I refused to do that.	Waan diiday inaan taas sameeyo.
A little similar.	Wax yar oo la mid ah.
I love it so much.	Aad baan u jeclahay.
I haven't seen him much.	In badan ma arag isaga.
Something they are not wise to do.	Wax aanay caqli u lahayn inay sameeyaan.
I was fine.	Waan fiicnaan jiray.
He knows what I need.	Wuu ogyahay waxa aan u baahanahay.
It would be really nice.	Runtii way fiicnaan lahayd.
You really don’t want to do that.	Runtii ma rabto inaad taas samayso.
It really is something they love to do.	Run ahaantii waa wax ay jecel yihiin inay sameeyaan.
Don't do it.	Ha qaban.
I love it when he does that.	Waan jeclahay marka uu taas sameeyo.
A really hard place.	Meel adag oo dhab ah.
Love me more.	Aniga iga jecel.
I don't know if you know that or not.	Ma garanayo inaad taas ogtahay iyo in kale.
Don't think you can't do it.	Ha u malayn inaadan samayn karin.
We will stay here if you need anything.	Waanu joogi doonaa halkan haddii aad wax u baahan tahay.
But very beautiful.	Laakiin aad u qurux badan.
No one does that.	Qofna taas ma sameeyo.
Everything is fine.	Wax walba waa fiican yihiin.
Maybe it was him.	Malaha isaga ayuu ahaa.
we will see	waan arki doonaa
I'm glad you're here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkan joogto.
No one knew what was going on.	Qofna ma ogayn waxa jira.
No one can.	Qofna ma awoodo.
He didn't have to know everything.	Ma aha in uu wax walba ka ogaa.
He's a smart guy, and maybe a good one.	Waa nin caqli badan, oo malaha mid fiican.
You may not	Ma laga yaabaa inaadan
If you want to.	Haddii aad rabto in aad.
The content is the same.	Waxa ku jira waa isku mid.
He did the right thing.	Waxa uu sameeyay wax sax ah.
It is really good.	Runtii aad bay u wanaagsan tahay.
Do not allow it to be eaten.	Ha u ogolaan in la cuno.
I am still happy.	Weli waan ku faraxsanahay.
She was right.	Sax bay ahayd.
They are very difficult.	Aad bay u adag yihiin.
He is not a bad man.	Nin xun maaha.
You will find the best here.	Waxaad ka heli doontaa kan ugu fiican halkan.
No one does that.	Qofna sidaas uma sameeyo.
She promised she would be fine.	Waxay ballan qaaday inay fiicnaan doonto.
I left here	halkaan waan ka baxay
Like everyone else, he knew.	Sida dadka kale, wuu ogaa.
Better than she thought.	Si ka fiican sidii ay u malayn lahayd.
There is so much.	Wax badan ayaa jira.
I just want to be happy.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ku faraxsanahay.
Then everyone with him.	Ka dib qof kasta oo isaga la jira.
I got this better	Tan ayaan ka helay si ka wanaagsan
It was a good day today.	Waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan maanta.
He loves this.	Waxa uu jecel yahay kan.
He told us so.	Wuxuu noo sheegay sidaas.
Let him see you.	Ha ku arko.
It will be a few surprises.	Waxay noqon doontaa yaab dhowr ah.
It was enough time.	Waxay ahayd waqti ku filan.
He made me go to school.	Wuxuu iga dhigay inaan aado dugsiga.
Now it seemed more than ever.	Hadda waxaa u muuqday in ka badan sidii hore.
Why no one thinks this will happen.	Waa maxay sababta qofna uma maleynayo in tani ay dhici doonto.
I can't imagine.	Ma malayn karo.
He was not far away.	Meel dheer ma uu joogin.
He was a man.	Nin buu ahaa.
The new job will pay good money.	Shaqada cusub waxay bixin doontaa lacag fiican.
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
Less is better.	Ka yar ayaa ka fiican.
I don't want to tell him what to do.	Ma rabo inaan u sheego waxa aan sameeyo.
It may still be.	Wali waa laga yaabaa.
I will not tell anyone else what to do.	Qof kale uma sheegi doono waxa la sameeyo.
I was a little surprised.	Waan yara yaabay.
I don't want it anymore	Mar dambe ma rabo
I really got it.	Runtii waan helay.
It is again.	Waa mar kale.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
I do not love you.	kuma jecli.
I wish it was not so.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaysan sidaas ahayn.
The bigger, the better.	Ka weyn, ayaa ka wanaagsan.
But maybe he told me.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inuu ii sheegay.
I want to be real.	Waxaan rabaa in aan dhab noqdo.
There is so much to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo.
He had never seen anything before.	Hadda ka hor waxba ma uu arag.
I think they do.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inay sameeyaan.
He told her.	Wuxuu u sheegay.
This is much obvious.	Tani wax badan ayaa iska cad.
He will be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan doonaa.
That needs to be spread.	Taasi waxay u baahan tahay in la kala qaado.
He did other things, too.	Waxa uu sameeyay waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
We may not be too busy.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan aad mashquul u ahayn.
Often this is not the case.	Inta badan taasi maaha.
He is just a friend.	Waa saaxiib kaliya.
It can be a real problem.	Waxay noqon kartaa dhibaato dhab ah.
I got enough.	Waxaan helay wax ku filan.
It's a made-up problem.	Waa dhibaato la sameeyay.
John, to leave.	John, inuu baxo.
you are a bad man.	nin xun baad tahay.
Still, it was amazing.	Weli, waxay ahayd yaab.
I really can't.	Runtii ma awoodo.
Maybe it's good for him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay isaga u fiican tahay.
They need it.	Waxay u baahan yihiin.
They gave nothing.	Waxba ma ay siin.
Really, really not.	Runtii, runtii maaha.
More than me.	In badan iga dheer.
What is done is done.	Waxa la sameeyo waa la sameeyaa.
There is so much beauty in it.	Qurux badan baa ku jira.
This is going to be great.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
It's so beautiful.	Waa wax aad u qurux badan.
No one knew much about him.	Qofna wax badan kama ogayn isaga.
She will succeed.	Way guulaysan doontaa.
It can't be anything else.	Wax kale ma noqon karto.
You have to do better.	Waa inaad taas wax ka fiican samayso.
You will be very beautiful.	Waxaad noqon doontaa mid aad u qurux badan.
And to buy it from here.	Iyo in aan halkan ka soo iibsado.
Maybe it was him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu isaga ahaa.
You should not.	Ma ahayn inaad.
Including the rest.	Oo ay ku jiraan inta kale.
But it can also be very interesting.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Definitely more true.	Dhab ahaan ka run badan.
Now he is surprised.	Hadda wuu yaabay.
I just know what it is now.	Kaliya waan ogahay waxa ay tahay hadda.
Often, the cause is unknown.	Inta badan, sababta lama garanayo.
It is this now.	Waa tan hadda.
He is always sure of me.	Had iyo jeer wuu ila hubaa.
I think he is back in prison.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu xabsiga ku soo noqday.
I always liked that.	Mar walba taas waan ka helay.
You will win.	Waad guulaysan doontaa.
And no car.	Oo aan baabuur lahayn.
I am very busy	Aad ayaan mashquul u ahay
Nothing great, but not too bad.	Ma jiraan wax weyn, laakiin ma aha mid aad u xun.
But it is also, much more.	Laakiin sidoo kale waa, wax ka badan.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
This is all for me.	Tani waa aniga oo dhan.
You shouldn't do it, but you can't help it.	Waa inaadan samayn, laakiin ma caawin kartid.
He knew you.	Wuu ku ogaa.
It was a great time indeed.	Waxay ahayd waqti aad u weyn runtii.
And very good.	Oo aad u fiican.
Maybe he reviewed everything.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax walba dib u eegay.
That’s how good they are.	Taasi waa sida ay u fiican yihiin.
it is you.	adiga ayaa ah.
And a day later.	Iyo maalin ka dib.
It was good for her.	Wax wanaagsan bay u lahayd.
That is why it is good.	Taasi waa sababta ay u wanaagsan tahay.
We will talk.	Waan wada hadli doonaa.
Like tomorrow it would be great.	Sida berri oo kale way fiicnaan lahayd.
This is no small feat.	Tani maaha wax yar.
You know, it will be interesting.	Waad ogtahay, waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
It would never come out again.	Mar dambe ma ay soo bixi lahayd.
I could not	Anigu ma aan awoodin
Maybe they will.	Malaha way yeeli doonaan.
No one wants to see that.	Qofna ma rabo inuu taas arko.
She will love me.	Way i jeclaan doontaa.
This is something to be believed.	Tani waa waxyaabo la rumaysan karo.
He left.	Wuu ka tagay.
I returned home.	Waxaan ku noqday guriga.
I need to do something.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan wax sameeyo.
I can't do it there	Ma samayn karo halkaas
Well done really.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay runtii.
He is in a good place.	Meel wanaagsan ayuu joogaa.
Most of the time, take your time.	Inta badan, waqti qaado.
There are several men who love it.	Waxaa jira dhowr nin oo jecel.
I put it in a big place.	meel weyn baan dhigay.
No one can see you here.	Qofna kuma arki karo halkan.
I will be here for a while.	Waxaan halkaan joogi doonaa in muddo ah.
He went there.	Halkaas ayuu aaday.
There must be something out there.	Waa in ay jiraan wax halkaas ka jira.
You can tell me.	Waad ii sheegi kartaa.
Too much chance.	Si aad u badan fursad.
I think she even likes you a little.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay xitaa ku jeceshahay in yar.
You all people.	Adiga dadka oo dhan.
The rest can't.	Inta kale ma awoodo.
Who is younger than him.	Yaa isaga ka yar.
We love him.	Waanu jeclayn isaga.
It is now every day.	Hadda waa maalin kasta.
But you can do something.	Laakiin wax baad samayn kartaa.
He was a very good man.	Wuxuu ahaa nin aad u wanaagsan.
I can't help it.	Ma caawin karo.
He asked for help.	Waxa uu codsaday in la caawiyo.
More to come !.	Wax badan oo la socda!.
But that will also be a favorite of everyone.	Laakiin taasi waxay sidoo kale noqon doontaa mid qof walba jecel yahay.
He did not come alone.	Keligiis ma iman.
not that.	ma taas .
It would be nice to stay for a while.	Way fiicnaan lahayd inaad wax yar sii joogto.
He told me exactly what he wanted me to do.	Wuxuu ii sheegay si sax ah waxa uu rabo inaan sameeyo.
Adam, good day !.	Aadan, maalin wanaagsan!.
I don’t like any of that.	Anigu mid ka mid ah ma jecla taas.
You told him.	Waad u sheegtay.
It is so.	Waa sidaas oo kale.
I didn't think so.	Uma malaynayn.
Beautiful, he said sincerely.	Qurux, ayuu si niyad ah u yidhi.
When he returned he came out to me.	Markii uu soo noqday ayuu ii soo baxay.
He was very surprised.	Aad buu ula yaabay.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
He looked younger than me.	Wuxuu ii muuqday mid iga yar.
I don't understand very well.	Aad uma fahmin.
But not after everything else.	Laakiin ma aha ka dib wax kasta oo kale.
But now.	Laakiin hadda.
Surprised.	La yaabay.
It was everything.	Waxay ahayd wax walba.
But him.	Laakiin isaga.
But why would you do that?	Laakiin maxaad sidaas u samayn lahayd?.
You did not take time.	Ma aadan waqti u qaadan.
I wanted to tell everyone tonight.	Waxaan rabay inaan qof walba u sheego caawa.
It was beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan.
Everyone else is smarter.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa ka caqli badan.
They will do whatever is needed.	Waxay samayn doonaan wax kasta oo loo baahan yahay.
You are good there	Waad ku fiican tahay halkaas
He wanted to get out of here.	Wuxuu rabay inuu halkan ka baxo.
He must still be close.	Waa inuu weli u dhow yahay.
He had to keep it somewhere.	Waxay ahayd inuu meel ku hayo.
I am really happy to be here.	Runtii aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
I would do that.	Waxaan qaban lahaa waxa.
I can do as you need.	Waxaan samayn karaa sida aad u baahan tahay.
I never got that.	Weligay sidaas uma helin.
There is nothing greater than that.	Ma jiro wax ka badan oo wax ka weyn ma jiraan.
Probably one.	Mid ka mid ah malaha.
Maybe not, you know.	Ma laga yaabaa inaadan, waad ogtahay.
I just tried.	Kaliya waan isku dayay.
you are amazing !!!!!.	yaab baad tahay!!!!!.
I've seen it before.	Halkan hore ayaan ugu arkay.
I didn't like school	Maan jeclayn dugsiga
I may not be able to help myself.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaanan is caawin karin.
That's what he does now.	Waa waxa uu hadda sameeyo.
This is very interesting.	Tani waa mid aad u xiiso badan.
I can't do this now.	Hadda maan samayn karin tan.
I want to tell you.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kuu sheego.
I doubt something will come out of it.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay wax ka soo bixi doonaan.
I could not let him see me.	Waan u ogolaan waayay inuu i arko.
Tomorrow I can't.	Berri ma awoodo.
To be with you.	In aan kula joogo.
She is like me.	Aniga waxay ila mid tahay .
It was hard, very hard.	Waxay ahayd mid adag, aad u adag.
Please help me.	Fadlan ii caawin .
But he never came back.	Laakiin mar dambe ma soo noqon.
Maybe he came.	Malaha wuu yimid.
They did not get enough money for this.	Ma aysan helin lacag ku filan tan.
Each of us said what we do.	Mid kasta oo naga mid ah waxa uu yidhi waxa aan samayno.
Well done.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
I really like it	Runtii waan jeclahay
He said something great.	Wax weyn buu yidhi.
I didn't find anyone to talk to.	Qof aan la hadlo maan helin.
He came to help.	Wuxuu u yimid inuu caawiyo.
Really awful place !.	Runtii meel aad u xun!.
He was still.	Weli wuu ahaa.
That alone will not be.	Kaliya taasi ma noqon doonto.
It will not do.	Ma yeeli doonto.
Also, it had to be abandoned.	Sidoo kale, waxay ahayd in laga tago.
He is at the door.	Albaabka ayuu joogaa.
This is a minor problem.	Tani waa dhib yar.
It’s like, right, this is work.	Waxay la mid tahay, sax, tani waa shaqo.
But it is always so.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waa sidaas.
Everything is new to me.	Wax walba waa igu cusub yihiin.
He saw.	Wuu arkay.
An unknown place from now on.	Meel aan la garanayn hadda ka dib.
I really didn't talk.	Runtii lama hadlin.
This is all you do.	Tani waa waxa aad sameyso oo dhan.
They really are.	Runtii way yihiin.
It can only be paid in advance.	Waxa kaliya oo hore loo bixin karaa.
It's great, no problem.	Way weyn tahay, dhib malaha.
That is tomorrow.	Taasi waa berri.
Every day now.	Maalin kasta hadda.
It's him.	Waa isaga.
What was that? 	Maxay ahayd taasi?
Up to three years.	Ilaa saddex sano.
He did something about it.	Wax buu ku sameeyay.
Ah! 	Ah!
Maybe he did.	Malaha wuu sameeyay.
I think it will be very beautiful.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay noqon doonto mid aad u qurux badan.
You will see that it is correct.	Waxaad arki doontaa inay sax tahay.
I can still do it now.	Weli waan samayn karaa hadda.
Much earlier.	In badan oo hore.
That's how it feels to me.	Taasi waa sida ay aniga ila tahay.
I am right now.	run baan ahay hadda.
I also thought she liked me.	Waxaan sidoo kale u maleeyay inay i jeceshahay.
I wanted to	waan rabay
I will not go home.	Guriga ma aadi doono.
Enough for you ?.	Kugu filan adiga?.
Even if you do not yet know.	Xitaa haddii aadan weli ogeyn.
That's right, but not all.	Waa sax, laakiin ma wada aha.
He should have known now.	Waxay ahayd inuu hadda ogaado.
He told me to find a new friend.	Waxa uu ii sheegay in aan helo saaxiib cusub.
There was one.	Mid baa jiray.
It's weird but weird.	Waa yaab laakiin yaab leh.
I knew it really well.	Runtii si fiican ayaan u ogaa.
In fact, he was.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu ahaa.
It was all great here.	Waxay ahayd wax weyn oo dhan halkan.
It was not a bad job.	Ma ahayn shaqo xun.
She did not want to be with him.	Ma rabin inay la joogto.
It is real.	Waa dhab.
He had a job.	Shaqo ayuu lahaa.
Give to people.	Dadka wax sii.
Obviously, something happened.	Sida cad, wax ayaa dhacay.
It was known.	Waa la ogaa.
But there are other things, too.	Laakiin waxaa jira waxyaabo kale, sidoo kale.
Now you can do it	Hadda waad samayn kartaa
I don't like that.	Anigu ma jecli taas.
As you like.	Sida aad jeceshahay.
This was great.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
There was no other problem.	Dhib kale ma jirin.
Everything else is unnecessary.	Wax kasta oo kale waa wax aan loo baahnayn.
He would do it if he could.	Wuu ka yeeli lahaa haddii uu awoodo.
Today is not a good day.	Maanta maalin wanaagsan maaha.
Maybe it was too late.	Malaha waxay ahayd goor dambe.
I want someone to come home.	Waxaan rabaa qof inuu guriga u yimaado.
did not see	ma arag
But he still did not understand.	Laakiin weli ma uu fahmin.
Made again, same.	Mar kale sameeyay, isku mid.
You will love it.	Aad ayaad u jeclaan doontaa.
You know how hard it is and really amazing.	Waad ogtahay sida ay u adag tahay oo run ahaantii la yaab leh.
It will never end again.	Mar dambe ma uu dhammaan doono.
So much better.	Si aad uga wanaagsan.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
He tried to take it.	Qaado ayuu isku dayay.
Appeared from me	Iga soo muuqday
But three years later there was a crisis.	Laakiin saddex sano ka dib waxaa dhacay dhibaato.
It really has.	Waxay leedahay runtii.
Tell him how smart he is.	U sheeg sida uu u caqli badan yahay.
He looked good.	Si fiican buu u eegay.
Until three years ago, that is.	Ilaa saddex sano ka hor, taasi waa.
Until we can do that.	Ilaa aan taas samayn karno.
He may never get it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan waligiis heli doonin.
Like, he really loves it.	Sida, runtii wuu jecel yahay.
Not bad.	Ma aha wax xun.
It's a little smaller.	Way ka yara yar tahay.
Picked up and laid down.	Soo qaaday oo dhigay.
Good day!.	Maalin wanaagsan!.
I could not see clearly.	Si cad uma arki karin.
He had to do something about it.	Waxay ahayd inuu wax ku sameeyo.
That will happen no matter what you do.	Taasi way dhici doontaa si kasta oo aad sameyso.
What a wonderful place.	Waa maxay meel yaab leh.
I'm not ready to go now.	Hadda diyaar uma ihi inaan tago.
He was clear.	Wuxuu ahaa mid cad.
He likes to be left alone.	Wuxuu jecel yahay in keligiis laga tago.
But obviously, there is something going on.	Laakiin sida cad, waxaa jira wax socda.
All good stuff.	Waxyaabo fiican oo dhan.
I wondered why.	Waxaan la yaabay sababta.
Really hard	Runtii aad u adag
Not sure the other one.	Ma hubo kan kale.
I had no time for anything else.	Wax kale waqti uma helin.
She did not tell anyone.	Cidna uma ay sheegin.
It should.	Waa in .
I could not give anything else.	Wax kale ma siin karin.
I say.	Waxaan leeyahay.
I found it very bad.	Waxaan u arkay inuu aad u xun yahay.
I just love him.	Kaliya waan jeclahay isaga.
We can't say otherwise.	Si kale uma odhan karno.
This is very lucky.	Tani waa mid aad u nasiib badan.
That is true.	Taasi waa runtii.
He felt abandoned.	Waxa uu dareemay in laga tagay.
Let him go everywhere.	Meel walba ha tago.
This should help.	Tani waa inay ku caawiso.
I want to study.	Waxaan rabaa in aan wax barto.
They are bigger than him.	Way ka weyn yihiin isaga.
He wondered what it was.	Waxa uu la yaabay waxa ay tahay.
But it is all true.	Laakiin dhammaan waa run.
Still, that is me.	Sidaas oo ay tahay, taasi waa aniga aniga.
I would love to see it.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan arko.
It was probably beautiful.	Waxay u badan tahay inay ahayd mid qurux badan.
Only that.	Kaliya in .
A lot has happened quickly.	Wax badan ayaa u dhacay si degdeg ah.
It was all over.	Wuu dhammaan ahaa.
I vehemently denied that.	Taas si xun ayaan u diiday.
No one would believe it.	Qofna ma rumaysan lahaa.
They are real.	Way dhab yihiin.
He would come home.	Wuxuu ka iman lahaa guriga.
You are very beautiful in person.	Qof ahaan aad baad u qurux badan tahay.
It is not a fast food.	Ma aha cunto degdeg ah.
I have great doing.	Waxaan leeyahay wax weyn samaynta.
In fact, you should.	Runtii, waa inaad.
I really don’t do that.	Runtii taas ma sameeyo.
He knew it all.	Wuu ogaa dhammaan.
It will not hurt.	Waxba ma yeeli doono.
No one would leave.	Qofna ma bixi lahaa.
He never did.	Waligiis ma samayn jirin.
That is why he does.	Taasi waa sababta uu u sameeyo.
I can't leave	Ma bixi karo
It can be difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid adag.
Probably not much.	Malaha ma badna.
I really don't know what to do now.	Runtii ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo hadda.
Do not leave the house.	Ha ka bixin guriga.
One day he was alone at home with her.	Maalin ayuu keligiis guriga kula joogay.
Probably missing.	Malaha waa la waayay.
It does not seem so.	Waxay u egtahay inaysan sidaas ahayn.
No one knows where he is going.	Qofna ma garanayo meesha uu tago.
What a great car.	Waa maxay baabuur weyn.
He is close to a man.	Wuxuu ku dhow yahay nin.
He said more than once.	Waxa uu sheegay in ka badan hal mar.
That is not really true.	Taasi run ahaantii sax maaha.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
But nothing was found there.	Laakiin ma jirin wax laga helay halkaas.
He was very positive.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u niyad fiican.
No one believed me.	Qofna ima rumaysan.
Get a new one.	Soo qaado mid cusub.
Do not go.	Ha tagin.
No one has done the same.	Ma jiro qof si isku mid ah u sameeyay.
He will probably go.	Waxay u badan tahay inuu tagi doono.
He may not.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan samayn.
I just said.	Kaliya waan sheegay.
All he had to do was find the place.	Waxa kaliya ee uu sameeyay waxay ahayd inuu helo meesha.
I really didn't know what to do.	Runtii ma garanayn wax uu sameeyo.
He didn't want to know.	Ma rabin inuu ogaado.
Tomorrow is a day.	Berri waa maalin.
He lied.	Been buu sheegay.
I think he knows what to do.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu garanayo wuxuu sameeyo.
He must be here today.	Waa in maanta halkan la joogaa.
But there are none.	Laakiin ma jiraan.
No one said anything.	Qofna waxba ma odhan.
I got a long car tomorrow.	Waxaan helay baabuur dheer berri.
Now it doesn't pay.	Hadda waxba kama bixin.
We thought they would leave us.	Waxaan is lahayn way naga tagi doonaan.
Let it go.	Ha iska baxo oo .
I thought you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad.
I'm really sorry about that.	Runtii waan ka xumahay taas.
It is here now.	Hadda waa halkan.
But there is more to it than that.	Laakiin waxaa jira in ka badan oo aan sidaas samayn.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
I really enjoyed it	aad ayaan uga helay
I can tell you that is enough.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa inay taasi ku filan tahay.
Not after this.	Ma aha tan ka dib.
There is a lot going on.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo socda.
And a lot of work.	Iyo shaqo badan.
But, now, he is gone.	Laakiin, hadda, wuu baxay.
Ah, you're lucky.	Ah, nasiib baad leedahay.
There is so much here.	Wax badan ayaa halkan ku jira.
He stayed for about a year.	Waxa uu joogay ilaa hal sano.
New job, new friends.	Shaqo cusub, saaxiibo cusub.
I love it so much.	Aad ayaan u jeclahay.
I love you	waan ku jeclahay
She did not want him to leave the room.	Ma ay rabin inuu qolka ka baxo.
She would do that.	Waxay sameyn lahayd taas.
That's right, three.	Waa sax, saddex.
Once that is done.	Marka taas la sameeyo.
There was no other money.	Lacag kale ma jirin.
You may not tell them what to do.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan u sheegin waxaad samaynayso.
He was quick.	Si degdeg ah ayuu u ahaa.
He came out.	Wuu soo baxay.
Everything will be fine.	Wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan.
I thought that was more than enough time.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay taasi ka badan tahay waqti ku filan.
And so on.	Iyo wixii la mid ah inta kale.
It was available	Waxay ahayd mid la heli karo
This is a good thing.	Tani waa wax fiican.
Any time, really.	Waqti kasta, runtii.
I saw you.	Waan ku arkay adiga.
It will be the same as before.	Waxay ahaan doontaa sidii hore.
There is really no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan runtii.
But there is always a lack.	Laakiin had iyo jeer waxaa jira wax la'aan.
She is good at it.	Way ku fiican tahay.
Maybe it came out for you.	Malaha wuu ku soo baxay adiga.
It is there to help.	Waa halkaas in lagu caawiyo.
Certainly someone wanted this before.	Hubaal qof baa tan hore u rabay.
Very happy with this.	Aad ugu faraxsan tan.
But, this is not true.	Laakiin, tani sax maaha.
He said that was not true.	Waxa uu sheegay in aanay taasi run ahayn.
Everything else was great.	Wax kasta oo kale ayaa ahaa mid weyn.
Maybe we still need him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan weli u baahanahay isaga.
But he can do it all together.	Laakiin aad ayuu u wada samayn karaa.
She had more to say.	Waxay lahayd in ka badan oo ay sheegto.
If he had seen me now.	Haddii uu hadda i arki lahaa.
He saw them all.	Wuu wada arkay.
In fact, they will do nothing.	Runtii, waxba ma samayn doonaan.
I still can't see you.	Wali kuma arki karo.
That was very close.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u dhow.
I no longer want to do that.	Mar dambe ma rabo inaan taas sameeyo.
This is really true.	Tani waa sax dhab ah.
She lost him.	Way wayday isaga.
I really have nothing.	Runtii waxba ma hayo.
I had to study hard.	Waxay ahayd inaan si adag u barto.
I am only one day, and.	Waxaan ahay hal maalin oo kaliya, iyo .
I don't see much.	Wax badan ma arko.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax wanaagsan.
He did not come.	Ma iman.
I wanted to talk to you.	Waxaan rabay inaan kula hadlo.
I can't lie	been ma sheegi karo
He is good to me.	Wuu ii fiican yahay.
You can't do that.	Taas ma samayn kartid.
No one owns it.	Qofna ma leh.
In the same way as it is today.	Si la mid ah sida ay maanta tahay.
But it is unnecessary.	Laakiin waa wax aan loo baahnayn.
I will be right.	Waxaan noqon doonaa mid sax ah.
I am happy for him.	waan ku faraxsanahay isaga.
He knew she would do it.	Wuu ogaa in ay yeeli doonto.
It wasn’t too bad.	Ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
That may be true, he thought.	Taasi run bay noqon kartaa, ayuu is yidhi.
Maybe it was fun here after all.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ahayd mid xiiso leh halkan ka dib oo dhan.
That was very interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
I know you want something from it.	Waan ogahay in aad wax ka rabto.
Whatever you do, don't stop.	Wax kasta oo aad samayso, ha joojin.
It has a big problem.	Dhib weyn bay leedahay.
This is a great thing.	Tani waa wax aad u fiican.
It's even worse.	Xitaa way u xun tahay.
I was not alone.	Keligaa ma ahayn.
Now I can't afford a new one.	Hadda maan awoodin mid cusub.
He didn't want to, but he wanted to.	Ma uusan rabin, laakiin waa uu rabay.
Not right.	Sax uma eka.
How can he tell that he is lost.	Sidee buu ugu sheegi karaa in uu waayay .
I'll see you soon.	aad baan ku arki doonaa dhawaan.
You need each one.	Waxaad u baahan tahay mid kasta.
No one knew where he was.	Meesha cidna kuma uu garanayn.
And not well.	Oo aan si fiican.
Maybe I had more.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan wax badan lahaa.
It’s all about you.	Waa adiga oo dhan.
Talking too much is something else.	In badan la hadlo waa wax kale.
That is enough for me.	Taasi waa igu filan tahay.
I think that’s all there is to it.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi ay ku dhan tahay halkaas.
Which he knew was a lie.	Taas oo uu ku ogaa inay been tahay.
I'm sorry for any inconvenience	Waan ka xumahay wixii dhib ah oo dhacay
A few years later, that was it.	Dhowr sano ka dib, taasi waxay ahayd.
She didn't want to be in it.	Ma ay rabin in ay ku jirto.
You need to do it together.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad wada sameyso.
I know he won't.	Waan ogahay inuusan yeeli doonin.
There may still be time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu weli jiro waqti.
Maybe she did a bit.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay samaysay xoogaa.
Which is interesting.	Taas oo ah mid xiiso leh.
I am so happy to see you.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan ku arko.
There is nothing but you.	Wax jira ma jiraan aan adiga ahayn.
That's what you did.	Sidaas ayaad samaysay.
There must be more than this.	Waa in ay jiraan wax ka badan tan.
He gave me nothing.	Waxba ima siin.
He was not in a position to do anything else.	Ma uusan joogin meel uu wax kale sameeyo.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
Not too much, not too little.	Ma badna, ma yara.
But, but.	Laakiin, laakiin.
That was amazing.	Taasi waxay ahayd yaab.
I could not speak to anyone.	Qofna lama aan hadli karin.
That was what he knew for sure.	Taasi waxay ahayd waxa uu si hubaal ah u ogaa.
No more.	Mar dambe ma jirto.
There is nothing complicated here.	Ma jiraan wax adag halkan.
And why would I think I am here.	Oo muxuu u malayn lahaa inaan halkan joogo.
Worse.	Wax ka xun.
For me, just take it.	Aniga ahaan, kaliya qaado.
Both are not the same.	Labaduba isku mid maaha.
This, too, is surprising.	Tani, sidoo kale, waa la yaab.
I will stay here	halkaan ayaan joogi doonaa
I would love it.	aad ayaan u jeclaan lahaa.
That was really, really good.	Taasi waxay ahayd runtii, runtii aad u fiican.
But that is what they do.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa ay sameeyaan.
She told me everything.	Wax walba way ii sheegtay.
But it really doesn’t, you know.	Laakiin run ahaantii ma samaynayso, waad ogtahay.
I got a chance.	Waxaan helay fursad.
More than likely.	In ka badan laga yaabo.
A lot is clear.	Wax badan ayaa iska cad.
you need me.	adiga ayaa ii baahan.
I don't know if we can win.	Ma garanayo in aan guulaysan karno.
It must be done correctly.	Waa in lagu sameeyaa si sax ah.
He seems familiar, as he used to be.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid la yaqaan, sidii uu ahaan jiray.
Now he is fine and wants to go home.	Hadda wuu fiican yahay oo wuxuu rabaa inuu guriga aado.
But she did not want that.	Laakiin taas ma ay rabin.
It is very difficult.	Aad ayuu u adag yahay.
But that is not the main reason.	Laakiin maaha sababta ugu weyn.
Really badly done.	Runtii si xun loo sameeyay.
I did it here with difficulty.	Si dhib ah ayaan halkan u sameeyay.
He made you tell him everything.	Wuxuu kaa dhigay inaad wax walba u sheegto isaga.
I really do, a lot of things.	Runtii waan sameeyaa, waxyaabo badan oo badan.
Something bad happened.	Wax xun baa dhacay.
How bad things are.	Sidee wax u xun.
It's true.	Waa run.
He spread it.	Wuu kala qaaday.
He heard something else.	Wax kale ayuu maqlay.
This can be a great place.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa meel fiican.
Everyone is there.	Qof walba meesha ayuu joogaa.
In the same way, something happened.	Isla sidaas oo kale, wax ayaa dhacay.
It is not time.	Ma aha waqti.
But I found nothing else.	Laakiin ma helin wax kale.
I don't feel anything.	Waxba kama dareemayo.
No one would like you.	Qofna kuma jeclaan lahayd.
It was new to him, too.	Waxay ahayd ku cusub isaga, sidoo kale.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto.
Take it.	Qaado.
He is the one who left.	Waa kii baxay.
They are new.	Way cusub yihiin.
And until he got it.	Iyo ilaa uu ku helay.
It would not do.	Ma yeeli lahayn.
I actually got a new car yesterday.	Runtii waxaan helay baabuur cusub shalay.
It can do several jobs.	Waxay qaban kartaa dhowr shaqo.
It was all very interesting.	Dhammaan waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
It was a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer ka hor.
And it's not over yet.	Oo weli ma dhammaan.
A good place.	Meel fiican.
A lot is going on for you.	Wax badan ayaa kuu socda.
I don't know where she is now.	Ma garanayo meel ay hadda joogto.
Now, don't tell me that anymore.	Hadda, mar dambe taas ha igu odhan.
And this friends.	Iyo tan saaxiibo ah.
But he knew where he was.	Laakiin wuu ogaa meesha uu joogo.
He’s a friend of yours, too, you know.	Waa saaxiib adiga, sidoo kale, waad ogtahay.
Took me to see.	I qaaday si aan u arko.
Wherever you want.	Meel kasta oo aad rabto.
There may not be.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan jirin.
I need beauty.	Waxaan u baahanahay qurux.
This was interesting.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
I can clearly see.	Waxaan si cad u arki karaa.
You are now ready.	Hadda diyaar baad u tahay.
I need something else.	Wax kale ayaan u baahanahay.
Anything that is nothing.	Wax kasta oo aan waxba ahayn.
I do not know how to return.	Ma garanayo si aan u noqdo.
And to me it looks interesting.	Oo aniga waxay u egtahay mid xiiso leh.
You can't do everything.	Wax walba ma samayn kartid.
Maybe they are all for him.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay isaga u dhan yihiin.
He does not want to leave.	Ma rabo inuu baxo.
Will stay again.	Mar kale sii joogi doona.
He was tall, beautiful.	Wuxuu ahaa mid dheer, qurux badan.
She did not succeed.	Way ku guulaysan wayday.
I left nothing.	Waxba kama tagin.
Who is not there.	Yaa aan meesha joogin.
he wondered.	ayuu is waydiiyay.
Let's do this.	Aan samayno tan.
Soon it will be better.	Dhawaan waxay noqon doontaa wax ka wanaagsan.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah .
Not all of me.	Dhammaan anigu aniga ma leh.
I know it doesn't matter to you.	Aniga waan ogahay in aysan waxba kula ahayn.
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
We can't stop now.	Hadda ma joojin karno.
That is not all.	Taasi kaliya maaha.
It's just me.	Waa aniga oo kaliya.
I can't go	Ma tagi karo
But he wants to see me.	Laakiin wuxuu rabaa inuu i arko.
That's a lot of money.	Taasi waa lacag badan.
Not for everyone.	Ma aha qof kasta.
It will take a long time, but you can still do it.	Waxay qaadan doontaa waqti dheer, laakiin weli waad samayn kartaa.
He knew everything.	Wax walba wuu ogaa.
This is good.	Tani way wanaagsan tahay.
I love that for him.	Taas waan ku jeclahay isaga.
I think she was an adult.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahayd qof weyn.
It is not urgent	Degdeg maaha
I really don't know how to do this.	Runtii ma garanayo si uu arrintan u sameeyo.
She had to help.	Waxay ahayd inuu caawiyo.
It was a really good time indeed.	Waxay ahayd wakhti aad u wanaagsan runtii.
That is enough for us.	Halkaas ayaa nagu filan.
It started a few years ago.	Wuxuu bilaabay dhowr sano ka hor.
I'm not sure if that is true.	Ma hubo inay taasi sax tahay.
I will find a good person.	Waxaan heli doonaa qof wanaagsan.
Let him do what he wants.	Ha sameeyo wuxuu rabo.
He has to be an adult.	Waa inuu yahay qof weyn.
So far, good.	Ilaa hadda, wanaagsan.
A lot, maybe.	Wax badan, malaha.
There is no promise.	Waxba ballan maaha.
Another great thing to do.	Wax kale oo weyn oo la sameeyo.
Certainly not.	Runtii run ahaantii maaha.
I could not say everything.	Wax walba uma sheegi karin.
This can be less than a day.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa in ka yar hal maalin.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
It will quickly pick up on new things.	Waxay si degdeg ah u soo qaadan doontaa waxyaabo cusub.
And no time.	Iyo wax waqti ah.
It is, it is, it is.	Waa, waa, waa.
It was always a lie.	Had iyo jeer been bay ahayd.
It's just a clear place.	Waa meel cad oo kaliya.
It will probably do something.	Waxay u badan tahay inay wax samayn doonto.
A man came out.	Nin baa soo baxay.
No one knows anything.	Qofna waxba ma yaqaan.
Available now	Hadda waxaa laga heli karaa
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
Now he looked.	Hadda ayuu eegay.
He will be able to tell.	Wuu awoodi doonaa inuu u sheego.
It's great.	Waa wax aad u fiican.
That is constant.	Taasi waa joogto.
This cannot happen immediately.	Tani si degdeg ah uma dhici karto.
I want it	waan rabaa
Tell me everything.	Wax walba ii sheeg.
This is not true	Tani run maaha
That has always been difficult for me.	Taasi had iyo jeer waa igu adag tahay aniga.
I knew.	Anigu waan ogaa.
It was a difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dhib badan.
That was probably great.	Taasi waxay ahayd malaha weyn.
I think this was great.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
Someone, please, give him a job !.	Qof, fadlan, isaga shaqo sii!.
He tried to help.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu caawiyo.
Nice place to stay.	Meel fiican oo la joogo.
This was a bad idea at a bad time.	Tani waxay ahayd fikrad xun waqti xun.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
He wanted to know what happened.	Wuxuu rabay inuu ogaado waxa dhacay.
Mostly it was good luck.	Inta badan waxay ahayd nasiib wanaagsan.
He could not stop	Waa joojin waayay
He would come, if he could.	Wuu iman lahaa, haddii uu awoodi lahaa.
He would get help.	Caawin buu heli lahaa.
He was once in prison.	Mar ayuu xabsiga ku jiray.
I don't want to eat	Ma rabo inaan cuno
Much better, really.	Wax badan ka wanaagsan, dhab ahaantii.
Like a prison.	Sida xabsiga.
This is also not an everyday thing.	Tani sidoo kale ma aha wax maalin kasta ah.
You are a lucky man.	Nin nasiib badan baad tahay.
I no longer needed it.	Mar dambe uma baahnayn.
No one does that.	Qofna taas ma sameeyo.
There wasn’t enough there, yet.	Ma jirin wax ku filan halkaas, weli.
Certainly not this.	Hubaal tani maaha.
It doesn't matter if he did.	Wax dhib ah malaha haddii uu sameeyay.
I can tell you this so far.	Tan waan kuu sheegi karaa ilaa hadda.
It was not home.	Ma ahayn guriga.
But is that true?	Laakiin taasi run ma tahay?.
Do not talk to anyone.	Cidna ha la hadlin.
I think you are one.	Waxaan filayaa inaad mid tahay.
It would catch him.	Way qaban lahayd isaga.
But, that is not much.	Laakiin, taasi wax badan maaha.
And another day.	Iyo berri kale.
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
He tried to help.	Wuxuu isku dayay inuu ku caawiyo.
There is nothing else but to see what it is.	Wax kale ma jiro, aan ka ahayn u arag waxa ay tahay.
I hold you for a long time.	Waxaan ku hayaa waqti dheer.
I love doing it	Waxaan jeclahay inaan sameeyo
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
I know someone who is currently in prison.	Waan garanayaa qof hadda xabsiga ku jira.
Nothing but how to look.	Waxba ma jiraan laakiin sida loo arko.
Three is enough.	Saddex ayaa ku filan.
He once thought he had gained a lot.	Waxa uu mar mooday in uu wax badan helay.
Maybe I even have something for you.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa wax kuu haysto.
I won't go now.	Ma tagi doono hadda.
Ah! 	Ah!
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
Probably we are.	Waxay u badan tahay inaan nahay.
But there was nothing else to do.	Laakiin ma jirin wax kale oo la sameeyo.
Why, he can do this every day.	Waa maxay sababta, wuu samayn karaa tan maalin kasta.
Every moment is loved as much as possible.	Waqti kasta oo la jecel yahay sida ay ugu badan yihiin.
Maybe it's something else.	Malaha waa wax kale.
In fact, he seemed almost happy.	Dhab ahaantii, wuxuu u muuqday mid ku dhow inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
I love him so much.	Aad ayaan uga jeclahay isaga.
I did not do this.	Anigu ma aan samayn tan.
I am just a man.	Waxaan ahay nin kaliya.
This is not a big deal for him.	Tani isaga wax weyn kuma aha.
He said.	Waxa uu yidhi.
Maybe he wanted to help.	Malaha wuxuu rabay inuu caawiyo.
No one is very happy.	Mid aad u faraxsan ma jiro.
Xun! 	Xun!
They will be told there is no other money.	Waxaa loo sheegi doonaa in aysan jirin lacag kale.
He said she did.	Wuxuu sheegay inay samaysay.
In fact, this is not the case.	Run ahaantii, tani sidaas maaha.
I will leave tomorrow.	Berri ayaan bixi doonaa.
But you did.	Laakiin waad samaysay.
Who thinks this will come.	Yaa u malaynayaa inay tani iman doonto.
I want to do more and learn more.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan sameeyo oo aan wax badan barto.
All this is a good job.	Dhammaan tani waa shaqo wanaagsan.
I wanted to see all this.	Waxaan rabay inaan tan oo dhan arko.
It didn't matter what happened to me.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn waxa igu dhacay.
Maybe not, but maybe not.	Malaha maaha, laakiin malaha.
If anything.	Haddii ay wax wanaagsan tahay.
He just wasn't.	Kaliya ma uusan ahayn.
I told you that.	Taas ayaan kuu sheegay.
They are small now.	Way yar yihiin hadda.
I know very well	Aad baan u garanayaa
In fact, it was.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay ahayd.
It can do something about it.	Way wax ka qaban kartaa.
It’s like work.	Waa sida shaqada.
This is worse than bad.	Tani way ka xun tahay wax xun.
It really was an amazing place.	Runtii waxay ahayd meel yaab leh.
It's a good thing.	Waa wax wanaagsan.
She was always there, always ready.	Had iyo jeer waxay ahayd halkaas, had iyo jeer diyaar.
I never did anything like that again.	Mar dambe ma samayn wax sidaas oo kale ah.
I think that's what you want.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay waxa aad rabto.
She had to help.	Waxay ahayd inuu caawiyo.
He had a good job and friends.	Waxa uu lahaa shaqo fiican iyo saaxiibo.
I went out again.	Mar kale ayaan baxay.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Wax uu ku sameeyo ma uu garanayn.
Too much money.	Lacag aad u badan.
I left	Waan ka baxay
A lot, really.	Wax badan, dhab ahaantii.
I really did.	Runtii waan sameeyay.
It will end again.	Mar kale way dhammaan doontaa.
I am still there.	Wali waan joogaa.
I say.	Waxaan leeyahay.
That can definitely happen.	Taasi hubaal way dhici kartaa.
He had no one.	Cidna ma uu lahayn.
In fact, it's hard, for a while.	Dhab ahaantii, wuu adag yahay, muddo.
You owe it.	Waa lagu leeyahay.
No one found me.	Qofna ima heli jirin.
The one who was there.	Kii meesha joogay.
I don't want to see much.	Ma rabo inaan wax badan arko.
What is here.	Waa maxay halkan.
I cant .	Ma awoodo .
It really was.	Runtii aad buu u ahaa.
All true.	Run oo dhan.
I can't get it right.	Si sax ah uma heli karo.
Obviously, it is not.	Sida cad, ma aha.
Not everyone can do this.	Qof kastaa ma samayn karo tan.
This will be the same	Tani waxay ahaan doontaa isku mid
He thinks she is ready.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inay diyaar tahay.
After all, someone has to do it.	Ka dib oo dhan, qof waa inuu sameeyo.
I even had a good time.	Xitaa waqti fiican ayaan qaatay.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I don’t think you should do that.	U malayn maayo inaad taas samayso.
You can now do any other job you want.	Waxaad hadda samayn kartaa wax kasta oo kale oo shaqo oo aad rabto.
I will come home early.	Hore ayaan guriga u iman doonaa.
I will definitely do this again.	Dhab ahaantii waan samayn doonaa tan mar kale.
He would certainly do it.	Hubaal wuu yeeli lahaa.
Maybe it's you.	Malaha waa adiga.
I would really like to see that.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan taas arko.
She picked it up one by one.	Mid mid bay u soo qaaday.
He looks like a very good man.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa nin aad u fiican.
It is really beautiful.	Runtii aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
Please, do not approach	Fadlan, ha u dhawaan
Three must do.	Saddex waa inay sameeyaan.
Like, that was great.	Sida, taasi waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
They should not pay anything.	Waa in aanay wax lacag ah siin.
He would do anything for it.	Wax walba wuu u samayn lahaa.
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
I wanted to go to school.	Waxaan rabay inaan aado dugsiga.
Please let everyone help me if it is good or not.	Fadlan qof kasta ha i caawiyo haddii ay fiican tahay iyo haddii kale.
Better than ever.	Si ka wanaagsan sidii hore.
They will.	Way samayn doonaan.
You are not alone in this.	Kaliya adiga kuma aadan joogin kan.
And he seemed to know a lot.	Oo wuxuu u muuqday inuu wax badan garanayo.
That would give it a chance.	Taasi waxay siin lahayd fursad.
He saw it as an opportunity.	Waxa uu u arkay fursad.
Just love all.	Kaliya jecel dhammaan.
I didn’t think it would be.	Uma malaynayn inay noqon doonto.
I thought that was beautiful.	Waxaan u maleeyay inay taasi qurux badan tahay.
He gave it to me most of the time.	Inta badan wuu i siiyay.
He was nowhere to be found.	Meel ma uu joogin.
After a few more.	Ka dib dhowr kale.
But he felt he knew exactly how it would be.	Laakiin wuxuu dareemay inuu si sax ah u garanayo sida ay noqon doonto.
And to know that you can't have it.	Iyo inaad ogaato inaadan haysan karin.
It is for sure.	Waa hubaal.
You can't lie.	Been uma sheegi karto.
It is so much unknown.	Waa wax aad u badan oo aan la garanayn.
He would come back.	Wuu soo noqon lahaa.
Never, ever.	Weligay, weligay ma arag.
I really need you to be there with me.	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaad halkaas ila joogto.
I couldn't tell you.	Waan kuu sheegi waayay.
But there was also a rush.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxaa jiray degdeg ah.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
.	.
He did help.	Caawin wuu sameeyay.
Anytime, anywhere, anyone.	Waqti kasta, meel kasta, qof kasta.
Take it if you want.	Qaado haddii aad rabto.
He is sure to leave.	Waa hubaal inuu baxo.
But you just can’t fall for it.	Laakiin kaliya kuma dhici kartid.
I was there for a year.	Hal sano ayaan halkaas joogay.
He came to see you three times.	Saddex jeer buu u yimid inuu ku arko.
I always do.	Had iyo jeer waan sameeyaa.
Not just now.	Kaliya maaha hadda.
I am really all.	Waxaan ahay dhab dhammaan.
And it was like everything else.	Oo waxay ahayd sida wax kasta oo kale.
I do it now	hadda waan sameeyaa
You know enough is enough.	Waad ogtahay in kugu filan.
This did not exist before.	Tani hore uma jirin.
you have not seen.	ma aadan arag .
That is good to know.	Taasi waa wax fiican in la ogaado.
I have other things to do.	Waxaan hayaa waxyaabo kale oo aad sameyso.
I told you, he is not really a man.	Waxaan kuu sheegay, runtii nin maaha.
He is still alive, but he is young.	Wali wuu nool yahay, laakiin wuu yar yahay.
No one is over.	Qofna ma dhammaan.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wax aad ka qaban karto maaha.
It was true enough.	Waxay ahayd run ku filan.
We would do well for everyone.	Waxaan ku fiicnaan lahayn qof walba.
Even if it is bad for me.	Xitaa haddii uu aniga ii xun yahay.
I just have to be very happy.	Kaliya waa inaan aad u faraxsanahay.
That cannot be stopped.	Taas lama joojin karo.
There are so many surprises.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la yaab leh.
No one can do it.	Qofna ma yeeli karo.
She didn't have one.	Ma aysan haysan mid ka mid ah.
We can't stay there.	Ma sii joogi karno halkaas.
You said.	Waad sheegtay.
A little more.	Wax kale oo yar.
As long as that is what she wants to do.	Ilaa iyo inta ay taasi tahay waxa ay rabto inay sameyso.
But there was not enough time.	Laakiin ma jirin waqti ku filan.
He didn't want to see me.	Ma uu rabin inuu i arko.
It is not the same.	Wax la mid ah maaha.
He could not do anything right.	Wax sax ah ma uu samayn karin.
I tried, once.	Waxaan isku dayay, hal mar.
You can do what you would do.	Waxaad samayn kartaa waxaad samayn lahayd.
It will be great to be with us.	Aad bay u fiicnaan doontaa inay nala joogto.
It's just what it is.	Kaliya waa waxa ay tahay.
But it will be difficult.	Laakiin waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
You were lucky.	Nasiib baad ahayd.
It should have existed.	Waxay ahayd inay jirto.
They are bad.	Way xun yihiin.
I just wonder how small it really is.	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay u yar tahay runtii.
I would not do this.	Anigu ma aan samayn lahaa tan.
.	.
And well done! 	Oo si fiican!
Everyone has one.	Qof kastaa mid buu leeyahay.
This is what he got.	Tani waa waxa uu helay.
He was fun to be with.	Wuxuu ahaa mid xiiso leh inuu la joogo.
One, obviously, was time.	Mid, sida cad, wuxuu ahaa waqti.
I am not one of them.	Anigu ka mid ma ihi.
She was smart, beautiful, too.	Waxay ahayd mid caqli badan, oo qurux badan, sidoo kale.
I want to go home	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga
There was nothing false.	Ma jirin wax been ah.
So it was still.	Sidaas ayuu weli ahaa.
He seems to be missing.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid la waayay.
He told me what he wanted to do.	Wuxuu ii sheegay wuxuu rabo inuu sameeyo.
I have already given a lot of money.	Waxaan hore u siiyay lacag aad u badan.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
There is something that someone can do.	Waxaa jira wax qof samayn karo.
Today and every day.	Maanta iyo maalin kasta.
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa dhab.
I am here	waan joogaa
They should.	Waa inay.
It will definitely require hard work.	Waxaa hubaal ah in ay u baahan doonto shaqo adag.
Just don't leave me.	Kaliya ha iga tagin.
I'm happy to be there.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkaas joogo.
You would love that.	Waad jeclaan lahayd taas.
So much is going on.	Aad u badan ayaa socda.
I am the only one who does not have.	Waxaan ahay ka kaliya ee aan haysan.
He walked in the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka soo galay.
I'm glad you can be there.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad halkaas joogi karto.
It's more than that.	Waa ka sii badan tahay .
Maybe I’m out now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan hadda soo baxay.
I want to be your favorite person too.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sidoo kale kuu noqdo qof ku jecel.
He knows when he is good.	Wuu garanayaa marka uu u fiican yahay.
You cannot tell them all at once.	Ma wada sheegi kartid hal mar.
I will stay there	Waan joogi doonaa halkaas
I felt the same thing.	Waxaan dareemay wax isku mid ah.
I knew hard work.	Waxaan ogaa shaqo adag.
Here is everything to discover.	Halkan waxaa ah wax walba oo la ogaado.
I hope you will love it !.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad jeclaan doonto!.
No wonder everyone loves you.	La yaab ma leh in qof walba ku jecel yahay.
I can't do this.	Tani ma samayn karo.
I need to know something about this.	Waa inaan arrintan wax ka ogaado.
.	.
Certainly not.	Hubaal maaha.
I looked all over and lost.	Dhammaan waan eegay oo waan waayay.
I thought it was all over.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay dhammaan.
lama jecli.	lama jecli.
But that is not what you need.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa aad u baahan tahay.
Just a lot.	Kaliya wax badan.
I have always wondered how it will be.	Waxaan had iyo jeer la yaabay sida ay noqon doonto.
Any money.	Lacag kasta.
Most if not all are fine.	Inta badan haddii aan dhammaan waa wanaagsan yihiin.
I went to see him.	Waxaan u tagay inaan arko.
I thought that was not the case.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaysan taasi ahayn.
But nothing was visible.	Laakiin ma jirin wax la arki karo.
It's hard for you.	Way kugu adag tahay.
To tell you everything.	Si aan wax walba ugu sheego.
It’s here again already.	Waa halkan mar kale mar hore.
After what he did.	Ka dib wixii uu sameeyay.
Tan.	Tan .
All as bad.	Dhammaan sida xun.
Do not let anyone.	Cidna ha u ogolaan.
The same, too, with food.	La mid ah, sidoo kale, oo leh cunto.
I am happy for you.	Waan kugu faraxsanahay.
You will need it.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa.
This is not true.	Tani run maaha.
I am very sorry about this.	Aad ayaan uga xumahay arrintan.
It was already too big.	Waxay ahayd mar hore aad u weyn.
I haven't seen much.	Wax badan ma arag.
She did not like him.	Ma ay jeclayn isaga.
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan run ahayn.
It's all new.	Dhammaan waa cusub.
I will also discuss this issue.	Waxaan sidoo kale ka hadli doonaa arrintan.
There is so much opportunity just there.	Waxaa jira fursad badan oo kaliya halkaas.
I think that was true for me.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi run igu ahayd.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi run maaha.
It is always something.	Had iyo jeer waa wax.
But this he seemed to do.	Laakiin tan wuxuu u muuqday inuu sameeyo.
I did not do everything right.	Wax walba si sax ah uma samayn.
That is not a bad thing.	Taasi wax xun maaha.
I became invisible.	Waxaan noqday mid aan la arki karin.
I saw enough for me here.	Waxaan arkay wax igu filan halkan.
Please do not misunderstand.	Fadlan ha fahmin.
I have never seen him happy.	Weligay ma arag isaga oo faraxsan.
He made it bad.	Wuxuu ka dhigay mid xun.
I will find you.	Waan ku heli doonaa.
She is very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan tahay.
No luck again.	Nasiib ma leh mar kale.
The people in it.	Dadka meesha ku jira.
It didn't help.	Ma aysan caawin.
I don’t have to know everything.	Ma aha in aan wax walba ogaado.
That's what you don't get.	Taasi waa waxa aadan helin.
You can leave now.	Waad bixi kartaa hadda.
So far nothing new.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax cusub.
There is nothing better.	Ma jiro wax ka fiican.
I have never seen anything like it.	Weligay ma arag wax la mid ah.
Much smarter now.	In badan oo caqli badan hadda.
He did not lie.	Been ma sheegin.
I know she is there.	Waan ogahay inay halkaas joogto.
What will happen to you.	Maxaa kugu dhici doona.
It is very difficult to find.	Aad bay u adag tahay in la helo.
Not just any job.	Ma aha oo kaliya shaqo kasta.
There is a lot you do not understand.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo aadan fahmin.
Much the same.	Wax badan oo la mid ah.
But, I must.	Laakiin, waa in aan.
That is you.	Taasi waa adiga.
I have heard this from you.	Tan baan kaa maqlay.
Let me tell you.	Si aan kuu sheego.
I want to be surprised.	Waxaan rabaa in aan la yaabay.
It was a good place like any other.	Waxay ahayd meel wanaagsan sida mid kasta.
He would not do that.	Ma uu yeeli lahaa taas.
He did not see it today.	Maanta ma uu arag.
He didn't want to see anything, either.	Ma uusan rabin inuu wax arko, sidoo kale.
You had me.	Waad i lahayd .
Obviously there is.	Waxaa cad in ay jirto.
There was nothing.	Waxba kuma jirin.
It may be very difficult.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u adag.
Still very good.	Weli aad u fiican.
It was new.	Waxay ahayd cusub.
They probably don't even know how.	Waxay u badan tahay inaysan xitaa garanayn sida.
No problem it was.	Dhib ma lahayn waxay ahayd.
I will not allow it.	Ma ogolaan doono.
Maybe it was.	Malaha waxay ahayd.
I want to know where I am going, right.	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado meesha aan aado, si sax ah.
There was no time.	Waqti ma jirin.
It was a lucky day.	Waxay ahayd maalin nasiib badan.
He fell.	Wuu ku dhacay.
It certainly was.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu ahaa.
Once in a while, it probably won’t hurt.	Hal mar, malaha waxba ma yeeli doonto .
But he doesn't want to talk anymore.	Laakiin ma rabo inuu mar dambe hadlo.
And a little surprise.	Iyo yaab yar.
I will not always be able to say that.	Mar walba taas ma awoodi doono inaan sheego.
I wish you were here with us.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaad halkan nala joogto.
That is not surprising.	Taasi la yaab maaha.
They are beautiful.	Way qurux badan yihiin.
She said she said.	Waxay tidhi waxay tidhi.
This is not always popular.	Tani mar walba ma aha mid la jecel yahay.
Let's do the same.	Aan ku samayno sidaas oo kale.
It's a good day.	Waa maalin wanaagsan.
That is a promise.	Taasi waa ballan.
He is there.	Wuu joogaa.
I would love to see it.	Jeclahay inaan arko.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
I have already tried	mar hore ayaan isku dayay
But what interesting.	Laakiin maxaa xiiso leh.
That was today.	Taasi waxay ahayd maanta.
Not sure if you can get one.	Ma hubo inaad heli karto mid la mid ah.
Now he loves it.	Hadda wuu jecel yahay.
And, he didn't.	Oo, taas ma uu samayn.
It was a good idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad fiican.
He did another.	Mid kale ayuu ku sameeyay.
He would be much better.	Aad ayuu uga fiicnaan lahaa.
No one can be like that.	Qofna sidaas ma noqon karo.
I hope he does.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu sameeyo.
This is what you will do.	Tani waa waxa aad sameyn doonto.
Much more.	Wax badan oo ka sii badan.
I really want him.	Aad baan u rabaa isaga.
It was an amazing idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad la yaab leh.
It will help you.	Way ku caawin doontaa.
Very fresh and very good.	Aad u cusub oo aad u wanaagsan.
You can go anywhere you want.	Waxaad tagi kartaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
And doing homework.	Iyo samaynta shaqada guriga.
Anything else.	Wax kale.
But you do not understand.	Laakiin ma aadan fahmin.
I just didn’t do one.	Mid kaliya ma samayn.
As it always has been.	Sida ay had iyo jeer ahaan lahayd.
But that was exactly what a man did.	Laakiin taasi dhab ahaan waxay ahayd waxa uu nin sameeyay.
And let me go.	Oo aan tago.
Everything is clear.	Wax walba waa cad yihiin.
I couldn't help it.	Waan caawin waayay.
I can find you	waan ku heli karaa
I can see.	waan arki karaa .
At first no one could see him.	Markii hore qofna ma uu arki karin.
He knew what he wanted.	Wuu ogaa waxa uu rabo.
I tried to pick it up.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan ka qaado.
Not that it was too much.	Ma aha in ay ahayd mid aad u badan.
They may not have a job.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aanay haysan shaqo.
There is no charge.	Lacag kuma jirto.
I know it's not true.	Waan ogahay inaysan run ahayn.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha.
You will be happy.	Waxaad noqon doontaa mid faraxsan.
She can still be there.	Weli way joogi kartaa halkaas.
I would do it	waan samayn lahaa
I don't know anything anymore.	Wax dambe ma garanayo.
It's hard there.	Way adag tahay halkaas.
Which really surprised me.	Taas oo runtii aniga igu yaab badan.
Maybe the whole house.	Laga yaabaa in guriga oo dhan.
That is not surprising at all.	Taasi la yaab maaha runtii.
He got this.	Waxa uu helay tan.
And a little more.	Iyo in yar oo kale.
In fact, it would probably be better if you didn't.	Dhab ahaantii, waxay u badan tahay inay fiican tahay haddii aadan ahayn.
He seems to still love it.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa inuu ilaa hadda jecel yahay.
He is always with us.	Mar walba wuu nala joogaa.
They love it.	Waxay jecel yihiin.
He doesn't want to know that.	Ma rabo inuu taas ogaado.
I don't think it will be good.	Uma maleynayo inay fiicnaan doonto.
He may never have done so.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan waligiis sidaas samayn.
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
He had, so, there.	Waxa uu lahaa, si, halkaas.
It will not be so.	Sidaas ma noqon doonto.
You do not need	Uma baahnid
Maybe no one does.	Malaha qofna ma sameeyo.
He is a former friend.	Waa saaxiib hore.
I can't make an appointment.	Wax ballan ah ma samayn karo.
That was not surprising.	Taasi ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
No, but it is there.	Ma jiro, laakiin waa halkaas.
You know that's not true.	Waad ogtahay taasi sax maaha.
Time to study.	Waqti wax lagu barto.
I can't say enough.	Ku filan ma odhan karo.
I did it happily.	Aniga oo faraxsan ayaan sidaas sameeyay.
But, this was not alive	Laakiin, tani ma ahayn mid nool
But there is so much more to do.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax badan oo kale oo la sameeyo.
I don't feel true.	Ma dareemayo run.
you were busy	mashquul baad ahayd
For me, everything is more difficult.	Aniga, wax walba way iga dhib badan tahay.
They did not believe him.	Ma ay rumaysan isaga.
And very interesting.	Oo aad u xiiso badan.
Not now.	Hadda maaha .
It was the only thing he knew to do.	Waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee uu ogaa inuu sameeyo.
It can now be said.	Hadda waa la sheegi karaa.
Not much.	Wax badan ma jiraan.
Nothing can be done	Waxba lama qaban karo
That’s what everyone does, always.	Taas oo ah waxa qof walba sameeyo, mar walba.
They love to do it, really.	Waxay jecel yihiin inay sameeyaan, dhab ahaantii.
It's all over.	Way dhan tahay.
Everyone heard.	Qof kastaa wuu maqlay.
He just said he would go there.	Waxa uu sheegay oo kaliya inuu halkaas tagi doono.
There is a lot going on.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo badan oo socda.
Everyone wants to know the same things.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu ogaado waxyaabo isku mid ah.
Nothing happened.	Wax iska dhacay maaha.
I heard it all.	Waan wada maqlay.
Often there is something bigger than work.	Inta badan waxaa jira wax ka weyn shaqada.
It was felt at the same time.	Waxa la dareemay isku mar isku mid ah isku mar.
You will be fine.	Waad u fiicnaan doontaa.
I would rather be here.	Waxaan ka jeclaan lahaa inaan halkaan joogo.
Very good, really.	Aad u fiican, dhab ahaantii.
It belongs to you.	Adiga ayaa iska leh.
This cannot happen.	Tani sidaas ma dhici karto.
I love how it is.	Waan jeclahay sida ay tahay.
I don't get this.	Anigu tan ma helo.
It is enough.	Way ku filan tahay.
She told us it was all over.	Waxay noo sheegtay waxay ahayd oo dhan.
He does whatever he likes.	Wuxuu sameeyaa wax kasta oo uu jecel yahay.
But it should not be stopped.	Laakiin waa in aan la joojin.
You are one of us.	Waxaad tahay mid naga mid ah.
Now we live here.	Hadda waxaan ku nool nahay halkan.
Like, it's just weird.	Sida, waa wax yaab leh oo kaliya.
Nothing was done.	Waxba lama qaban.
Everyone has a problem.	Qof kastaa dhib buu leeyahay.
It may exist now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu hadda jiro.
But he will not do that.	Laakiin taas ma samayn doono.
But you can do something about it.	Laakiin taas ayaad wax ka qaban kartaa.
Spend time and money.	Waqti iyo lacag ku qaatay.
What you like.	Waxa aad jeceshahay.
It can take a long time to figure this out.	Waxay qaadan kartaa waqti dheer in la ogaado taas.
I can do it, too.	Waan samayn karaa, sidoo kale.
One day you may find out.	Maalin ayaa laga yaabaa inaad ogaato.
I wouldn’t give him a chance to do it again.	Ma siin lahaa fursad uu mar kale ku sameeyo.
You just have to be alone.	Waxa kaliya oo ay tahay in aad keligaa ku jirto.
I know you want to.	Waan ogahay inaad rabto.
That is not a problem.	Taasi wax dhib ah maaha.
He is a good man.	Waa nin fiican.
But that will not do.	Laakiin taasi ma yeeli doonto.
Just to talk.	Kaliya inaan hadlo.
You told me so well.	Si fiican baad ii sheegtay.
It really was real.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
More than really.	In ka badan run ahaantii.
He was surprised.	Wuu yaabay.
Everyone is better.	Qof walba wuu ka fiican yahay.
Everything I need is there.	Wax kasta oo aan u baahanahay ayaa jira.
It was rejected.	Waa la diiday.
I really love you	Runtii waan ku jeclahay
Maybe you can tell me.	Malaha waad ii sheegi kartaa.
I will love it	waan jeclaan doonaa
They didn't want to do it.	Ma ay rabin inay sameeyaan.
Strongly rejected.	Si weyn ayaa loo diiday.
I think they are beautiful.	Waxaan filayaa inay qurux badan yihiin.
This was not a difficult thing to do.	Tani ma ahayn wax adag in la sameeyo.
I say he always does.	Waxaan leeyahay mar walba wuu sameeyaa.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
There were many things.	Waxyaabo badan ayaa jiray.
And now it was time.	Oo hadda waxay ahayd wakhti.
He is an unbelievable person.	Waa qof aan la rumaysan karin.
I don't want to do anything else with you.	Wax kale oo uu kugu sameeyo ma rabo.
I want to know	Waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado
He has to work hard forever.	Waa inuu waligiis si adag u shaqeeyo.
If he does, it could happen.	Haddii uu taas sameeyo, way dhici kartaa.
Not exactly.	Ma aha si sax ah.
Because there is no time.	Sababta oo aan waqti lahayn.
I need to know.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado.
No wonder you have no friends.	La yaab ma leh inaadan saaxiib lahayn.
It can be withdrawn.	Waa laga noqon karaa.
It could happen tomorrow.	Waxay dhici kartaa berri.
Probably as bad.	Malaha sida xun.
There may be other things.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan waxyaabo kale.
That is why he is there.	Waa sababta uu halkaas u joogo.
You love him.	Waad jeceshahay isaga.
Still a good idea.	Wali waa fikrad wanaagsan.
Let me know if I can help.	I soo sheeg haddii aan ku caawin karo.
But he didn't want to, really.	Laakiin ma uusan rabin, runtii.
Very beautiful.	Aad u qurux badan.
So far you haven't.	Ilaa hadda ma aadan haysan.
Now it is.	Hadda waa.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha.
He is missing.	Waa la waayay.
In the same way as you.	Si la mid ah adiga.
That is a known problem.	Taasi waa dhibaato la yaqaan.
It is all very strange.	Dhammaan waa wax aad u yaab leh.
You can really help why.	Runtii waad caawin kartaa sababta.
As you wish.	Sida aad doonto.
It was a bad place.	Meel xun bay u ahayd.
And very little.	Oo aad u yar.
Someone gave it to me.	Qof baa i siiyay.
But it is not, really.	Laakiin maaha, runtii.
I would love to find someone like that.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan helo qof sidaas oo kale ah.
I looked away.	Waan iska eegay.
He had better things to do.	Waxa uu lahaa waxyaabo ka fiican oo uu sameeyo.
I know this now.	Waan ogahay tan hadda.
But he always refused.	Laakiin mar walba wuu diiday.
That is what everyone has.	Taasi waa waxa qof kastaa leeyahay.
He saw.	Waxa uu arkay.
It has powers.	Waxay leedahay awoodo.
Probably only three.	Malaha saddex kaliya.
Whenever you like.	Mar kasta oo aad jeceshahay.
Now this is something.	Hadda tani waa wax.
I don't know the exact place.	Meel sax ah ma garanayo.
There is more and less.	Wax ka badan iyo wax ka yar ma jiraan.
I could not.	Ma awoodin.
Only one problem.	Hal dhibaato oo kaliya .
I have to go	waa inaan tago
This may not be obvious but it is true.	Tani ma noqon karto mid cad laakiin waa run.
He had to stay home.	Waxay ahayd inuu guriga joogo.
This is exactly what happened.	Tani waa si sax ah waxa dhacay.
A man who is very good.	Nin yaa aad u fiican.
He wanted nothing more.	Wax kale ma uu rabin.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
He never got it.	Waligiis ma helin.
All good work.	Shaqo fiican oo dhan.
Don't come here.	Halkan ha iman.
It was money and long.	Waxay ahayd lacag iyo dheer.
She didn't tell him to go.	Uma ay sheegin inuu aado.
The people you will love.	Dadka aad jeclaan doontaa.
It seems like a big deal.	Waxay ila tahay wax weyn.
I am, really.	Waxaan ahay, run ahaantii.
Please do not mention	Fadlan ha sheegin
Something he did more than once.	Wax uu sameeyay wax ka badan hal mar.
Probably better.	Malaha wax ka wanaagsan.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
We just.	Waxaan kaliya .
But that is not the case.	Laakiin taasi maaha.
There was nothing she would like more.	Ma jirin wax ay ka jeclaan lahayd.
And to put it another way, there is no strike.	Iyo in mar kale la sheego, ma jirto shaqo joojin.
He is very good at all.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay oo dhan.
This is really nothing new.	Tani dhab ahaantii wax cusub maaha.
I can't do it all.	Ma awoodo dhammaan.
But tell me why.	Laakiin ii sheeg sababta.
In fact, he does.	Runtii, wuu sameeyaa.
That is not smart.	Taasi caqli badan maaha.
But more is needed.	Laakiin wax badan ayaa loo baahan yahay.
Just don’t do it.	Kaliya ha samayn.
It really is a problem.	Dhab ahaantii waa dhibaato.
It was good, he knew.	Waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan, wuu ogaa.
That is fine.	Taasi waa si fiican.
That was a lie.	Taasi waxay ahayd been.
It is now.	Waa hadda.
It doesn't look like it used to.	Uma eka sidii hore oo kale.
They have disappeared.	Waa la is waayay.
Mostly nothing.	Inta badan wax ma aha.
Can someone please help me with this.	Qof fadlan ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
Something came out of me.	Wax baa igu soo baxay.
You can pay it back.	Dib ayaad u bixin kartaa.
I have seen people before.	Hore ayaan dadka ugu arkay.
Everyone would come soon.	Qof kastaa wuu iman lahaa dhawaan.
I really came out.	Runtii waan ka soo baxay.
It looks good.	Si fiican ayuu u muuqdaa.
I am still here.	Wali halkaan ayaan joogaa.
They are very smart.	Aad bay u caqli badan yihiin.
They will help you.	Way ku caawin doonaan.
It was long enough.	Waxay ahayd waqti dheer oo ku filan.
All very beautiful.	Dhammaan aad u qurux badan.
They will not.	Ma yeeli doonaan.
This is great.	Tani waa mid aad u fiican.
He was really surprised.	Runtii wuu yaabay.
This requires only once.	Tani waxay u baahan tahay kaliya hal mar.
She had to.	Waxay ahayd inay .
No one found it.	Cidna ma uu helin.
An unloved person.	Qof aan la jeclayn.
It looks as good as new.	Waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan sida cusub.
And otherwise, still great.	Oo haddii kale, weli weyn.
Everyone else should do it.	Waa in qof kasta oo kale sameeyo.
But that is what he did.	Laakiin taasi waa waxa uu sameeyay.
This has a lot to do.	Tani waxay leedahay wax badan oo la sameeyo.
It is where he leaves me.	Waa meesha uu iga tago.
But they still love it.	Laakiin wali way jecel yihiin.
So true anyway.	Sidaas run si kasta.
That is hard to do.	Taasi waa adag tahay in la sameeyo.
La la la la.	La la la la.
It is always the same.	Had iyo jeer waa isku mid.
I didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inaan haysto.
He thought it was beautiful.	Wuxuu mooday inay qurux badan tahay.
I want to know.	Waxaan rabaa in la ogaado.
It had to be done.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo.
I am very busy now.	Hadda aad ayaan mashquul u ahay.
It has one minor problem.	Waxay leedahay hal dhibaato oo yar.
But there is something wrong with the work.	Laakiin waxaa jira wax xun shaqada.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
You know you like it.	Waad ogtahay inaad jeceshahay.
Indeed, that is.	Runtii, taasi waa.
I really can't believe this.	Runtii tan ma rumaysan karo.
Not small.	Ma yara.
You are the reason they are.	Waxaad tahay sababta ay u yihiin.
I do what is required of me.	Waxaan sameeyaa waxa la iga rabo.
He is a good man.	Waa nin wanaagsan.
Something to do.	Wax la sameeyo.
After all you have done for me.	Ka dib wax kasta oo aad ii samaysay.
In fact, it's great, for a while.	Dhab ahaantii, aad bay u fiican tahay, muddo.
I started to wonder.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay.
There is no other way to do it.	Ma jirto si kale oo aad u samayn karto.
You must be very happy.	Waa inaad aad u faraxsan tahay.
No one gets it.	Qofna ma helo.
But I can't do it.	Laakiin ma samayn karo.
He was a very bad friend.	Waxa uu ahaa saaxiib aad u xun.
I will tell people if you want.	Waxaan dadka u sheegi doonaa haddii aad rabto.
I have something for him, right now.	Wax baan ku hayaa isaga, hadda.
I suspect you have the same problem.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in aad dhib isku mid ah leedahay.
Like all.	Sida oo dhan.
I am very busy.	Aad ayaan mashquul u ahay.
And, that was true for me, too.	Iyo, taasi run bay ii ahayd aniga, sidoo kale.
I don't think you will.	U malayn maayo inaad yeeli doonto.
He knows as much as he can.	Wuu garanayaa ilaa iyo inta uu awoodo.
Really, I really did.	Runtii, runtii waan sameeyay.
There was little.	Wax yar baa jiray.
This is something to be said.	Tani waa mid ay tahay in la sheego.
He said as well.	Wuxuu yiri sidoo kale.
Whatever it is, it cannot be bad.	Wax kasta oo ay tahay, ma noqon karto wax xun.
He is here.	Halkan ayuu joogaa.
I can tell you how it feels for us.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa sida ay noo tahay.
But not everyone is lucky.	Laakiin qof kastaa maaha mid nasiib badan.
It was only one year.	Waxay ahayd kaliya hal sano.
Here is what you do.	Waxa aad samayso waa kan.
I thought you were still.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad weli tahay.
I don't want to leave you.	Ma rabo inaan kaa tago.
If they love you, they will still love you.	Haddii ay ku jecel yihiin, weli way ku jeclaan doonaan.
They need it.	Waxay u baahan yihiin.
In fact, each.	Dhab ahaantii, mid kasta.
She had to help.	Waxay ahayd inuu caawiyo.
I know you are there	Waan ogahay inaad halkaas joogto
I don't have that right now.	Taas hadda ma hayo.
This is not how it will be for you.	Tani ma aha sida ay ahaan doonto adiga.
She would expect me.	Waxay iga filan lahayd.
Not here	Aan joogin halkan
But this is the only thing it is.	Laakiin tani waa waxa kaliya ee ay tahay.
.	.
I'm sure he will like it.	Waan hubaa inuu jeclaan doono.
But that should come as no surprise.	Laakiin taasi waa inaysan la yaab lahayn.
You were quick.	Degdeg baad ahayd.
I'm not really sure why.	Runtii ma hubo sababta taasi tahay.
He never got it.	Waligiis ma helin.
And maybe it was.	Oo malaha waxay ahayd.
But it was not in any way known.	Laakiin ma jirin si kasta oo la yaqaan.
I'm not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta taasi tahay.
There was no problem.	Wax dhib ah kuma jirin.
But someone was there.	Laakiin qof baa meesha joogay.
He will do so today.	Maanta ayuu sidaas yeeli doonaa.
See you tomorrow.	Berri ayaan ku arki doonaa.
If you don’t need to do it, it’s not a job.	Haddii aadan u baahnayn inaad sameyso, ma aha shaqo.
He knew he could still come back.	Wuu ogaa inuu wali soo noqon karo.
That is not a permanent job.	Taasi maaha shaqo joogto ah.
I would not believe it.	Ma rumaysan lahayn.
Maybe she did.	Malaha way samaysay.
But one is because of another.	Laakiin mid waa sababta oo ah mid kale.
He did a lot.	Wax badan ayuu sameeyay.
There were things to do.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo la sameeyo.
Happy is a friend.	Ku faraxsanahay waa saaxiib.
I will get it	waan heli doonaa
Beautiful things.	Waxyaabo qurux badan.
This was new to me.	Tani waxay igu ahayd mid igu cusub .
Another day.	Maalin kale .
He was not able to see.	Ma uusan awoodin inuu arko.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
It was so much fun.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u xiiso badan.
I need it.	Waan u baahanahay.
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
It is the only school for you.	Waa dugsiga kaliya ee adiga.
I need to talk.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan hadlo.
That should be sufficient enough.	Taas ayaa ku filan.
I know she is at home.	Waan ogahay inay guriga joogto.
I want to be myself	Waxaan rabaa inaan aniga ahay
I think he went home.	Waxaan u malaynayaa inuu guriga aaday.
I can't stop.	Ma joojin karo.
You can't be.	Ma noqon kartid.
Again she refused.	Mar kale way diiday.
It looks like that.	Waxay u egtahay sidaas.
He lied.	Been buu sheegay.
Still, it's good.	Weli, way wanaagsan tahay.
And, well.	Iyo, si fiican.
She can get a better job.	Waxay heli kartaa shaqo ka fiican.
She really did.	Dhab ahaantii way samaysay.
Give him something else to do.	Sii wax kale oo uu sameeyo.
Great adult.	Qof weyn oo weyn.
First, it is very difficult.	Marka hore, aad bay u adag tahay.
You will do it	Waad samayn doontaa
Is it really like that.	Ma dhab baa sidaas oo kale.
I also had a job.	Waxaan sidoo kale lahaa shaqo.
She certainly did.	Hubaal way samaysay.
I found it very difficult.	Waxaan u arkay inay aad u adag tahay.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
There is not much going on.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo socda.
It is a beautiful place.	Waa meel qurux badan.
I liked it a lot.	Wax badan ayaan ka helay.
But it can be.	Laakiin way noqon kartaa.
Very difficult.	Aad u adag.
Please take it that way.	Fadlan sidaas u qaado.
I wanted to help	Waxaan rabay inaan ku caawiyo
I would leave	Waan ka bixi lahaa
You need more	Waxaad u baahan tahay wax badan
For a while now.	In muddo ah ayaa hadda.
This may be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa run.
There are not even.	Xitaa ma jiraan.
As well as others.	Sidoo kale dadka kale.
Here is what you are up to	Waa kan waxa aad ugu jirto
They will not get it.	Ma heli doonaan.
Also.	Sidoo kale.
Only one person left.	Hal qof oo kaliya ayaa ka tagay.
And really now.	Oo runtii hadda.
But I can't figure out how to do it.	Laakiin ma awoodo inaan ogaado sida loo sameeyo.
There is nothing we can do.	Wax aan qaban karno ma jiraan.
Anyone can come here.	Qof kasta wuu iman karaa halkan.
They are so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan yihiin.
This is what we can do.	Tani waa waxa aan sameyn karno.
This is a lot of time.	Tani waa waqti aad u badan.
Really this was someone else.	Runtii tani waxay ahayd qof kale.
Little was not so lucky.	Yar ma ahayn nasiib badan.
I doubt it.	Waan ka shakisanahay.
I just looked.	Kaliya waan eegay.
Good stuff here.	Waxyaabo fiican halkan.
I was surprised.	Waan yaabay.
Everyone will be there.	Qof kastaa wuu joogi doonaa halkaas.
It must have been a bad thing.	Waa inay ahayd wax xun.
They do not do the same.	Wax la mid ah ma sameeyaan.
They love him.	Way jecel yihiin isaga.
That was still true.	Taasi wali run bay ahayd.
But he is there.	Laakiin wuu joogaa.
I need that	waan u baahanahay taas
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayo.
Give him time to find out what you are doing.	Sii wakhti uu ku ogaado waxaad samaynayso.
I can't do it	Ma awoodo inaan sameeyo
Probably not the same.	Malaha isku mid maaha.
I do not have time.	Waqti ka hor ma hayo.
It is better than the previous one.	Way ka fiican tahay kan hore.
That is not what we do here.	Taasi maaha waxa aan halkan ku samayno.
And not interesting.	Oo aan xiiso lahayn.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
I will do that	Waan samayn doonaa taas
It should not be.	Waa in aanay noqon.
I think they will find work elsewhere.	Waxaan filayaa inay meel kale shaqo ka heli doonaan.
You can't stop.	Ma joojin kartid.
It was a lot.	Waxay ahayd wax badan.
I looked at that.	Waan eegay taas.
So far she's fine with me.	Ilaa hadda way ila fiican tahay.
I know you are not ready for that yet.	Waan ogahay inaadan weli taas diyaar u ahayn.
I will not do it here.	Halkan kuma yeeli doono.
I put it there.	Halkaas ayaan dhigay.
But this is very fast.	Laakiin tani aad bay u degdeg badan tahay.
But I have a lot.	Laakiin waxaan leeyahay wax badan.
This is what we are.	Tani waa waxa aan nahay.
Clearly, we are.	Si cad, waxaan nahay.
He will find something for you.	Wax buu kuu heli doonaa.
I was surprised by him.	Waan la yaabay isaga.
He is still fine.	Weli wuu fiican yahay.
Not available now.	Hadda lama heli karo.
It was for everyone.	Waxay ahayd qof walba.
I will really see you, really soon.	Runtii waan ku arki doonaa, runtii dhawaan.
I want it to be done well.	Waxaan rabaa in si fiican loo sameeyo.
And other things.	Iyo waxyaabo kale.
I felt the same way.	Waxaan dareemay sidaas oo kale.
It is abandoned.	Waa laga tagay.
But if you do.	Laakiin haddii aad sameyso.
He owns a place.	Meel buu iska leeyahay.
This is still true.	Tani wali waa run.
He tried everything.	Wax walba wuu isku dayay.
If you do too, great.	Haddii aad sidoo kale sameyso, weyn.
We are real.	Waxaan nahay dhab.
If anyone could do it, we would do it.	Haddii qof uu samayn karo, waan samayn lahayn.
There is nowhere to go.	Meel la aado ma jirto.
She will not leave now.	Hadda ma bixi doonto.
Maybe he did.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu sameeyay.
That really is all there is to it.	Taasi runtii waa waxa jira oo dhan.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
Stop that !.	Jooji taas!.
I will probably stay here again.	Waxay u badan tahay inaan halkan mar kale sii joogi doono.
Someone has to want it, to get it.	Qof waa inuu rabaa, si uu u helo.
Please can you tell me about this.	Fadlan ma ii soo sheegi kartaa arrintan.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Wax run ka badan ma noqon karo.
She did something.	Wax bay samaysay.
It was meant to be worked on.	Waxaa la rabay in lagu shaqeeyo.
I have to tell you now.	Waa inaan hadda kuu sheego.
So far, surprisingly.	Ilaa hadda, si yaab leh.
Tomorrow would be a day.	Berrito waxay ahaan lahayd maalin.
This may be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa run.
To be told not to go.	In loo sheego in aanu tagin.
New idea, new idea.	Fikrad cusub, fikrad cusub.
You can do any of them.	Waxaad samayn kartaa wax kasta oo ka mid ah.
He is living now.	Hadda ayuu ku nool yahay.
He went away.	Wuu iska aaday.
People like us.	Dadka nala mid ah.
"I love you," he said.	waan ku jeclahay ayuu yidhi.
He wants to work.	Wuxuu rabaa inuu shaqeeyo.
That's what you say.	Waa waxa aad u sheegto.
I hope everyone is fine.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu wanaagsan yahay.
He knew the next one.	Mid soo socda ayuu ogaa.
No one can leave.	Qofna ma bixi karo.
He did not believe.	Ma uu rumaysan.
Stop to do this.	Jooji si aad tan sameyso.
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
It wasn’t too big.	Ma ahayn wax aad u weyn.
Too much.	Aad u badan.
Maybe he thought it was you.	Malaha wuxuu mooday inuu adiga yahay.
There is urgency.	Waxaa jira degdeg.
Now you will get it.	Hadda waad heli doontaa.
She was told to do it.	Waxa loo sheegay inay samayso.
I thought it would be fast.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay degdeg noqon doonto.
It's really a problem.	Runtii waa dhib.
I really suspect no one really did it to me.	Runtii waxaan ka shakisanahay inuu qofna runtii igu sameeyay.
Well done.	Si wanaagsan ayaa loo sameeyay.
It will be something to do.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax la sameeyo.
I do not find this difficult.	Uma arko tan mid adag.
To and so.	Si iyo sidaas.
Maybe it was too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ahayd mid aad u badan.
This is still not the case.	Tani weli sidii hore maaha.
Everything is clear.	Wax walba waa cad yihiin.
That sounds like one.	Taasi waxay u egtahay mid.
Unknown and unknown.	Lama garanayo oo aan la garanayn.
He came back.	Wuu ku soo noqday.
I'll talk about each one later.	Mid walba mar dambe ayaan ka hadli doonaa.
I can't believe this.	Ma rumaysan karo tan.
I really didn't like it.	Runtii aad uma jeclayn.
Is jecel.	Is jecel.
We can certainly help.	Waa hubaal inaan ku caawin karno.
Now that is a problem.	Hadda taasi waa dhib.
I'm sure it would help	Waan hubaa inay ku caawin lahayd
He did not want to be held in prison again.	Ma uusan rabin in mar kale xabsiga lagu sii hayo.
Great thing really.	Wax weyn runtii.
I can no longer speak.	Ma sii hadli karo.
Something terrible happened.	Waxyaabo aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
I am usually very happy.	Inta badan aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I really found it there.	Runtii waan ka helay halkaas.
As you do now.	Sida aad hadda samaynayso.
Not all are bad.	Ma aha in dhammaan ay xun yihiin.
How to do it.	Sida aad u sameyso.
She did not say how often.	Ma aysan sheegin inta jeer.
No one does, really.	Qofna ma sameeyo, runtii.
Surely tomorrow would have been a better day.	Waxaa hubaal ah in berri ay ahaan lahayd maalin ka wanaagsan.
I would like, one day, to find him.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa, maalin, inaan helo isaga.
He says to me.	Wuu igu leeyahay.
I withdrew from that.	Waan ka noqday taas.
I could not do anything about it.	Waxba waan ka qaban waayay.
This was not a good day.	Tani ma ahayn maalin wanaagsan.
He was here yesterday.	Shalay ayuu halkan joogay.
It's amazing.	Waa yaab.
It will definitely happen.	Waa hubaal inay dhici doonto.
I think so quickly.	Waxaan u maleynayaa si degdeg ah.
Something strange happened to me.	Wax yaab leh ayaa igu dhacay.
This was, one chance.	Tani waxay ahayd, hal fursad.
It looks like a problem.	Waxay u egtahay dhibaato.
And he did this.	Oo tan sameeyay.
He was not here now, but he was everywhere with us.	Hadda meel ma uu joogin, laakiin meel walba wuu nala joogay.
This did not happen.	Tani ma ay samayn.
I wanted to see that.	Waxaan rabay inaan taas arko.
No one is more interesting here.	Ma jiro qof xiiso badan halkan.
I think it's so much better.	Waxay ila tahay inay sidaas ka fiican tahay.
I will do so now.	sidaas ayaan samayn doonaa hadda.
This is similar to work.	Tani waxay la mid tahay shaqada.
What prevented us today?!.	Maxaa noo diiday maanta?!.
I hope you find it interesting.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad ka heli doonto mid xiiso leh.
I looked and looked back at me.	Waan eegay oo dib ii eegay.
But this is not true.	Laakiin tani sax maaha.
I can't take this anymore.	Ma qaadan karo tan mar dambe.
.	.
I wanted to do it.	Waxaan rabay inaan sameeyo.
No one will do it.	Qofna ma yeeli doono.
I got more, too.	Waxaan helay wax ka badan, sidoo kale.
I am ready to speak when you are.	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan hadlo marka aad tahay.
It is always true.	Mar walba waa dhab.
I felt for sure.	Waxaan dareemay hubaal.
But a lot.	Laakiin wax badan.
You cannot leave any job.	Shaqo kasta kama tagi kartid.
I would tell you.	waan kuu sheegi lahaa.
That's what she wants.	Ee waxa ay rabto.
I know you are all there.	Waan ogahay inaad halkaas ku dhan tahay.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
Not very sure.	Aad uma hubo.
I tried this quickly.	Waxaan isku dayay tan si degdeg ah.
It was very difficult to do.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u adag in la sameeyo.
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
He could not leave.	Waa uu bixi waayay.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
But he knew, for sure.	Laakiin wuu ogaa, hubaal.
I knew what would happen.	Waan ogaa waxa dhici doona.
The whole reason and what it is.	Sababta oo dhan iyo waxa ay tahay.
There is always money.	Had iyo jeer waa lacag.
This is probably the worst thing we can do.	Tani waa laga yaabaa inay tahay waxa ugu xun ee aan sameyn karno.
No one wanted to do it.	Qofna ma rabin inuu sameeyo.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii waa in aanay jirin.
But they are very small.	Laakiin aad bay u yar yihiin.
I did not succeed	Ma aan guulaysan
He had that.	Taas buu lahaa.
No one knows what it is.	Qofna ma garanayo waxa uu yahay.
It was really weird and weird.	Runtii waxa ay ahayd wax yaab leh oo yaab leh.
He knew full well that this could not stop him.	Waxa uu si fiican u ogaa in aanay tani waxba joojin karin.
I want to keep working	Waxaan rabaa inaan sii shaqeeyo
A little.	In yar .
Free.	Lacag la'aan.
He is there.	Wuu joogaa.
He is not alone.	Isaga kaliya maaha.
I will not give you any trouble.	Wax dhib ah ku siin maayo.
He is still fine.	Weli wuu fiican yahay.
Very, very close.	Aad iyo aad u dhow.
It was a great idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad aad u weyn.
He has always existed.	Waligiis wuu jiray.
As you were.	Sida aad ahayd.
I know nothing.	Waxba waan ogahay.
He does that every day.	Taas ayuu sameeyaa maalin kasta.
I have been here for over a year.	Waxaan halkan joogay in ka badan hal sano.
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu helay.
Maybe it will help you here.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay halkan ku caawin doonto.
I have to do something.	Waa inaan wax sameeyay.
I don't want to do this.	Anigu ma doonayo inaan tan sameeyo.
I would not say.	Ma odhan lahaa.
They love each other.	Way is jecel yihiin.
You can do this at any time.	Waxaad samayn kartaa tan wakhti kasta.
They are nothing.	Waxay yihiin wax aan ahayn.
How you do it.	Sida aad samaynayso.
No one spoke.	Qofna ma hadlin.
I'm glad you liked it.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaad jeceshahay.
Today was very good.	Maanta waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
And don't tell.	Oo ha sheegin.
No one has time.	Qofna waqti uma hayo.
It is done all the time.	Waa la sameeyaa mar kasta.
Very well done.	Aad ayaa loo sameeyay.
This was now.	Tani waxay ahayd hadda.
Monday will be a new day.	Isniinta waxay noqon doontaa maalin cusub.
He didn't want to, yet.	Ma uusan rabin, weli.
He says.	Wuxuu leeyahay .
It's too bad.	Aad bay u xun tahay.
I've been there a lot.	Wax badan ayaan halkaas joogaa.
how is that ?.	waa sidee taasi?.
I can't stop	Ma joojin karo
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
But he did not come.	Laakiin wuu iman waayay.
I seemed to see it.	Waxaan u muuqday inaan arkay.
That was the reason.	Taasi waxay ahayd sababta.
Unseen.	Arag aan la arag.
They are good at it.	Way ku fiican yihiin.
This is very complicated.	Tani waa mid aad u dhib badan.
This can happen to anyone.	Tani waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta.
I know a lot.	Wax badan ayaan garanayaa.
I do not.	Ma sameeyo.
Luckily, it will go smoothly.	Nasiib kasta, waxay tagi doontaa dhib la'aan.
But not everyone.	Laakiin qof walba ma aha.
There is a man.	Waxaa jira nin.
Like a man out of prison.	Sidii nin xabsiga ka baxay.
People really know me.	Dadka runtii i yaqaan.
To help.	Si loo caawiyo.
You can't stop just one, that's for sure.	Kaliya hal ma joojin kartid, taasi waa hubaal.
I will never do anything.	Wax waligiis yeeli maayo.
I wish he was me.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inuu aniga yahay.
It was a great day for me.	Waxay ii ahayd maalin weyn.
I did not know where.	Meesha maan ogayn.
They love us.	Way na jecel yihiin.
That could be good again.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa mid wanaagsan mar kale.
Even a little.	Xitaa in yar.
She needs it, too.	Waxay u baahan tahay, xitaa.
It looks very interesting.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u xiiso badan.
I don’t see anything else we can do now.	Ma arko wax kale oo aan hadda samayn karno.
Even if he didn’t do it first.	Xitaa haddii uusan markii hore samayn.
Please do not say so.	Fadlan sidaas ha u hadlin.
I don't feel that way.	Ma dareemayo sidaas.
I want her to be there.	Waxaan rabaa inay halkaas joogto.
Someone knew a lot about him.	Qof baa wax badan ka ogaa isaga.
There is nothing new about him.	Ma jiro wax ku cusub isaga.
I would see him.	Waan arki lahaa isaga.
I know, that's bad for me.	Waan ogahay, taasi waa aniga xun.
What would have happened had happened.	Maxaa dhici lahaa ayaa dhacay.
This was difficult for us.	Tani waxay nagu ahayd mid adag.
Otherwise, it will not happen.	Haddii kale, ma dhici doonto.
Nothing.	Waxba ma jiraan.
Something needs to be said.	Wax loo baahan yahay in la sheego.
I will do the same here.	Halkan sidaas oo kale ayaan ku samayn doonaa.
Too much.	Aad iyo aad u badan.
It was so much fun even to eat.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan xitaa inay wax cunto.
You will find it here	Waxaad ka heli doontaa halkan
There is, once and for all.	Waxaa jira, hal mar iyo dhammaan.
I know he will come to you.	Waan ogahay inuu kuu iman doono.
It was something.	Wax bay ahayd.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
I don't know where he got it.	Ma garanayo meel uu ka helay.
And you will tell.	Oo waad sheegi doontaa.
I need to know why.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan ogaado sababta.
I had to be with him, as a friend.	Waxay ahayd inaan isaga la joogo, saaxiib ahaan.
Now it’s the hard one.	Hadda waa kan adag.
It was the best place.	Waxay ahayd meesha ugu fiican.
I have no one here	Qofna kuma hayo halkan
If it is bad.	Haddii uu xun yahay.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha .
He wished it would be better.	Waxa uu jeclaan lahaa in ay fiicnaan lahayd.
There is nothing we can do.	Wax aan qaban karno ma jiraan.
It was tough.	Waxay ahayd mid adag.
Like the person after.	Sida qofka ka dib.
That would happen.	Taas oo kale ayaa dhici lahayd.
This is where you are now.	Tani waa meesha aad hadda joogto.
I was there	waan joogay
Not caught.	Lama qaban.
A lot has happened.	Wax badan ayaa dhacay.
I can always stop there.	Had iyo jeer waan ku joojin karaa halkaas.
You don't need it anymore.	Uma baahnid mar dambe.
He didn't have to.	Ma ahayn inuu sameeyo.
I really need to go	Runtii waxaan u baahanahay inaan tago
He bought them one by one.	Mid mid buu u iibsaday.
It's amazing how little a man needs food.	Waxaa la yaab leh sida yar ee nin u baahan yahay cunto.
There is really nothing interesting.	Dhab ahaantii wax xiiso leh ma jirto.
Everything is known.	Wax kasta oo la yaqaan.
To do better things.	Si aad u sameyso waxyaabo ka fiican.
Everything is there.	Wax walba waa jiraan.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi kaliya maaha.
There is not much you can do about it.	Ma jiraan wax badan oo aad arrintan ka qaban karto.
There was something terrible.	Waxaa jiray wax aad u xun.
That was a beautiful thing you did.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aad u qurux badan oo aad u samaysay.
I know it would help me.	Waan ogahay inay i caawin lahayd.
I came out.	Waan ka soo baxay.
It’s a lot we do.	Waa wax aad u badan oo aan samayno.
But after a while.	Laakiin muddo ka dib.
When everything is too much.	Marka wax walba ay aad u badan yihiin.
That is great.	Taasi waa mid aad u weyn.
He told them to do the same.	Wuxuu u sheegay inay sidaas oo kale sameeyaan.
I took it.	waan qaatay.
There is something for everyone.	Qof walba wax baa u jira.
It was so.	Waxay ahayd sidaas.
She would love to.	Waxay jeclaan lahayd.
That would be a good thing to do.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd wax fiican in la sameeyo.
I think it's a very bad idea.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay fikrad aad u xun.
This is nothing new.	Tani ma aha wax cusub.
I love him	waan jeclahay isaga
I can talk about everything.	Wax walba waan kala hadli karaa.
Something has delayed him so far.	Wax baa isaga dib u dhigay ilaa hadda.
He is an adult.	Waa qof weyn.
He is a tough guy.	Waa nin adag.
It should not have been so.	Ma ahayn in sidaas la sameeyo.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
But that was so far.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd ilaa hadda.
But I will get it.	Laakiin waan heli doonaa.
Now busy.	Hadda mashquul.
I am very happy.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay.
Don't stop a friend.	Ha joojin saaxiib.
I just took it.	Kaliya waan ka qaaday.
So far there is nothing he does not like.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax uusan jeclayn.
Let him say what he says.	Ha sheego wuxuu leeyahay.
Very clear.	Aad u cad .
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
Very, very.	Aad iyo aad runtii.
But he is still unlucky.	Laakiin weli nasiib ma leh.
Don't love me.	Ha i jeclayn.
I did a bit of that.	Waan sameeyay xoogaa in.
But nothing real has happened yet.	Laakiin ma jirin wax dhab ah oo ku dhacay weli.
They are smart.	Waa caqli badan yihiin.
You will get the whole place.	Waxaad heli doontaa meesha oo dhan.
I have never been like that.	Weligay maan ahaan sidaas oo kale.
When he certainly did not.	Markii uu hubaal ma samayn.
He is very smart.	Aad buu u caqli badan yahay.
And going fast.	Oo si degdeg ah u socda.
There is something to be said for this.	Waxaa jira wax loo sheego tan.
It was nothing.	Waxba ma ahayn.
He has nothing new to say.	Ma jiro wax uu sheego oo cusub.
Everyone looked.	Qof kastaa wuu eegay.
Something happened to him.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
We need that so much.	Waxaan u baahanahay taas si aad u weyn.
In fact, she prefers it.	Dhab ahaantii, way ka sii jeceshahay.
Sure, that's worse.	Hubaal, taasi way ka xun tahay.
But it never came out.	Laakiin waligiis ma soo bixin.
A lot, even.	Wax badan, xitaa.
That is the only thing a person like me can do.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee qofka aniga oo kale ah sameyn karo.
We felt it again.	Mar kale ayaa nala dareemay.
I can't do that.	Taas ma samayn karo.
So, if nothing else.	Marka, haddii aysan jirin wax kale.
You will see no problem here.	Waxaad ku arki doontaa wax dhibaato ah halkan.
But at home.	Laakiin guriga.
He is very big on that.	Aad ayuu ugu weyn yahay taas.
To be present as and everything.	Inaad u joogto sida iyo wax walba.
What a great idea.	Waa maxay fikrad fiican.
It was real.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah.
I think this is really great.	Waxaan filayaa in tani runtii tahay mid aad u fiican.
But work is still work.	Laakiin shaqo weli waa shaqo.
Very much so.	Aad bay u .
Why do they live there.	Waa maxay sababta ay halkaas ugu nool yihiin.
No one has to do it alone.	Qofna waa inuu keligiis sameeyo.
I could not stay here.	Halkan ma joogi karin.
They may be for you too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay sidoo kale adiga kuu yihiin.
That, he did not succeed.	Taas, kuma uu guulaysan.
It can't be otherwise.	Si kale ma noqon karo.
As you love me.	Sida aad ii jeceshahay.
I had one	Mid baan lahaa
No problem, no more.	Dhib ma leh, mar dambe ma aha.
He seemed to know everything.	Wuxuu u muuqday inuu wax walba garanayo.
He is very back.	Aad buu u soo noqday.
Please tell us what you need.	Fadlan noo sheeg waxaad u baahan tahay.
That's the way it is.	Waa sida ay tahay.
I was here every day.	maalin kasta ayaan halkan joogay.
No one is here.	Qofna halkan ma joogo.
If it felt great.	Haddii la dareemay weyn.
Everyone has heard of me before.	Qof kastaa mar hore ayuu iga maqlay.
This is untrue.	Tani waa wax aan run ahayn.
It's too early.	Waa hore.
To like this.	Si aad tan u rabto.
well done.	si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay.
That was the only way he did it.	Taasi waxay ahayd sida kaliya ee uu ku sameeyay.
He is a beautiful man.	Waa nin qurux badan.
This is not the case.	Tani maaha taas.
This can take time.	Tani waxay qaadan kartaa wakhti.
I need to talk to him.	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan la hadlo isaga.
It would be talked about a bit.	Waa laga hadli lahaa xoogaa.
He is so much better than that.	Aad ayuu uga fiican yahay taas.
Most are left out.	Inta badan waa laga tagay.
Everything is happy.	Wax walba waa faraxsan yihiin.
First of all, it is beautiful.	Marka hore, way qurux badan tahay.
I would still go	Wali waan tagi lahaa
Now it is, too.	Hadda waa, sidoo kale.
In fact, less than three years.	Dhab ahaantii, in ka yar saddex sano.
I like to eat food.	Waxaan jeclahay inaan cuno cunto.
But it also needs to know more than that.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay u baahan tahay in la ogaado wax ka badan taas.
I am ready to go anywhere	Waxaan diyaar u ahay inaan aado meel kasta
John was present.	Yooxanaa wuu joogay.
There is nothing surprising.	Ma jiro wax la yaab leh.
Maybe there is something true about what you have.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan wax run ah waxa aad leedahay.
He was.	Waxa uu ahaa.
This can be very, very bad.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aad iyo aad u xun.
I didn't even want to talk to him.	Xitaa maan rabin inaan la hadlo.
I knew what it would be like.	Waan ogaa sida ay noqon doonto.
I thought of him.	Waxaan u maleeyay isaga.
He felt he had to say more.	Waxa uu dareemay in uu wax badan sheego.
No one came out of me.	Qofna igama soo bixin.
They had no intention of making money.	Wax niyad ah uma ay lahayn inay lacag sameeyaan.
It was amazing.	Waxay ahayd yaab.
She will see you.	Way ku arki doontaa.
And always has been.	Oo had iyo jeer ahaa.
I may even have seen this before.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan xitaa tan hore u arkay.
That should be sufficient enough for him.	Taas ayaa ku filan isaga.
It belongs to me.	Aniga ayaa iska leh.
I can tell him to do it.	Waxaan u sheegi karaa inuu sameeyo.
I didn't want him to know me.	Maan rabin inuu i ogaado.
No one was talking.	Qofna lama hadli jirin.
They are among the people.	Waxay ka mid yihiin dadka.
What, it is.	Waa maxay, waa.
There are things to do	Waxaa jira waxyaabo shaqo
I do not know how.	Ma garanayo sida.
She is good there	Way ku fiican tahay halkaas
He said he did.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu sameeyay.
To do something with it is another.	In wax lagu sameeyo waa mid kale.
It can only be him.	Waxay noqon kartaa oo kaliya isaga.
You can't talk about it.	Ma ka hadli kartid.
But he did not like it.	Laakiin ma uu jeclayn.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
I never thought he was bad.	Waligiis uma malaynayn inuu xun yahay.
This is not the right place.	Tani maaha meel sax ah.
It may not happen, but it really is.	Ma dhici karto, laakiin dhab ahaantii waa.
That is the only thing to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee jira in la ogaado.
You may do this correctly.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad taas si sax ah u sameyso.
But there may be several.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inay jiraan dhowr.
What happened to us?	Maxaa dhib nagu dhacay.
Immediately after such a problem.	Isla ka dib markii ay dhibaato sida.
This is true.	Tani waa run.
But you can't stay.	Laakiin ma joogi kartid.
I had to get a job.	Waxay ahayd in aan shaqo helo.
No one really knows what this will be like.	Runtii qofna ma garanayo waxa ay tani noqon doonto.
There is no better way to do it.	Ma jirto si ka fiican oo loo sameeyo.
Bad, bad, friend.	Xun, xun, saaxiib.
I am so happy to see you again.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan mar kale ku arko.
It was money tonight.	Caawa lacag buu ahaa.
But not everyone is lucky.	Laakiin qof kastaa maaha mid nasiib badan.
There is something to be done.	Waxaa jira wax la sameeyo.
They will say something.	Wax bay odhan doonaan.
I'm sorry about that.	Waan ka xumahay tan.
I'm very happy.	Aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
Today he is scared.	Maanta wuu ka baqayaa.
She still refuses to leave school.	Wali way diiday in uu dugsiga ka tago.
No problem, either.	Dhib ma jiraan, sidoo kale.
You can talk, you can talk, you can talk.	Waad hadli kartaa, waad hadli kartaa, waad hadli kartaa.
He used to cook for me.	Wuu ii karin jiray.
Exactly, maybe.	Si sax ah, malaha.
I wanted to pick it up.	Waxaan rabay inaan soo qaado.
Certainly not all.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha dhammaan.
He was lucky, he knew.	Nasiib buu lahaa, wuu ogaa.
he could not.	wuu awoodi waayay.
But he is really good.	Laakiin runtii wuu fiican yahay.
Both are true.	Labaduba waa run.
He has to stay home.	Waa inuu guriga joogo.
I can't do anything.	waxba ma samayn karo.
There was something they didn't like.	Waxaa jiray wax aysan jeclayn.
No one saw it.	Cidna ma arag.
I did not want to continue working there.	Ma rabin in aan halkaas ka sii shaqeeyo.
I didn't get a job today.	Maanta shaqo uma soo bixin.
I can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban karo.
He wanted to be true to you.	Wuxuu rabay inuu run kuu noqdo.
It's beautiful	Waa qurux badan
Here we are again, already.	Halkan waxaan mar kale, mar hore.
And close friends.	Iyo saaxiibo dhow.
I don't want you to do that.	Ma rabo inaad taas samayso.
She looks like a good enough man.	Waxay u egtahay nin ku filan oo fiican.
I'm sure he can help you.	Waan hubaa inuu ku caawin karo.
Something will come of it.	Wax baa ka iman doona.
He was so ugly and so big.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xun oo isla weyn.
I can tell you this.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa tan.
I will not return.	soo noqon maayo.
There were several other people present.	Waxaa joogay dhowr qof oo kale.
Here, hold this.	Halkan, tan ku qabo.
But it is a good lie.	Laakiin waa been wanaagsan.
Why did it happen and say you can get it.	Sababta ayuu u dhacay oo yidhi waad heli kartaa.
What a place.	Maxaa meel ah.
I was for it.	Waxaan u ahaa.
Nothing else was found	Waa la heli waayay wax kale
If you are still at school,.	Haddii aad weli dugsiga joogto,.
It is very good.	Aad bay u fiican tahay.
Someone else had to find out.	Waxay ahayd in qof kale uu taas ogaado.
They are not friends to me.	Ma ahan saaxiibo aniga.
I will win.	Waan guulaysan doonaa.
It's amazing, it's amazing.	Waa yaab, waa yaab.
He is very happy.	Aad ayuu u faraxsan yahay.
He got into a lot of trouble.	Dhibaato badan ayuu galay.
I don't know, really.	Ma garanayo, dhab ahaantii.
Maybe he would be all there.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu halkaas joogi lahaa oo dhan.
So far nothing has come of it.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax ka soo baxay.
That was really, really the best thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd runtii, runtii waxa ugu wanaagsan.
She needs to know.	Waxay u baahan tahay inay ku ogaato.
Can you do something if you want ?.	Ma samayn kartaa wax haddii aad rabto?.
That's what happened yesterday.	Waa wixii shalay dhacay.
I think he did well, really.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu si fiican u sameeyay, dhab ahaantii.
How are you.	Sidee tahay.
To break up and come back.	In la kala tago oo la soo noqdo.
Obviously, it is very rare.	Sida iska cad, aad bay u yar tahay.
I can't find that.	Taas ma heli karo.
This is not something new.	Ma aha in tani ay tahay wax cusub.
There was so much.	Wax badan baa jiray.
This is what we do here.	Tani waa waxa aan halkan ku samayno.
But, that's what he told me.	Laakiin, taasi waa waxa uu ii sheegay.
I do not know what to do	Ma garanayo waxaan sameeyo
I will definitely leave now.	Runtii hadda waan bixi doonaa.
He fell hard.	Si adag ayuu u dhacay.
No one arrested me.	Qofna ima qaban.
I hope everyone.	Waxaan rajeynayaa qof walba.
But several people did.	Laakiin dhowr qof ayaa sameeyay.
I am ready to do that	diyaar ayaan u ahay inaan taas sameeyo
You lied about everything.	Wax walba been baad ka sheegtay.
Maybe I do someone else.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan qof kale sameeyo.
He stays in place.	Meesha ayuu iska joogaa.
I think he is in prison.	Waxaan u malaynayaa in uu yahay xabsiga.
It is very small.	Aad bay u yar tahay.
This will take time.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
That will not do.	Taasi ma yeeli doonto.
I am a bit busy.	Waxaan ahay xoogaa mashquul ah.
I looked	Waan eegay
Maybe there were a few of these.	Malaha waxaa jiray dhowr tan.
This is true and not often discussed.	Tani waa run oo aan inta badan laga hadlin.
I think he hopes.	Waxaan filayaa inuu rajaynayo.
Take three of us.	Saddex noo qaado.
I have a great time.	Waxaan ku leeyahay waqti weyn.
He was really surprised.	Runtii wuu yaabay.
You can be a person.	Waxaad noqon kartaa qof.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u dhib badan tahay.
I asked her to help me.	Waxaan ka codsaday inay i caawiso.
I can't even do that.	Xitaa taas ma sameyn karo.
I did not see one coming.	Maan arag mid soo socda.
I can't afford a new car.	Ma awoodi karo baabuur cusub.
This is how it should work.	Tani waa sida ay tahay in la shaqeeyo.
And there is more.	Oo wax badan ayaa jira.
No idea has come to him yet.	Weli wax fikrad ah uma iman isaga.
Surprisingly, the better.	La yaab leh, ka wanaagsan.
She knows that now more than ever.	Way ogtahay taas hadda in ka badan sidii hore.
But she didn't.	Laakiin ma aysan haysan.
Now you know.	Hadda waad ogaatay.
But the other one is also good.	Laakiin kan kale ayaa sidoo kale fiican.
It includes.	Waxaa ka mid ah.
This is not a problem.	Tani maaha dhibaato.
He is bigger than us.	Wuu naga weyn yahay.
I was not ready for that.	Diyaar uma ahayn taas.
She did not want to be found.	Ma ay rabin in la helo.
It is not just what it is.	Waxba ma aha oo kaliya waxa ay tahay.
I don't want one to do that.	Anigu mid ma rabo inaan taas sameeyo.
Obviously this is so.	Sida cad tani waa sidaas.
I still don't have it today.	Wali ma hayo maanta.
He started again.	Mar kale ayuu bilaabay.
I'm sure he is.	Waan hubaa inuu yahay.
There was little.	Wax yar baa jiray.
There was nothing wrong with him.	Ma jirin wax isaga ah.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ma garanayo waxa aan ka sameeyo.
I want to do other things.	Waxaan rabaa inaan sameeyo waxyaabo kale.
Now, less.	Hadda, in ka yar.
In fact, he is a good man.	Dhab ahaantii, waa nin wanaagsan.
It was not a lie.	Been ma ahayn.
Need after everything else.	Baahan wax kasta oo kale ka dib.
I will also need more than that.	Waxaan sidoo kale u baahan doonaa wax ka badan taas.
I want to be with you, tonight.	Waxaan rabaa inaan kula joogo, caawa.
There is nothing else that anyone can love.	Ma jiro wax kale oo uu qof ku jeclaan karo.
I want to talk to you	waxaan rabaa inaan kula hadlo
It is also very accurate.	Waxa kale oo aad u sax ah.
But he was a good man.	Laakiin nin wanaagsan buu ahaa.
It was me before.	Waxay ahayd aniga hore.
Everyone thinks you can do more.	Qof kastaa wuxuu qabaa inaad wax badan qaban karto.
I can't agree	Ma ogolaan karo
He was very interesting.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
Much before.	In badan ka hor.
You can see it here.	Waxaad ka arki kartaa halkan.
It could not be found.	Waa la heli waayay.
This may not be true.	Tani run ma noqon karto.
There were three people in the room.	Qolka waxaa joogay saddex qof.
I'm sure.	waan hubaa.
No idea.	Wax fikrad ah ma jirto.
Obviously not.	Waxa iska cad in aanay ahayn.
It is me.	Waa aniga.
I am not one.	Anigu mid maaha.
And he wants to know.	Oo wuxuu rabaa inuu ogaado.
It was no longer.	Mar dambe ma ahayn.
Only what is needed.	Kaliya waxa loo baahan yahay.
It is who we are and what we do.	Waa cidda aan nahay iyo waxa aan samayno.
I know what she told me.	Waan garanayaa waxay ii sheegtay.
The first to come.	Kii hore u iman lahaa.
That is good to know.	Taasi way wanaagsan tahay in la ogaado.
I felt with him.	Waxaan la dareemay isaga.
Everything turned out well.	Wax walba ayaa si fiican u soo baxay.
What it really is.	Waa maxay run ahaantii.
That's what they don't like.	Taasi waa waxa aanay jeclayn.
It was for him.	Waxay u ahayd isaga.
Now it was fun.	Hadda waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
This is all small.	Tani waa wax yar oo dhan.
I was really impressed.	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay.
He was asked to leave.	Waxaa laga codsaday inuu baxo.
It's harder than that.	Way ka adag tahay taas.
Now you must.	Hadda waa inaad.
I want you to know how we do things.	Waxaan rabaa inaad ogaato sida aan wax u samayno.
I also didn’t help.	Sidoo kale ma aanan caawin.
That is an urgent task.	Taasi waa shaqo degdeg ah.
This was an exciting day for me.	Tani waxay ii ahayd maalin xiiso badan.
I tried to stay with him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la joogo.
We probably wouldn’t.	Waxay u badan tahay inaan sameyn lahayn.
What a bad place.	Waa maxay meel xun.
I wanted to be there.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaas joogo.
But she did.	Laakiin way samaysay.
I am not the only one talking about this.	Ma ihi ka kaliya ee aan ka hadlo arrintan.
We can't do anything about what happened to us.	Waxba kama yeeli karno wixii nagu dhacay.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I will be for a while.	Waxaan ahaan doonaa xoogaa waqti ah.
He didn't need to do that.	Uma baahnayn inuu sidaas sameeyo.
This is the best thing we can do.	Tani waa waxa ugu fiican ee aan sameyn karno.
And wanting that doesn't matter.	Iyo in la rabo taas dhib malaha.
I would stop	waan joojin lahaa
All we need now is time.	Waxa kaliya ee aan hadda u baahanahay waa waqti.
It was supposed to include.	Waxa la rabay in uu ku jiro.
Maybe he knows now.	Malaha wuu garanayaa hadda.
I doubt they will do anything better than that.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay inay samayn doonaan wax ka wanaagsan taas.
He can really do it, and do it well.	Waxa uu dhab ahaantii samayn karo, oo si fiican u qaban karo.
It's really amazing.	Runtii waa yaab.
There is nothing there.	Waxba meesha ma jiraan.
Maybe she has.	Malaha waxay leedahay.
There is also no such thing.	Sidoo kale ma jiro wax la mid ah.
But nothing to see.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax la arko.
But no one really does.	Laakiin qofna runtii ma sameeyo.
It looks like a lot.	Waxay u egtahay wax badan.
It is work.	Waa shaqada.
She was just like me.	Waxay ila mid ahayd aniga oo kale.
That is very difficult.	Taasi aad bay u adag tahay.
But there were several other times.	Laakiin waxaa jiray dhowr jeer oo kale.
That was what was to be done.	Taas oo ahayd waxa la rabay in la sameeyo.
Maybe she did something good.	Waxa laga yaabaa inay wax wanaagsan samaysay.
I started to wonder.	Waxaan bilaabay inaan la yaabanahay.
No one wanted to be there.	Qofna ma rabin inuu halkaas joogo.
But not much.	Laakiin ma badna.
There is so much more to do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo kale oo la sameeyo.
We were really close friends.	Runtii waxaan ahayn saaxiibo dhow.
I don't know how to do anything else.	Ma garanayo sida wax kale loo sameeyo.
It really is everything.	Runtii waa wax walba.
It will be the right thing to do.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax sax ah.
I know that not everyone is able to do this.	Waan ogahay in qof walba uusan awoodin inuu tan sameeyo.
You do not charge a fee at first.	Marka hore wax lacag ah ma qaado.
It's hard for me to leave.	Way igu adag tahay inaan baxo.
I know you have one.	Waan ogahay inaad mid leedahay.
That is hard to do, after all.	Taasi waa adag tahay in la sameeyo, ka dib oo dhan.
I know they don't need me.	Waan ogahay in aanay ii baahnayn.
Not only for a long time.	Kaliya maaha muddo dheer.
That may be.	Taasi waa laga yaabaa.
do you have.	ma leedahay .
Maybe I still have a few.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan weli haysto dhowr.
I always did.	Mar walba waan samayn jiray.
I was very busy	mashquul badan ayaan ahaa
And heard.	Oo maqlay.
That will always be true.	Taasi mar walba run bay ahaan doontaa.
Not too long ago.	Ma aad u dheer ka hor.
This is the best.	Tani waa ugu fiican.
Good thing too.	Wax fiican sidoo kale.
It was so big and white and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u weyn oo cad oo qurux badan.
Before you arrive.	Inta aadan iman.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
Other than that, there is nothing else to really say.	Wax kale oo aan ahayn, ma jiraan wax kale oo runtii wax laga sheego.
Maybe he has.	Malaha wuu leeyahay.
He had no back.	Dib uma lahayn.
It will not be soon.	Mar dhow ma noqon doonto.
Don't help me.	Ha i caawin.
There was no other similar.	Wax kale oo la mid ah ma jirin.
Probably a lot of them.	Malaha wax badan oo ka mid ah.
It was the best thing she could do now.	Waxay ahayd waxa ugu wanaagsan ee ay hadda samayn karto.
And no problem.	Oo dhib ma leh.
Wherever she would be.	Meel kasta oo ay joogi lahayd.
Now, you probably have to stay here another day.	Hadda, waxay u badan tahay inay tahay inaad halkan sii joogto maalin kale.
You will see that.	Waad arki doontaa taas.
I know .	Waan ogahay .
you are good here	halkan ayaad ku fiican tahay
And there.	Iyo halkaas.
One more time please.	Hal mar oo kale fadlan.
She was right.	Run bay sheegtay.
I don't have time for that.	Waqti uma hayo taas.
Each one.	Mid kasta .
It wasn’t always right.	Ma ahayn mid sax ah mar walba.
Since, there is a lot to come.	Tan, waxaa jira wax badan oo soo socda.
I am a very good man.	Waxaan ahay nin aad u fiican.
I really know this.	Runtii waan ogahay tan.
He just doesn’t want to work hard.	Kaliya ma rabo inuu si adag u shaqeeyo.
He knew he had nothing to do with it now.	Wuu ogaa in aanu hadda waxba ka haysan.
That is more than enough.	Taasi waa wax ka badan oo ku filan.
But, maybe.	Laakiin, malaha.
I came out the other way.	Si kale ayaan u soo baxay.
Until you get there.	Ilaa aad halkaas joogto.
But now she is better than all.	Laakiin hadda way ka fiican tahay dhammaan.
I told him most of the time.	Inta badan ayaan u sheegay.
What to do, what to do.	Maxaa la sameeyaa, maxaa la sameeyaa.
I love work	Waan jeclahay shaqada
I hope you do nothing about it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaadan waxba ka qaban.
I'm glad he decided to stay.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inuu go'aansaday inuu joogo.
This can be true.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa runtii.
Something happened.	Wax baa dhacay.
I need it	waan u baahanahay
It will help you.	Way ku caawin doontaa.
I wanted to keep it here.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaan ku sii hayo.
He would pay for everything.	Wax kasta wuu bixin lahaa.
That’s exactly right, really.	Taasi waa sax sax ah, dhab ahaantii.
I am really sorry about this.	Runtii waan ka xumahay arrintan.
There is a problem.	Halkaas waxaa ka jira dhibaato.
She did not speak.	Ma aysan hadlin.
But that is now, and now.	Laakiin taasi waa hadda, iyo hadda.
I am a man.	Nin baan ahay.
I am something else.	Waxaan ahay wax kale.
He was lucky.	Nasiib buu lahaa.
Everyone else is ready to go.	Qof kasta oo kale ayaa diyaar u ah inuu tago.
No one is in it.	Ma jiro qof ku jira.
If she was lucky, she would not come back.	Haddii ay nasiib leedahay, dib uma soo noqon lahayn.
After all, we are more than you.	Ka dib oo dhan, waanu kaa badan nahay.
It was a real strike as well.	Waxay ahayd shaqo joojin sax ah sidoo kale.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
But, it really is not.	Laakiin, run ahaantii maaha.
Everyone but.	Qof walba laakiin .
He rejected me.	Wuu i diiday.
This is not difficult.	Tani ma aha mid adag.
I have to leave	Waa inaan baxo
I don't think he can do it.	Uma maleynayo inuu sameyn karo.
There is nothing else we can do until tomorrow.	Ma jirto wax kale oo aan sameyn karno ilaa berri.
I think you would love him.	Waxaan filayaa inaad isaga jeclaan lahayd.
As well as you.	Iyo sidoo kale adiga.
As she should tell.	Sida ay tahay inay u sheegto.
I should not have left the room with him.	Ma ahayn in aan qolka ka soo tago isaga.
It is new.	Waa cusub.
But he really got into it.	Laakiin runtii wuu galay.
He was very impressed.	Aad ayuu ula dhacay.
She had people.	Waxay lahayd dadka .
Not sure what they are.	Ma hubo waxa ay yihiin.
was asked.	ayaa la waydiiyay.
It was a great time to work together, too.	Waxay ahayd wakhti aad u fiican oo la wada shaqeeyo, sidoo kale.
He did it from time to time.	Mar iyo mar ayuu sameeyay.
I think she had.	Waxaan filayaa inay lahayd.
He refused.	Taas wuu diiday.
This is just me.	Tani waa aniga kaliya.
This is not the case.	Tani maaha, hadda maaha.
I think I need a lot more of this.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaan u baahanahay wax badan oo tan ah.
I wanted him to stay.	Waxaan rabay inuu joogo.
There is something else at work.	Wax kale ayaa ku jira shaqada.
You know it is.	Waad ogtahay inay tahay.
He went back.	Dib buu u noqday.
And not just me.	Oo aniga kaliya maaha.
Wherever she is.	Meel kasta oo ay joogto.
I don't understand how it is here.	Ma fahmin sida ay tahay halkan.
Everyone should do that.	Qof walba waa inuu taas sameeyaa.
I wanted to go home.	Waxa aan rabay in aan guriga aado.
That's right, but very difficult.	Waa sax, laakiin aad u dhib badan.
He is alive.	Waa nool yahay.
He will do it.	Wuu samayn doonaa.
It was not the same.	Waxba isku mid ma ahayn.
He hopes no one can see him.	Wuxuu rajeynayaa in qofna uusan arki karin.
I need to be there	Waxaan u baahanahay inaan halkaas joogo
First of all, they are very good.	Marka hore, aad bay u fiican yihiin.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
Everyone else is missing.	Qof kasta oo kale waa la waayay.
Has a car	Leeyahay baabuur
You just look so good.	Kaliya waxaad u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
It will be seen.	Waa la arki doonaa.
Everyone definitely has something.	Qof kastaa hubaal wax buu leeyahay.
That's good, man.	Taasi waa wax fiican, nin.
It will be beautiful.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid qurux badan.
How can that happen.	Sidee u dhici karaa .
But it was right, you know.	Laakiin sax bay ahayd, waad ogtahay.
Maybe he knows.	Malaha wuu garanayaa.
But it is enough.	Laakiin way ku filan tahay.
He was not a happy man.	Ma ahayn nin faraxsan.
But no one was there.	Laakiin qofna ma jirin.
I wonder who is the best.	Waxaan la yaabanahay yaa ugu fiican.
There is always tomorrow.	Mar walba waxaa jira berri.
Until she was ready.	Ilaa ay diyaar u ahayd.
This is not all.	Tan kaliya maaha.
What would you tell me.	Maxaad ii sheegi lahayd.
It's the same problem.	Waa isku dhib.
I will not go	Ma tagi doono
I can really say that.	Run ahaantii taas ayaan odhan karaa.
Like, really long.	Sida, runtii dheer.
Probably true.	Run baa laga yaabaa.
But similar to this.	Laakiin la mid ah tan.
He was very upset.	Aad buu uga noqday.
I only got one chance.	Hal fursad oo kaliya ayaan helay.
It can be very difficult.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid aad u dhib badan.
They are, here and there.	Waxay yihiin, halkan iyo halkaas.
Maybe I don't understand.	Malaha maan fahmin.
She had, several times.	Waxay lahayd, dhowr jeer.
They are all the same.	Dhammaan waa isku mid.
He is a difficult person to learn.	Waa qof ay adag tahay in la barto.
That is who we are.	Taasi waa dadka aan nahay.
She was not with him.	Ma la joogin isaga.
It was something but not much.	Waxay ahayd wax laakiin ma ahayn wax badan.
This was as it was.	Tani waxay ahayd sidii ay ahayd.
It was a difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag.
He was very clear about what he was feeling.	Waxa uu ahaa mid aad u cad cad waxa uu dareemayo.
All very well.	Dhammaan aad iyo aad u wanaagsan.
Everything is for sure.	Wax walba waa hubaal.
He looked good.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid wanaagsan.
him.	isaga .
You would do the same for each of us.	Waxaad sidaas oo kale u samayn lahayd qof kasta oo naga mid ah.
It will be amazing	Waxay noqon doontaa yaab
He thought that would happen.	Wuxuu mooday inay taasi dhici doonto.
You will do well.	Waxaad samayn doontaa si fiican.
One whole and all one.	Mid dhan iyo dhammaan hal.
Maybe she had something to do with it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay halkaas wax ku lahayd.
He never saw her again.	Mar dambe ma uu arag.
I think that's a good thing.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay wax wanaagsan.
This would be bad.	Tani waxay ahaan lahayd mid xun.
Not right.	Sax maaha.
It was later.	Waxay ahayd markii dambe.
But he could not leave.	Laakiin wuu ka tagi waayay.
I’m not sure anyone does.	Ma hubo in qofna sameeyo.
He had enough time.	Wuxuu lahaa waqti ku filan.
It doesn't matter.	Waxba maaha.
It is the same everywhere.	Waa sidaas oo kale meel walba.
Today was great.	Maanta waxay ahayd mid weyn.
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
I can't take it seriously.	Wax dhab ah uma qaadan karo.
Even if you don’t like it now.	Xitaa haddii aadan hadda ku jeclayn.
I just couldn't take it.	Kaliya waan qaadan waayay.
I have to.	Waa inaan aniga ahay.
I've tried it before.	Mar hore ayaan isku dayay.
But he is very beautiful.	Laakiin aad ayuu u qurux badan yahay.
It can't be anything else.	Wax kale ma noqon karo.
I do nothing else.	Wax kale ma sameeyo.
So he could not see anything.	Sidaas ayuu waxba ku arki waayay.
After all, everyone looks great.	Ka dib oo dhan, qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa mid aad u fiican.
A few others are missing.	In yar oo kale oo waa la waayay.
love you back.	dib kuu jecel.
I got a lot of time.	Waxaan helay waqti badan.
I don't even like him.	Xitaa isaga ma jecli.
I know how it is.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay.
Please do not comment on this.	Fadlan waa inaadan waxba ka odhan arrintan.
There is nothing he can do to help.	Ma jiro wax uu ku caawin karo.
Tell me that again.	Taas ii sheeg mar kale.
Tell me what to do now.	Ii sheeg waxa aan sameeyo hadda.
He didn't want her to know that.	Ma aha inuu rabay inay taas ogaato.
Everyone does.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
I will stay here	Halkan ayaan joogi doonaa
I'm sure it will help.	Waan hubaa inuu ku caawin doono.
I suspect this also exists.	Waxaan ka shakisanahay in tani ay sidoo kale jirto.
I still don't know.	Wali ma garanayo.
This is the biggest.	Tani waa tan ugu weyn.
He did a great one.	Mid weyn ayuu sameeyay.
It just wouldn’t do.	Kaliya ma ahayn mid samayn lahaa.
One could not say that.	Mid ayaa taas sheegi waayay.
It is not a car.	Ma aha baabuur.
I really enjoyed it.	Aad ayaan uga helay.
She looks like a man.	Waxay u egtahay nin.
I like to recap.	Waxaan jeclahay in aan dib u hadlo.
She's worse than she really does.	Way ka xun tahay inay runtii sameyso.
No problem, he said.	Dhib malaha ayuu yidhi.
That is what you can say.	Taasi waa waxa aad ka odhan karto.
What else did you do, you did.	Maxaa kale oo aad samaysay, waad samaysay.
As it is called good food.	Sida loo yaqaan cunto wanaagsan.
It will go	Way tagi doontaa
And if you need something done, it's done.	Oo haddii aad u baahan tahay wax la sameeyo, waa la sameeyay.
It would be nice if you could be there.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii aad halkaas joogi karto.
But we can't take anything.	Laakiin waxba ma qaadan karno.
That just can’t be.	Kaliya taasi ma noqon karto.
She said something to herself.	Wax bay isku tidhi.
I found it there	Waan ka helay halkaas
I wish you luck.	Nasiib ayaan kuu rajeynayaa.
I haven't spoken yet.	Weli ma hadlin.
This was not surprising.	Tani ma ahayn wax la yaab leh.
I really refused that.	Runtii taas waan diiday.
It was long and beautiful.	Waxay ahayd mid dheer oo qurux badan.
Even more busy than I am.	Xitaa iga mashquul badan.
Now I got it.	Hadda waan helay.
You will love it so much.	Aad ayaad u jeclaan doontaa wax badan.
This is a very interesting idea.	Tani waa fikrad aad u xiiso badan.
But he decided to tell her.	Laakiin wuxuu go'aansaday inuu u sheego.
But still a good idea.	Laakiin weli fikrad fiican.
It has to be bigger than that.	Waa in ay ka weyn tahay taas.
That's right.	Waa sax.
tell me what you want.	ii sheeg waxaad rabto.
It cannot be the same.	Isku mid ma noqon karo.
He said I love it.	Wuxuu yiri waan jeclahay.
I still haven't found it	Wali ma helin
There is nothing wrong with that, but it is beautiful.	Ma jiraan wax xun oo lagu sameeyo halkaas, laakiin waa qurux.
I just didn’t get it.	Kaliya ma aan helin.
I love doing that	Waxaan jeclahay inaan taas sameeyo
You are lucky.	Nasiib baad tahay.
I did not go	ma tagin
What happened to him?	Maxaa ku dhacay isaga?.
I just need to see you	Kaliya waxaan u baahanahay inaan ku arko
One closer.	Mid ka dhow.
He had to figure out how that could happen.	Waxay ahayd inuu ogaado sida ay taasi u dhici karto.
It was friend to friend, man to man.	Waxay ahayd saaxiib ilaa saaxiib, nin ilaa nin.
He made us tough.	Waxa uu naga dhigay mid adag.
you were right	sax baad ahayd
Another, and another, and another.	Mid kale, iyo mid kale, iyo mid kale.
I wonder how that would be.	Waxaan la yaabanahay sida ay taasi ahaan lahayd.
It wasn’t much new.	Wax badan ma ahayn wax cusub.
I have to tell you why.	Waa inaan kuu sheego sababta.
Maybe someone had.	Malaha qof baa lahaa.
I hope he got it.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu helay.
And maybe it was.	Oo malaha waxay ahayd.
This is because it is beautiful.	Tani waa sababta oo ah way qurux badan tahay.
This was bad he thought.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xun ayuu u maleeyay.
That she knew.	In ay ogaatay.
She says it's still true.	Waxay tidhi wali waa run.
I think that's amazing.	Waxay ila tahay taasi waa yaab.
You may not be on strike.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan shaqo joojin ku jirin.
A bit too good.	Xoogaa aad u wanaagsan malaha.
That is good for me.	Taasi waa igu fiican tahay aniga.
I can see	waan arki karaa
But he must be happy.	Laakiin waa inuu ku faraxsan yahay.
It's an interesting idea.	Waa fikrad xiiso leh.
He picked it up.	Wuu soo qaaday.
Everyone knows how to get me if they need me.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa sida uu ii heli karo haddii ay ii baahan yihiin.
Anything more is affordable.	Wax kasta oo badan ayaa la awoodi karaa.
There is something about him.	Wax baa ka jira isaga.
He was very similar to you.	Aad buu kula mid ahaa.
I had to get something.	Waxay ahayd inaan wax helo.
They do not agree.	Ma ogolaan.
No one knows you.	Qofna kuma yaqaan.
Recently, in fact.	Dhawaan, dhab ahaantii.
I can't do anything.	Waxba ma qaban karo.
I think this is good.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in tani ay fiican tahay.
Tell them what happened.	U sheeg waxa dhacay.
He has already started.	Hore ayuu u bilaabay.
He got everything.	Wax walba wuu helay.
It is what you want to do.	Waa waxa aad rabto inaad sameyso.
I am still in it	Wali waan ku jiraa
But you can't leave anything there for long.	Laakiin halkaas waxba kama tagi kartid muddo dheer.
That is very bad.	Taasi aad bay u xun tahay.
She probably does.	Waxay u badan tahay inay sameyso.
A lot of the latter.	Wax badan oo tan dambe ah.
Just nothing too big.	Kaliya waxba aad u weyn.
You know.	Waad ogtahay.
In fact, she is very happy.	Runtii, aad bay u faraxsan tahay.
He looks good.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid wanaagsan.
The only person she told.	Qofka kaliya ee ay wax u sheegtay.
It's one after another.	Waa hal ka dib.
He never told anyone.	Waligiis cidna uma uu sheegin.
I decided it would be better.	Waxaan go'aansaday inay fiicnaan lahayd.
I think it was right, after all.	Waxaan filayaa inay sax ahayd, ka dib oo dhan.
It did not take long to do.	Ma qaadan waqti dheer in la sameeyo.
Otherwise, you must.	Haddii kale, waa inaad.
It is very difficult.	Aad bay u adag tahay.
This is real work.	Tani waa shaqo dhab ah.
enough for me.	igu filan aniga.
You just have to do it regularly.	Kaliya waa inaad si joogto ah u sameyso.
That is for everyone.	Taas oo ah qof walba.
And it could be everything else.	Oo waxay noqon kartaa wax kale oo dhan.
Not so big, but solid.	Ma aha sidaas u weyn, laakiin adag.
It looks very interesting.	Waxa uu u muuqdaa mid aad u xiiso badan.
You can stay with him.	Waad la joogi kartaa isaga.
I fear the worst.	Waxaan ka baqayaa kan ugu xun.
I wish I didn't know.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaanan garanayn.
He came back here a while ago.	Wax yar ka hor ayuu halkan ku soo noqday.
If he may be able to do it once.	Haddii laga yaabo inuu awoodo inuu mar sameeyo.
For a while no one spoke.	In muddo ah qofna ma hadlin.
I know everything.	Wax walba waan ogahay.
He always said.	Mar kasta ayuu yidhi.
It certainly is.	Waxa hubaal ah inuu yahay.
It wasn’t, you know.	Ma ahayn, waad ogtahay.
One would believe me.	Mid i rumaysan lahaa.
I didn't want to see it.	Maan rabin inaan arko.
That's right for me.	Waa ii sax.
Postponed again tonight.	Mar kale dib loo dhigay caawa.
But that is to be expected.	Laakiin taasi waa la filayaa.
Only another came in.	Kaliya mid kale oo soo galay.
I wanted to.	waan rabay.
Good one too.	Mid wanaagsan sidoo kale.
He quickly decided what to do.	Waxa uu si degdeg ah u go'aansaday waxa uu sameeyo.
But that is now.	Laakiin taasi waa hadda.
This can be anything you want to do.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto inaad sameyso.
Not too bad here.	Ma ahan mid aad u xun halkan.
Can anyone please help me with this.	Qofna fadlan ma iga caawin karaa arrintan.
As it is.	Sida ay tahay.
tell me what it is.	ii sheeg waxa ay tahay.
There was no way out.	Ma jirin meel laga baxo.
Time cannot be.	Waqti ma noqon karo.
She would always be able to.	Had iyo jeer way awoodi lahayd.
You told me.	Waad ii sheegtay.
No one came.	Qofna ma iman.
And surprisingly beautiful.	Oo qurux badan si yaab leh.
A man of wealth.	Nin wax leh.
What is wrong with him? 	Maxaa isaga u xun?
he said.	ayuu yidhi.
I will be back to him soon.	Dhawaan ayaan u soo noqon doonaa isaga.
He made the door for her.	Albaabka ayuu u sameeyay.
He was everywhere.	Meel walba wuu joogay.
The more you do what you want.	Inta badan oo aad sameyso aad rabto.
I will help.	Waan caawin doonaa.
I heard something similar.	Waxaan maqlay wax la mid ah.
Me and you.	Aniga iyo adiga.
He said you were very busy.	Wuxuu yidhi aad ayaad mashquul u ahayd.
The others were not.	Dadka kale ma ahayn.
I would like to know more.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan wax badan ogaado.
This may not be a good idea.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in tani aysan ahayn fikrad wanaagsan.
I am not doing it to help you.	Uma samaynayo inaan ku caawiyo.
I am the only one	Anigu waxaan ahay kan kaliya
He was a needy man.	Nin baahan buu ahaa.
I had nowhere to go.	Meel aan aado maan haysan.
I'm sorry for him.	waan ka xumahay isaga.
For a while now.	In muddo ah ayaa hadda.
It will be a good time.	Waxay noqon doontaa waqti fiican.
And a smart man.	Iyo nin caqli badan.
You tried so hard.	Aad isku dayay.
I don't want that.	Ma rabto taas.
I do not do it clearly.	Si cad uma sameeyo.
That should be expected.	Taasi waa in la filayaa.
Beautiful and beautiful.	Qurux badan oo qurux badan.
Tom felt he had to say something.	Tom wuxuu dareemay inay tahay inuu wax sheego.
It would not take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan lahayd.
All the better.	Dhammaan ka wanaagsan.
You are probably happy.	Waxaad u badan tahay inaad faraxsan tahay.
I want to know everything.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax walba ogaado.
Everything will be fine, tomorrow.	Wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan, berrito.
Money can still be made.	Lacag weli waa la samayn karaa.
Please correct me if this is bad.	Fadlan i sax haddii ay tani xun tahay.
We can hardly believe we are close to there.	Si dhib ah uma rumaysan karno inaan ku dhow nahay halkaas.
One was the owner.	Mid wuxuu ahaa kii lahaa.
It was as long as he got it.	Waxay ahayd ilaa inta uu helay.
She said it all.	Dhammaan way tidhi.
He obviously did not want to do that.	Waxa cad in aanu doonayn in uu taas sameeyo.
I'm happy to be here.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan halkan joogo.
Not bad, but not great, either.	Ma xun, laakiin ma weyn, sidoo kale.
Always busy	Had iyo jeer ku mashquul
He had this.	Waxa uu lahaa tan.
Sure, they like it.	Hubaal, way jecel yihiin.
He was surprised and surprised.	Wuu yaabay oo la yaabay.
This is not true now.	Tani run maaha hadda.
Today, once upon a time, it was a good day.	Maanta, hal mar, waxay ahayd maalin wanaagsan.
You need to tell them to do this.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad u sheegto inaad taas sameyso.
Not only that.	Kaliya maaha.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay.
It's been a long time.	Waa muddo dheer.
It was a lot of food.	Waxay ahayd cunto aad u badan.
That is exactly what happened.	Runtii taasi waa wixii dhacay.
I don't want to leave him here.	Ma doonayo inaan isaga ka tago halkan.
I wonder what they do.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waxay sameeyaan.
Now this is amazing.	Hadda tani waa yaab.
Well done really.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay runtii.
Maybe he said.	Malaha wuxuu ku yidhi.
You are too much otherwise.	Aad baad u badan tahay haddii kale.
I have never seen it that way.	Weligay sidaas uma arag.
You really are him.	Runtii waxaad tahay isaga.
Today is a turning point.	Maanta waa maalin aan dib loo noqon.
I am very happy to see that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay inaan arko taas.
This is not.	Tani maaha .
I'm sorry, now.	Waan ka xumahay, hadda.
I didn't even like it a bit.	Xitaa xoogaa ima jeclayn.
He came every day.	Maalin walba wuu iman jiray.
He could see nothing.	Waxba wuu arki waayay.
He wondered if he had done so.	Waxa uu is waydiiyay in uu sidaas sameeyay.
Now I can't even afford it.	Hadda xitaa ma awoodo.
I haven't been there in a while.	In muddo ah maan tagin.
I don't know what to do.	Ma garanayo waxa uu sameeyo.
I am everyone else.	Waxaan ahay qof kale oo dhan.
That's something you can't do.	Taasi waa wax aadan sameyn karin.
It was not one.	Mid ma ahayn.
I thought this was very strange.	Waxaan u maleeyay in tani ay aad u yaab badan tahay.
I can't get enough.	Wax igu filan ma heli karo.
It became very difficult to find.	Wuxuu noqday mid aad u adag in la helo.
They still regret that this is the only thing they do.	Weli waxay ka xun yihiin in tani ay tahay waxa kaliya ee ay sameeyaan.
But not bad.	Laakiin si xun maaha.
It looks like nothing.	Waxay la mid tahay in aanay waxba ahayn.
He loves you so much.	Aad buu kuu jecel yahay.
In the same way as it was.	Si la mid ah sidii ay ahayd.
I didn't have time.	Waqti maan helin.
Here, the same is true.	Halkan, isla isla waa run.
Even a few good friends.	Xitaa saaxiibo wanaagsan oo yar.
This should not be difficult.	Tani waa inaysan noqon mid adag.
You told us.	Waad noo sheegtay.
She's fine with me so far.	Way ila fiican tahay ilaa hadda.
Certainly not.	Hubaal ma yeeli doono.
I took the previous one.	Waxaan qaatay mid hore.
Doing it again.	Samaynta mar kale.
Nothing to find here.	Ma jiraan wax laga helo halkan.
He said.	Ayuu yidhi.
Enough to do something else.	Ku filan in wax kale la sameeyo.
I'll be fine here	halkaan ayaan ku fiicnaan doonaa
It was beautiful and long.	Qurux iyo dheer bay ahayd.
I really like this one.	Runtii waan jeclahay kan.
That is new.	Taasi waa mid cusub.
He did not like what he saw.	Ma uu jeclayn waxa uu arkay.
Which it really is.	Taas oo ay runtii tahay.
This just isn't true.	Tani kaliya run maaha.
He pretended nothing.	Waxba wuu iska dhigay.
There is none.	Ma jiro.
But they will love it.	Laakiin way jeclaan doonaan.
There is so much.	Waxaa jira wax aad u badan.
I don't know where to go.	Meel uu aado ma garanayo.
That was really true for me.	Runtii taasi run bay ii ahayd.
this is very bad.	tani aad bay u xun tahay.
They have to do that.	Waa inay sidaas sameeyaan.
But he can't do it alone.	Laakiin keligiis ma samayn karo.
Big trouble now for you.	Dhib weyn hadda adiga.
He returned yesterday.	Shalay ayuu soo noqday.
Much better.	In badan oo ka wanaagsan.
He did not return.	Dib uma soo noqon.
It can be found here.	Waxaa laga heli karaa halkan.
What else is new.	Maxaa kale oo cusub.
Everyone else would be invisible.	Qof kasta oo kale wuxuu ahaan lahaa mid aan la arki karin.
Now, something else.	Hadda, wax kale.
You can't do this.	Ma samayn kartid tan oo kale.
It is often bad.	Inta badan waa xun.
The school to.	Dugsiga in ay.
I did not say how.	Maan u sheegin sida.
One is this.	Mid ka mid ah waa kan.
You can stay with it wherever you are happy.	Waxaad la joogi kartaa meel kasta oo aad ku faraxsan tahay.
In fact, very soon.	Dhab ahaantii, waqti aad u dhow.
You can always take more.	Mar walba wax badan ayaad qaadan kartaa.
I wanted to be tough.	Waxaan rabay inaan noqdo mid adag.
A little more came out.	Wax yar oo kale ayaa soo baxay.
It could be something else.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax kale.
Divorce is hard.	In la kala tago waa adag tahay.
You will be fine.	Waad fiicnaan doontaa.
But there is something.	Laakiin wax baa jira.
It was not right.	Sax ma ahayn.
He could not.	Waa uu awoodi waayay.
This was awful.	Tani waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
He has to go.	Waa inuu tago.
To find out.	Si ay u ogaato.
No one has done that before.	Qofna sidaas ka hor ma samayn.
You can't win.	Ma guulaysan karto.
And not as a friend, either.	Oo maaha sida saaxiib, sidoo kale.
I am at work	Waxa aan ku jiraa shaqo
You did.	Waad samaysay.
You know, until you find out.	Waad ogtahay, ilaa aad wax ka ogaato.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
So far.	Ilaa hadda.
This is correct so far.	Tani waa sax ilaa hadda.
I can't do it now.	Ma samayn karo hadda.
Certainly, it may be small.	Hubaal, waxa laga yaabaa inay yar tahay.
That's what a friend does.	Taasi waa waxa uu saaxiib sameeyo.
I really don't want to do anything other than this.	Runtii ma doonayo inaan sameeyo wax aan tan ahayn.
It was very interesting.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xiiso badan.
Even if it was, you are still fine.	Xitaa haddii ay ahayd, weli waad fiican tahay.
Now it would be great.	Hadda waxay ahaan lahayd mid aad u fiican.
I don't care.	Waxba meesha kuma hayo.
But there was nothing to do but to do.	Laakiin ma jirin wax la sameeyo oo aan ahayn in la sameeyo.
I have to leave	waa inaan baxo
You don't even have to lie.	Xitaa uma baahnid inaad been sheegto.
Obviously, this will not do.	Sida cad, tani ma yeeli doonto.
Whatever he said.	Wax kasta oo uu yidhi.
Both are correct.	Labaduba waa sax.
That’s why you do what you do.	Taasi waa sababta aad u sameyso waxaad sameyso.
But there was nothing beautiful.	Laakiin ma jirin wax qurux badan.
It just won’t do.	Kaliya ma yeeli doono.
Anyway.	Si walba.
There is no constant.	Ma jiro joogto ah.
But it takes time.	Laakiin waxay u baahan tahay waqti.
She said no problems were found.	Waxay sheegtay in aan wax dhibaato ah la helin.
Please let me know if there are any problems	Fadlan ii soo sheeg haddii ay jiraan wax dhibaato ah
Take me with you.	I wada qaado.
That is difficult at first.	Taasi marka hore way adag tahay.
Someone who enjoys work.	Qof ku faraxsan shaqada.
I didn't want him at work.	Maan rabin isaga shaqada.
But let me tell you.	Laakiin aan kuu sheego.
But now, this is not really true.	Laakiin hadda, tani runtii maaha mid sax ah.
I want something more beautiful	Waxaan rabaa wax ka sii qurux badan
They usually do.	Inta badan way sameeyaan.
Maybe he said he did.	Malaha wuxuu yidhi wuu sameeyay.
But it also has beauty.	Laakiin sidoo kale waxay leedahay qurux.
I know what he says.	Waan garanayaa waxa uu sheego.
I can't leave	Ma bixi karo
Doing bad things now.	Samaynta waxyaabo xun hadda.
It didn’t go well together.	Si fiican uma wada bixin.
Now she did not know what was to come.	Hadda ma ay garanayn waxa soo socda.
You should too.	Waa inaad sidoo kale.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
And great, too.	Iyo mid weyn, sidoo kale.
Why.	Maxay tahay sababta.
I am very happy about that.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay taas.
There must be a lot more to this.	Waa inay jiraan wax badan oo tan ah.
Let them do it, they are really good at this.	Ha sameeyaan, runtii way ku fiican yihiin tan.
Everyone had to do the same.	Qof kastaa wuxuu ahaa inuu sameeyo wax la mid ah.
You should not have him.	Waa inaadan haysan isaga.
That is a good thing.	Taas oo ah wax fiican.
You are not alone.	Ma aha keligaa.
I went now.	Hadda ayaan aaday.
It has been a long time, he said.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ayuu is yidhi.
Tomorrow is good for me.	Berri ayaa ii fiican.
he said.	ayuu yiri.
That is a bit of a problem.	Taasi waa xoogaa dhib ah.
That was also for sure.	Taasi sidoo kale waxay ahayd hubaal.
Anything is possible.	Wax walba waa laga yaabaa.
I have to do what you really want.	Waa inaan sameeyaa wax aad runtii rabto.
You can find more here.	Wax badan ayaad ka heli kartaa halkan.
But so far it has not succeeded.	Laakiin ilaa hadda kuma guulaysan.
He did not.	Ma uu samayn.
I did not believe him.	Ma aan rumaysan isaga.
You must.	Waa inaad.
And they didn’t do it just once.	Oo ma ay samayn hal mar kaliya.
You are much better than that.	Aad baad uga fiican tahay taas.
This is a problem.	Tani waa dhib.
He enjoys nothing.	Wax uu ka helo ma jiro.
It was, really, beautiful.	Waxay ahayd, runtii, qurux badan.
He has to go.	Waa inuu tago.
She can't speak now.	Hadda ma hadli karto.
He really knew.	Run ahaantii wuu ogaa.
He got that.	Wuu helay taas.
To do what? 	Si loo sameeyo maxaa?
But it was not.	Laakiin ma ahayn.
Certainly it was one.	Waxa hubaal ah in ay ahayd mid.
Maybe it can help.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawin karto.
In addition to nothing.	Marka laga soo tago wax aan jirin.
No one thought what would happen.	Qofna ma malaynayn waxa dhici doona.
It's a great place to work.	Waa meel fiican oo laga shaqeeyo.
I have to be here for that.	Waa inaan halkaan u joogaa taas.
nin.	nin.
It should have been well known to everyone.	Waxay ahayd in qof walba si fiican u yaqaan.
It was a good idea.	Waxay ahayd fikrad fiican.
The latter is not possible.	Tan dambe malaha.
I knew someone was coming.	Waan ogaa in qof iman doono.
This is not a good idea.	Tani maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
It’s all very good.	Waa wax aad u fiican oo dhan.
Any idea how to do it ?.	Wax fikrad ah sida loo samayn karo?.
I know, he thought.	Waan ogahay, ayuu u maleeyay.
He walked out the door.	Albaabka ayuu ka baxay.
I know she is like me.	Waan ogahay in ay aniga ila mid tahay.
I don't mind that.	Dhib igama qabo taas.
I wanted, more.	Waxaan rabay, wax ka badan.
I think he is in a good place.	Waxaan filayaa inuu meel fiican joogo.
You've done enough here.	Waxaad samaysay kugu filan halkan.
That is not exactly what you want.	Taasi sax maaha waxa aad rabto.
It doesn't look right.	Si sax ah uma eka.
It was a good thing, he told her.	Waxay ahayd wax fiican, ayuu u sheegay.
In fact, it is very difficult to time.	Dhab ahaantii, waxaa aad u adag in ay waqti.
If you can see it, it can see you.	Haddii aad arki karto, way ku arki kartaa.
That is not very beautiful.	Taasi maaha mid aad qurux badan.
It was one after another.	Waxay ahayd hal ka dib.
I think she will do that.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi samayn doonto.
It was also not too bad.	Sidoo kale ma ahayn mid aad u xun.
They are many.	Way badan yihiin.
But it really wasn’t real.	Laakiin dhab ahaantii ma ahayn mid dhab ah.
I'm sure you will find something.	Waxaan hubaa inaad wax ka heli doonto.
I know where you are.	Waan ogahay meesha aad joogto.
Now they do.	Hadda way sameeyaan.
Here and everywhere.	Halkan iyo meel kasta.
Not me.	Aniga ma aha.
It still doesn't work.	Wali ma shaqeeyo.
That was a good thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid wanaagsan.
Also very good.	Sidoo kale aad u fiican.
I will no longer tell you what to do.	Mar dambe noo sheegi maayo waxa la sameeyo.
He looked very happy.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid aad u faraxsan.
Everyone should be happy.	Qof walba waa inuu faraxsan yahay.
You can no longer help him.	Mar dambe ma caawin kartid isaga.
Something bad happened.	Wax xun baa dhacay.
Don't tell me this.	Tan ha i odhan.
You are as good as you are.	Waad ku fiican tahay sida aad tahay.
In fact it may be more than most.	Dhab ahaantii waxa laga yaabaa in ka badan inta badan.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
Spend more time with him.	Waqti badan la qaado isaga.
It was real, and very complicated.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah, oo aad u dhib badan.
Really good even.	Runtii si fiican xitaa.
I need this urgently.	Waxaan u baahanahay tan degdeg ah.
It is not.	Ma aha.
He wants you to know.	Waxa uu rabaa in aad ogaato.
It can't be the other way around.	Ma noqon karto si kale.
He is a very loving man.	Waa nin aad u jecel.
There was not much she could do about it.	Ma jirin wax badan oo ay wax ka qaban karto.
People who don't like me very much.	Dadka aan aad ii jeclayn.
Most of all.	Inta ugu badan oo dhan.
That is untrue.	Taasi waa wax aan run ahayn.
After all, he told her exactly what to do.	Ka dib oo dhan, wuxuu u sheegay si sax ah waxa uu sameeyo.
I didn’t do it right.	Si sax ah uma aanan samayn.
That he said he would do it.	In waxa uu yidhi uu samayn doono.
But he was not alone.	Laakiin keligiis ma ahayn.
I am not able to do this.	Ma awoodo inaan tan sameeyo.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
This can always be done.	Tan mar walba waa la samayn karaa.
She is fine.	Way fiican tahay.
I have another.	Mid kale ayaan hayaa.
But nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale maaha.
It doesn't matter now.	Hadda waxba maaha.
A little faster.	In yar oo degdeg ah.
You may do this.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad tan sameyso.
He is very beautiful	Aad buu u qurux badan yahay
She disappeared, she did.	Waa la waayay, way samaysay.
Mostly, but not always.	Inta badan, laakiin had iyo jeer maaha.
Now it will not be interesting.	Hadda wax xiiso leh ma noqon doonto.
They will do what they will do.	Waxay samayn doonaan waxay samayn doonaan.
That is unknown.	Taasi waa wax aan la garanayn.
She will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayso.
He left.	Wuu ka baxay.
Now he thinks he can do the same.	Hadda wuxuu u malaynayaa inuu sidaas oo kale samayn karo.
I still do it from time to time.	Weli waxaan sameeyaa waqti ka waqti.
Otherwise it’s really not great.	Haddii kale run ahaantii ma ahan mid weyn.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
It is very good for me.	Aad bay ii fiican tahay.
I often don’t get a chance.	Inta badan ma helo fursad.
Any idea that this does to the person.	Fikrad kasta oo ay taasi qofka ku samaynayso.
Which you can do.	Taas oo aad samayn karto.
They will love it.	Way jeclaan doonaan.
That's all really.	Taasi waa dhan runtii.
It will be fine.	Way fiicnaan doontaa.
That was beautiful it was.	Taasi waxay ahayd qurux badan waxay ahayd.
There is no problem.	Wax dhib ah ma jiraan.
They do good things.	Wax wanaagsan bay sameeyaan.
I wonder who it is.	Waxaan la yaabanahay waa kuma.
He told you something.	Wax buu kaa sheegay.
He does but is.	Wuu sameeyaa laakiin waa.
It can't even happen.	Xitaa ma dhici karto.
He is in that.	Isaga ayaa taas ku jira.
Good idea, but not really.	Fikrad fiican, laakiin dhab ahaantii maaha.
He could do no less.	Wax ka yar ma uu qaban karin.
How? 	Sidee?
he said.	ayuu yiri.
It is clearly there.	Waxaa si cad halkaas.
You said someone else was in the room.	Waxaad sheegtay in qof kale ku jiro qolka.
I have a place there, but not much.	Meel baan halkaas ku leeyahay, laakiin aad uma badna.
I don't know that.	Ma garanayo taas.
I'll talk about that later.	Dib ayaan uga hadli doonaa.
It is not ongoing.	Ma ahan mid socda.
It really isn't.	Runtii uma eka.
She told us what to do.	Waxa ay noo sheegtay waxa la sameeyo.
I'm sure we are the same.	Waxaan hubaa inaan isku si nahay.
I can't afford one.	Ma awoodo mid.
It was a long and difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin dheer oo adag.
Maybe he did.	Malaha wuu sameeyay.
I will not go home.	Guriga ma aadi doono.
And he was so beautiful there.	Oo wuxuu ahaa mid aad u qurux badan halkaas.
I will tell you something else.	Wax kale ayaan kuu sheegi doonaa.
He will come home.	Wuu iman doona guriga.
It is unbelievable.	Waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
I'm happy.	Waan ku faraxsanahay.
But that cannot be helped.	Laakiin taasi lama caawin karo.
He looked bad.	Wuxuu u muuqday mid xun.
That is what she needs.	Taasi waa waxa ay u baahan tahay.
Not like before.	Ma aha sidii hore oo kale.
I really don't know for sure.	Run ahaantii ma garanayo hubaal.
She had to do it.	Waxay ahayd inuu sameeyo.
She would go.	Way tagi lahayd.
That is enough for one day.	Taasi waa ku filan hal maalin.
Not much.	Wax badan malaha.
Now he was very fast.	Hadda waxa uu ahaa mid aad u degdeg badan.
He wanted to do this right.	Wuxuu rabay inuu tan si sax ah u sameeyo.
You did more than enough for one day.	Waxaad samaysay wax ka badan oo kugu filan hal maalin.
But here, no one was there.	Laakiin halkan, qofna ma jirin.
But it will take time.	Laakiin waxay qaadan doontaa waqti.
It's a car.	Waa baabuur.
There is so much more she can do.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo kale oo ay sameyn karto.
Do the work.	Qabo shaqada.
You look happy.	Waxaad u egtahay mid faraxsan.
I think it will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inuu fiicnaan doono.
Wherever he is, he is alive.	Meel uu joogo, wuu nool yahay.
You were little.	Waxaad ahayd wax yar.
It really is a good idea.	Runtii waa fikrad fiican.
This is new	Tani waa cusub
It had nothing to do with it.	Wax shaqo ah kuma lahayn.
In fact, you did not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aadan samayn.
A little, a little bit.	Wax yar, xoogaa xoogaa.
A lot is out.	In badan baa baxay.
As if it were not true.	Sida aanay run ahayn.
It will not be done.	Laga yeeli maayo.
He took everything.	Wax walba wuu qaatay.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Qof kastaa ma samayn karo waxaad samayso.
He knew.	Wuu ogaa.
I will be good at this.	Waan ku fiicnaan doonaa kan.
Not so here.	Halkan sidaas maaha.
You know, enough time is going on.	Waad ogtahay, waqti ku filan ayaa socda.
Free.	Lacag la'aan .
Now here was another opportunity.	Hadda halkan waxay ahayd fursad kale.
It should not be too much work.	Waa inaysan noqon shaqo badan.
He did not do it again.	Mar dambe ma uu samayn.
You can leave here tomorrow.	Waxaad ka bixi kartaa halkan berrito.
I'll tell a friend.	Waxaan u sheegi doonaa saaxiib.
Everyone came to see.	Qof walba ayaa u yimid inuu arko.
That would not take long.	Taasi ma qaadan lahayn waqti dheer.
But he did not take any food.	Laakiin ma uu qaadan wax cunto ah.
It's too much.	Aad bay u badan tahay.
I think you would really like him.	Waxaan filayaa inaad runtii isaga jeclaan lahayd.
You can tell what you want to the person you want.	Waxaad u sheegi kartaa waxaad rabto qofka aad rabto.
You have to do a lot.	Waa in aad sameyso wax badan.
He really didn't know.	Runtii ma uu ogayn.
I can only get to work on one.	Waxaan ku heli karaa oo kaliya inaan ku shaqeeyo hal.
Not given.	Lama siin.
Don't take anything for granted.	Waxba ha u qaadan.
I know all of you.	Waan ogahay dhammaan adiga.
.	.
But it is a lot of work.	Laakiin waa shaqo badan.
If you don't need it, don't do it.	Haddii aadan u baahnayn, ha samayn.
He had no idea what someone could get.	Wax fikrad ah ma uu lahayn waxa uu qof ku heli karo.
He knows where you are.	Meesha aad joogto wuu garanayaa.
I didn't have time.	Waqti ma helin.
It's great to be with you.	Aad bay u fiican tahay inaan kula joogo.
Everyone knew who that would be.	Qof kastaa wuu ogaa cidda taasi noqon lahayd.
No one could say who they were.	Qofna ma sheegi karin cidda ay yihiin.
He knew she was coming.	Wuu ogaa inay iman doonto.
No one wants anything.	Qofna waxba kama rabo.
In fact, no one.	Dhab ahaantii, qofna ma jiro.
It was very small.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u yar.
I'm sure.	Waan hubaa.
A lot has happened quickly.	Wax badan ayaa u dhacay si degdeg ah.
I know how much that can hurt	Waan ogahay inta ay taasi wax yeeli karto
This just isn't true.	Tani kaliya run maaha.
Even one day.	Xitaa hal maalin.
I will do it again	Mar kale ayaan sameyn doonaa
He is a good friend.	Waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
She did.	Way samaysay.
It's too bad he's not here.	Aad bay u xun tahay inuusan halkan joogin.
Every man is like that.	Nin walba waa sidaas.
How good.	Sidee u fiican .
There is little.	Wax yar ma jiro.
Here is the new one.	Waa kan mid cusub.
He will love you.	Wuu ku jeclaan doonaa.
Maybe after a while.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in xoogaa ka dib.
It was very, very difficult but.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u adag, aad u adag laakiin.
This is not a good idea.	Tani maaha fikrad wanaagsan.
You can still do it if you do it well.	Weli waad samayn kartaa haddii aad si fiican u sameyso.
Still, you can't say enough.	Weli, kugu filan ma odhan kartid.
It just won’t end.	Kaliya ma dhammaan doonto.
What happened to you is horrible.	Waxa kugu dhacay waa wax aad u xun.
I am who she is.	aniga ayaa ah kan ay tahay.
That is clearly not the case.	Taasi si cad maaha.
Here, you can find this.	Halkan, waxaad heli kartaa kan.
I hope to see you there soon.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaan ku arko halkaas dhawaan.
I can't do it	Ma samayn karo
The best is not always the case.	Sida ugu fiican mar kasta maaha.
I had a very bad day.	Waxaan lahaa maalin aad u xun.
That will all come in good time.	Taasi waxay dhammaan iman doontaa waqti fiican.
It is not unprecedented.	Maaha wax aan hore loo arag.
But he is not a friend.	Laakiin maaha saaxiib.
I did.	Aniga ayaa sameeyay.
I was also there for him all the time.	Waxaan sidoo kale u joogi jiray isaga mar kasta.
It was constant.	Waxay ahayd mid joogto ah.
It will take some time.	Waxay qaadan doontaa muddo.
I love being here	Waxaan jeclahay inaad halkaan joogto
I hope so.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay sidaas tahay.
Maybe a little.	Malaha waa wax yar.
Often there was not enough money.	Inta badan ma jirin lacag ku filan.
You are something.	Wax baad tahay .
I thought you would win.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad guulaysan doonto.
He is nobody.	Cidna uma aha.
Something else happened.	Wax kale ayaa dhacay.
I thought it was amazing.	Waxaan u maleeyay in ay tahay yaab.
It will be the same.	Waxay ahaan doontaa isku mid.
I will get a new job	Waxaan heli doonaa shaqo cusub
I'm sure .	Waan hubaa .
There is no time to find it.	Ma jiro wakhti lagu helo.
That will still be seen.	Taasi wali waa la arki doonaa.
She knew now that he would like it.	Way ogaatay hadda inuu jeclaan lahaa.
So far, very beautiful.	Ilaa hadda, aad u qurux badan.
It is better to leave.	Waxaa u wanaagsan inuu ka tago.
She did not like him.	Ma ay jeclayn isaga.
Take whatever you want.	Qaado wax kasta oo aad rabto.
When he returned he found this.	Markii uu soo noqday ayuu tan helay.
There are no other cars in the area.	Meesha ma jiraan baabuur kale.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
He seemed to do nothing.	Waxa uu u muuqday in aanu waxba samayn.
Here I am not even sure of that.	Halkan xitaa ma hubo taas.
He will be a good man.	Wuxuu noqon doonaa nin wanaagsan.
It's the worst.	Waa tan ugu xun.
What a great idea.	Waa maxay fikrad fiican.
This is where they will go.	Waa kan meesha ay tagi doonaan.
I hope he doesn't.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuusan yeeli doonin.
I thought we could be friends.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaan noqon karno saaxiibo.
It is very good now.	Aad bay u fiican tahay hadda.
Back a little bit	Dib u yara yara
It is very small and beautiful.	Aad bay u yar tahay oo qurux badan tahay.
You have to stay.	Waa inaad joogto.
That is what you want me to say.	Taasi waa waxa aad rabto in aan sheego.
That was it too.	Taasi waxay ahayd sidoo kale.
Got something else.	Wax kale helay.
I have no idea it was there.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo inay halkaas ahayd.
I had a good time.	Waqti fiican ayaan qaatay.
That's right.	Waa sidaas.
I knew you would be.	Waan ogaa inaad noqon doonto.
I am very happy about this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
That's not like him.	Taasi ma aha isaga oo kale.
I really don't want that.	Dhab ahaantii ma rabo taas.
I always wonder who did it.	Had iyo jeer waxaan la yaabanahay cidda samaysay.
This is a real problem for me.	Tani waa dhibaato dhab ah aniga.
Take it now.	Hadda qaado.
I entered.	waan galay.
Mostly it is what we do.	Inta badan waa waxa aan samayno.
If you want it, it will be.	Haddii aad rabto, way ahaan doontaa.
And something else.	Iyo wax kale.
At first it was very difficult.	Markii hore waxay ahayd mid aad u adag.
He is not coming back! 	Ma soo noqon!
.	.
They are a good idea.	Waxay yihiin fikrad wanaagsan.
I just spent a lot of time.	Kaliya waqti badan ayaan qaatay.
I really know how it is.	Dhab ahaan waan garanayaa sida ay taasi tahay.
He may break up again.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu mar kale kala tago.
Good day, you.	Maalin wanaagsan, adiga.
They need a man.	Nin bay u baahan yihiin.
But we do not do that.	Laakiin taas ma samayno.
I think he really loves you.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu dhab ahaantii ku jecel yahay adiga.
You can be.	Waxaad noqon kartaa.
I think so.	Waxaan u malaynayaa.
I think it’s a real problem, really big.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay tahay dhibaato dhab ah, runtii weyn.
He knew it was true.	Wuu ogaa inay run tahay.
.	.
She did not want to know him.	Ma ay jeclayn inay ogaato isaga.
He took it seriously.	Si dhab ah ayuu u qaatay.
I know what we can do.	Waan ogahay waxaan samayn karno.
I really had.	Runtii waan lahaa.
It's him, but more so.	Waa isaga, laakiin si ka sii badan.
This is not surprising.	Tani lama yaabay.
You were the one who picked it up.	Adiga ayaa ahaa kii soo qaaday.
I would stay here	halkaan ayaan joogi lahaa
You might even like it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad xitaa jeceshahay.
I don’t know how he does it, really.	Ma garanayo sida uu u sameeyo, runtii.
I am very scared	Aad ayaan uga baqayaa
It looks bad.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa mid xun.
You need to be small.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad yar tahay.
That is because it is not.	Taasi waa sababta oo ah maaha.
She did what she did.	Waxay samaysay waxay samaysay.
Very good friend.	Saaxiib aad u wanaagsan.
I have never done anything like this.	Weligay ma samayn wax la mid ah.
Not a bad job, either.	Ma aha shaqo xun, sidoo kale.
All me and me.	Dhammaan aniga iyo aniga.
I am not	Ma ihi
She had nothing to do.	Wax ay samayso way wayday.
Just tell me that.	Kaliya taas ii sheeg.
You will be leaving soon.	Dhawaan ayaad bixi doontaa.
He saw little.	Wax yar ayuu arkay.
That is exactly what you need.	Runtii taasi waa waxa aad u baahan tahay.
There is only so much beauty to see.	Waxaa jira kaliya qurux badan oo la arko.
Nothing denied you.	Waxba kaa diiday.
Take it upon yourself to do this for sure.	Qaado inaad tan sameyso si hubaal ah.
That is similar to what we do with everything.	Taasi waxay la mid tahay waxa aan ku samayno wax kasta.
you think.	waxaad u malaynaysaa.
This is a problem for me.	Tani waa igu dhib.
It is also a problem.	Sidoo kale waa dhibaato.
I didn't want anything else.	Wax kale ma rabin.
I did not know why.	Maan garanayn sababta.
It was real, true.	Waxay ahayd mid dhab ah, run ah.
Ah! 	Ah!
He really wanted to leave.	Runtii wuxuu rabay inuu baxo.
Both are definitely interesting.	Labaduba waa hubaal xiiso badan.
I have something for you	wax baan kuu hayaa
Maybe one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in maalin.
He returned in a short time.	Waqti yar ayuu ku soo noqday.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
Certainly not you.	Hubaal adiga maaha.
It was a beautiful day.	Waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
Everything is too long ahead.	Wax walba waa aad u dheer ka hor.
He is really good.	Runtii wuu fiican yahay.
He lives with us.	Wuu nala nool yahay.
The cause is still unknown.	Sababta ilaa hadda lama garanayo.
It would be a great promise of time.	Waxay noqon lahayd ballan weyn oo waqti ah.
This will take a lot to do.	Tani waxay qaadan doontaa wax badan oo la sameeyo.
He can be anywhere.	Meel kasta wuu joogi karaa.
He always had time.	Mar walba wakhti buu lahaa.
You belong here to me.	Adiga ayaa iska leh halkan aniga.
That’s how we really are.	Taasi waa sida aan dhab ahaan nahay.
That includes you.	Taas waxaa ku jira adiga.
I felt for him.	Waxaan dareemay isaga.
I can't talk anymore.	Ma hadli karo mar dambe.
They are so good before school.	Dugsiga ka hor aad bay u fiican yihiin sidaas.
Not then what he now knew.	Ma ka dib waxa uu hadda ogaa.
She didn't want to know who she was.	Ma ay rabin inay ogaato cidda ay tahay.
Maybe too much.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad u badan.
It was a long time apparently.	Waxay ahayd wakhti dheer sida cad.
.	.
He knew a lot about it.	Wax badan ayuu ka ogaa.
He said he could help.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu caawin karo.
It can happen to anyone.	Waxay ku dhici kartaa qof kasta.
I can be	waan noqon karaa
You can leave	Waad bixi kartaa
No one can say.	Qofna ma sheegi karo.
It can't hurt you anymore.	Wax dambe kuma yeeli karo.
He knew it was.	Wuu ogaa inay ahayd.
I tried to talk to him.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan la hadlo.
Nothing long.	Wax dheer ma jiraan.
In addition, it is very fun to eat.	Waxaa dheer, waa wax aad u xiiso badan in la cuno.
You can see it in other people's work.	Waxaad ku arki kartaa shaqada dadka kale.
You are good to everyone and you are smart.	Qof walba waad u fiican tahay oo caqli baad tahay.
She always knows.	Had iyo jeer way ogtahay.
She knew he was there.	Way ogaatay inuu meesha joogo.
She had him.	Way lahayd isaga.
But that is old.	Laakiin taasi waa hore.
I do not love you.	Kuma jecli.
Maybe he is here with us.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu halkan nala joogo.
I don't think that's right.	Uma maleynayo in taasi sax tahay.
No one loves me	Qofna ima jecla
That is a bad idea.	Taasi waa fikrad xun.
This looks good.	Tani waxay u egtahay mid wanaagsan.
Tell them we can help.	U sheeg inaan caawin karno.
She can take as long as she likes.	Waxay qaadan kartaa ilaa inta ay jeceshahay.
That is why.	Taasi waa sababta.
Nothing to talk about, unless it is necessary.	Ma jiro wax laga hadlo, haddii aan loo baahnayn.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
It was really amazing.	Runtii waxay ahayd yaab.
How can he say this.	Sidee buu tan u sheegi karaa .
Where he is now.	Halka uu hadda joogo.
Maybe it's you.	Malaha waa adiga.
We do not do that here.	Taas kuma samayno halkan.
Before you leave.	Inta aadan bixin.
I am happy with that.	Waan ku faraxsanahay taas.
They love this.	Way jecel yihiin tan.
Just a friend at home.	Kaliya saaxiib guriga.
I don't know if that's true.	Ma garanayo inay taasi sax tahay.
I don't have a job.	Ma haysto shaqo.
You will love it there	Waad ku jeclaan doontaa halkaas
And not just someone would do it, either.	Oo ma aha oo kaliya qof samayn lahaa, sidoo kale.
No one wants it.	Cidna ma rabo.
I do not know.	Ma garanayo.
You, he said.	Adiga, ayuu yidhi.
Let them know you are ready.	U sheeg inaad diyaar u tahay.
There is no urgency please.	Ma jiro wax degdeg ah fadlan.
You are better than this.	Waad ka fiican tahay kan.
I can't say enough !.	Wax ku filan ma odhan karo!.
Now you need to do something really.	Hadda waxaad u baahan tahay inaad tan dhab ahaantii wax ku samayso.
It's really hard.	Runtii waa adag tahay.
I lost him.	waan waayay isaga.
I guess that doesn’t tell you anything new.	Waxaan u maleynayaa in taasi aysan kuu sheegin wax cusub.
I think that is it.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay.
That was unknown.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax aan la garanayn.
Mary is tough.	Maryan waa adag tahay.
The school's.	Dugsiga ee.
I felt so bad.	Waxaan dareemay wax aad u xun.
There is more to be said.	Wax badan oo kale ayaa jira in la sheego.
Another great meal.	Cunto kale oo weyn.
That is not a good idea.	Taasi fikrad fiican maaha.
Something happened to him.	Wax baa ku dhacay.
That is a good idea.	Taasi waa fikrad fiican.
La! 	La!
la! 	la!
Surprising, but true.	Yaab, laakiin run.
Just me.	Aniga kaliya.
I hear.	Waan maqlay.
An unknown man.	Nin aan la garanayn.
Stop that.	Jooji taas.
I haven’t felt well in a long time.	Anigu ma dareemayo fiicnaan muddo aad u dheer.
It will happen.	Wuu dhici doonaa.
You still need work	Weli waxaad u baahan tahay shaqo
Very interesting.	Aad u xiiso badan.
I would not do this.	Anigu ma samayn lahaa tan.
I'm surprised he doesn't know how to speak.	Waxaan la yaabanahay ma yaqaan sida loo hadlo.
It will be something very new.	Waxay noqon doontaa wax aad u cusub.
You can do this however you want.	Waad samayn kartaa taas si kasta oo aad rabto.
He is alone.	Keligiis ayuu joogaa.
She really did.	Dhab ahaantii way samaysay.
I found something for you.	Wax baan kuu helay.
Now, that’s amazing.	Hadda, taasi waa yaab.
Everyone knows this is what we need.	Qof walba waa ogyahay in tani ay tahay waxa aan u baahanahay.
She was ready to do anything.	Waxay diyaar u ahayd inay sameyso wax kasta.
I can talk about everything.	Wax walba waan kala hadli karaa.
I just don’t.	Kaliya ma sameeyo.
Also, very well done.	Sidoo kale, si aad u wanaagsan loo sameeyay.
As you might expect, maybe.	Sida aad filan lahayd, malaha.
I will not tell another.	Mid kale u sheegi maayo.
I could not find a job	Maan heli karin shaqo
I love you too	sidoo kale waan ku jeclahay
It has always been so.	Mar walba sidaas buu ahaa.
I thought someone would see us.	Waxaan mooday in qof na arki doono.
I know he got it.	Waan ogahay inuu helay.
This will be difficult.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid adag.
I wanted to stay here.	Waxaan rabay inaan halkaan sii joogo.
It is still true.	Wali waa dhab.
It is really very popular.	Runtii waa mid aad loo jecel yahay.
I just didn’t understand.	Kaliya ma fahmin.
Maybe it will be one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu maalin ahaan doono.
The whole room is made up.	Qolka oo dhan waa la sameeyay.
It was a new day.	Waxay ahayd maalin cusub.
I had to buy it.	Waxay ahayd inaan iibsado.
He took it well.	Si fiican buu u qaatay.
I am afraid.	waxaan ka baqayaa .
I will get a job.	Waxaan heli doonaa shaqo.
You really like it.	Runtii waad jeceshahay.
It's amazing how.	Waa yaab sida.
I have a job for you	shaqo baan kuu hayaa
You didn’t do something you didn’t want to do.	Ma aadan samayn wax aadan rabin inaad samayso.
I had a good time.	Waxaan helay waqti fiican.
He could not do it alone.	Keligiis ayuu wax ka qaban waayay.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii waan ka xumahay.
You need luck.	Waxaad u baahan tahay nasiib.
I really want him.	Aad ayaan u rabaa isaga.
That can happen.	Taasi way dhici kartaa.
That can help a lot.	Taasi waxay ku caawin kartaa wax badan.
I was really there.	Runtii halkaas ayaan u joogay.
I know it all.	Waan ogahay dhammaan.
He is not one of us.	Ma aha mid naga mid ah.
But now not too much.	Laakiin hadda aad uma badna.
He must be a great man, really.	Waa inuu yahay nin weyn, runtii.
I know.	Waan ogahay.
I did not say.	Ma odhan.
Somehow, it was true.	Si ahaan, run bay ahayd.
It has always been.	Had iyo jeer waa jiray.
But not much.	Laakiin wax badan maaha.
Certainly there are.	Waxaa hubaal ah inay jiraan.
I saw some amazing things.	Waxyaabo yaab leh ayaan ku arkay.
He said he feels less than all.	Waxa uu sheegay in uu dareemayo wax ka yar oo dhan.
Please let me know when it is available	Fadlan ii soo sheeg marka la heli karo
There is no way to do it.	Ma jirto si ay u sameeyaan.
I wanted to see why.	Waxaan rabay inaan arko sababta.
You really don't need much more.	Runtii waa inaadan u baahnayn wax kale oo badan.
So all.	Sidaas oo dhan .
I always want to be a person.	Mar walba waxaan rabaa inaan noqdo qof.
There is no charge	Wax lacag ah kuma jiraan
I had no money.	Lacag ma haysan.
This is not surprising.	Tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
Something new and new	Wax cusub oo cusub
This is a thing.	Tani waa wax.
One car went in, one car went out.	Hal baabuur ayaa galay, hal baabuur ayaa baxay.
I don't even want to talk about it.	Xitaa ma rabo inaan ka hadlo.
Not now.	Hadda maaha.
It's a good idea.	Waa fikrad fiican.
And much better.	Iyo inta ka sii wanaagsan.
He can get it first.	Marka hore waa uu heli karaa.
But that is not true.	Laakiin taasi sax maaha.
But it will be for you a long time.	Laakiin waxay kuu noqon doontaa wakhti dheer.
I am in that.	Aniga ayaa ku jira taas.
That was a good thing to see.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax wanaagsan in la arko.
Now he was real.	Hadda wuu dhab ahaa.
It wouldn't take much.	Wax badan ma qaadan lahayn.
It's too big.	Waa mid aad u weyn.
Like nothing.	Sida waxba ma jiraan.
Can you help the same.	Ma ku caawin kartaa isla sidaas.
But it is still good.	Laakiin weli waa mid wanaagsan.
You will see that it is true.	Waxaad arki doontaa inay run tahay.
It is enough to know that it exists.	Waa ku filan tahay in la ogaado in ay jirto.
I would love to, really.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa, run ahaantii.
She will find you.	Way ku heli doontaa.
It can only keep you.	Waxay ku haysan kartaa oo kaliya.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	Oo wax xun ma jiraan.
that he could not see.	in uusan arki karin.
It can be surprising there.	Waxay noqon kartaa wax la yaab leh halkaas.
I know they are only three.	Waan ogahay inay yihiin saddex kaliya.
I have to do it	Waa inaan sameeyaa
I am a lucky man.	waxaan ahay nin nasiib badan.
He did not pay.	Lacag kuma bixin.
In fact, there is nothing worse.	Run ahaantii, ma jiraan wax ka sii xun.
He went to jail and spent time there.	Waxa uu galay xabsiga oo uu ku qaatay waqti.
You know they do.	Waad ogtahay inay sameeyaan.
Which is great to have.	Taas oo ku fiican in la haysto.
Not this closely.	Ma aha tan si dhow.
Also, what you do.	Sidoo kale, waxa aad sameyso.
She is very good at it.	Aad bay ugu fiican tahay.
Not sure why.	Ma hubo sababta.
He said beautifully what he wanted to do.	Wuxuu si qurux badan u sheegay wuxuu rabo inuu sameeyo.
What a great thing.	Waa maxay wax weyn.
I know it was for me.	Waan ogahay inay aniga ii ahayd.
I can't talk to anyone else.	Uma hadli karo qof kasta oo kale.
Certainly not for several years.	Dhab ahaantii ma aha dhowr sano.
Perfect for what I need.	Ku fiican waxa aan u baahanahay.
You are really bad.	Aad baad u xun runtii.
Not found.	Lama helin.
It takes time.	Waqti ayuu u baahan yahay .
They are long.	Waxay muddo dheer yihiin.
We can no longer take it.	Mar dambe ma qaadan karno.
But that didn't work out.	Laakiin taasi waxba kama soo bixin.
But you weren’t.	Laakiin ma aadan ahayn.
No wonder indeed.	La yaab maaha runtii.
He was at work, he said.	Waxa uu ku jiray shaqada, ayuu yidhi.
He may be present	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu joogo
That has something to do with me.	Taasi wax bay i leedahay.
That being said.	Taas oo la yidhi.
I just wonder how good you really are.	Kaliya waxaan la yaabanahay sida aad u fiican tahay runtii.
This was a great day.	Tani waxay ahayd maalin weyn.
I found a long car at home.	Waxaan helay baabuur dheer guriga.
he said to himself.	ayuu is yidhi.
After that, you can get another one.	Taas ka dib, waxaad heli kartaa mid kale.
I tried to find it, but, unlucky.	Waxaan isku dayay inaan helo, laakiin, nasiib ma leh.
There are things to do.	Waxaa jira waxyaabo la sameeyo.
He must have heard it somewhere.	Waa in uu meel ka maqlay.
That cannot be allowed.	Taas lama ogolaan karo.
But that is all before.	Laakiin taasi waa hore oo dhan.
It has always been correctly placed here.	Had iyo jeer si sax ah ayaa loo dhigay halkan.
I can be anywhere	meel kasta waan joogi karaa
I can't see anything bad.	Wax xun ma arki karo.
And no one talked to him.	Oo aan cidna kala hadlin.
You have done something wrong.	Wax xun baad samaysay.
But others will say it's bad.	Laakiin dadka kale waxay odhan doonaan waa wax xun.
I asked for more.	Waxyaabo kale ayaan waydiiyay.
Really, really bad.	Runtii, runtii mid xun.
But it is hard work.	Laakiin waa shaqo adag.
Much can be done.	Wax badan ayaa la qaban karaa.
October was right there.	Oktoobar waxay ahayd isla halkaas.
I will say that.	taas ayaan odhan doonaa.
I think so.	Waxaan qabaa taas.
Unemployed, unlucky here.	Shaqo la'aan, halkan nasiib ma leh.
Conflict or not.	Isku dhacay iyo in kale.
And tonight.	Iyo caawa .
I hope that is not true.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaysan taasi run ahayn.
You just can't do it.	Kaliya ma sameyn kartid.
This is done at any time.	Tan waxaa la sameeyaa wakhti kasta.
I had no idea.	Wax fikrad ah maan ka haysan.
But she had to stay there.	Laakiin waxay ahayd inay halkaas joogto.
I am for sure, otherwise.	Aniga waa hubaal, haddii kale.
He never did anything.	Waligiis waxba ma uu samayn.
This may be my favorite.	Tani waxaa laga yaabaa in aan jeclahay.
And really, it still is.	Oo runtii, weli waa.
Uma eka.	Uma eka.
More cars will come.	Baabuur badan ayaa iman doona.
Nice to tell you.	Ku faraxsanahay inaan kuu sheego.
Good friends.	Saaxiibo fiican .
It is still so.	Wali waa sidaas.
I am really happy about this.	Runtii aad baan ugu faraxsanahay tan.
She didn't know what to do.	Wax ay samayso ma ay garanayn.
And beautiful.	Oo qurux badan .
This is great, man.	Tani waa weyn, nin.
But he could not when he could not even see.	Laakiin wuu awoodi waayay markii uu xitaa arki waayay.
I hope everyone is fine.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in qof walba uu fiican yahay.
I can't speak right now.	Ma hadli karo hadda.
You can do more	Wax badan ayaad samayn kartaa
And nothing.	Iyo waxba.
It's so beautiful, he thought.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay, ayuu is yidhi.
He was surprised to see it there.	Wuxuu la yaabay inuu halkaas ku arko.
I can't take it.	Ma qaadan karo aniga.
I really enjoyed it.	Runtii waan ka helay.
Maybe something else, too.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in wax kale, sidoo kale.
It was really true.	Runtii run bay ahayd.
He was unpopular.	Wuxuu ahaa mid aan la jeclayn.
I'm sure it won't	Waan hubaa ma yeeli doono
Someone who knows.	Qof yaqaan.
Something similar.	Wax la mid ah.
Maybe he thought he could help me.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuu u maleeyay inuu i caawin karo.
Not like me.	Aniga oo kale maaha.
That is a fact.	Waa dhab taas.
I am very, very happy.	Aad iyo aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
I do not understand you.	kuma fahmin.
For a while, he said nothing.	In muddo ah, waxba ma uu odhan.
This is what you need to know.	Tani waa waxa aad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
You can still have that.	Weli waad haysan kartaa taas.
He did this several times.	Dhowr jeer ayuu taas sameeyay.
That's what.	Taasi waa waxa.
Maybe it's the same as it used to be.	Waxa laga yaabaa inuu yahay sidii uu mar ahaan jiray.
I will not find it otherwise.	Si kale uma heli doono.
I can tell you everything.	Wax walba waan kuu sheegi karaa.
That would be a lie.	Taasi waxay noqon lahayd been.
I don't know why he thought so.	Ma garanayo sababta uu sidaas ugu maleeyay.
Here today, gone tomorrow.	Halkan maanta, berri tagay.
Something very bad came up here.	Wax aad u xun ayaa halkan yimid.
They are unlikely to be more.	Uma badna in ay ka badan yihiin.
I'm scared.	Waxaan ka baqayaa .
He knows it's not true.	Wuu ogyahay in aanay run ahayn.
Don't have time now.	Ha haysan wakhti hadda.
He had nowhere to go.	Ma jirin meel uu aado.
Which is not true.	Taas oo aan run ahayn.
I was very busy	mashquul badan baan ahaa
It will be good you know.	Way fiicnaan doontaa waad ogtahay.
This is hard work.	Tani waa shaqo adag.
Maybe it is.	Malaha waa .
It’s not a real job.	Ma aha shaqo dhab ah.
Not done once.	Lama samayn hal mar.
In fact that is often true.	Run ahaantii taasi inta badan waa run.
I have so many friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo aad u badan.
There is nothing really new.	Wax cusub oo dhab ah ma jiro.
I have a genius.	Waxaan leeyahay caqli yaqaan.
Everyone does that.	Qof kastaa sidaas ayuu sameeyaa.
It was someone else.	Waxay ahayd qof kale.
That is why he came home early.	Taasi waa sababta uu goor hore u yimid guriga.
He would not do it.	Ma uu yeeli lahaa.
They are good.	Way fiican yihiin.
he was a very tough guy.	nin aad u adag buu ahaa .
It was a familiar problem.	Waxay ahayd dhibaato la yaqaan.
I refused.	waan diiday.
I know very little about him, though.	Wax yar ayaan ka garanayaa isaga, in kasta oo wax walba.
She had no problem staying with another man.	Wax dhib ah ma lahayn inay nin kale la joogto.
She just wants to know what everyone wants.	Waxay jeceshahay oo kaliya inay ogaato waxa qof kastaa doonayo.
I think I want this.	Waxa la ii malaynayaa in aan tan rabo.
But only once.	Laakiin kaliya hal mar.
But that is also enough.	Laakiin taasi sidoo kale waa ku filan tahay.
Work already done.	Shaqada hore loo sameeyay.
I have nothing to say.	Ma hayo wax aan sheego.
Don't tell anyone.	Cidna ha ii sheegin.
tell me him.	ii sheeg isaga.
He said again.	Mar kale buu yidhi.
You look so big.	Waxaad u egtahay mid aad u weyn.
.	.
Not like you.	Adiga oo kale maaha.
I want it back	dib ayaan rabaa
It is much better at home.	Aad ayuu uga fiican yahay guriga.
I am really happy.	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay.
They are long, too.	Way dheer yihiin, sidoo kale.
That is a good thing.	Taasi waa wax fiican.
I have no idea what to do with that.	Ma hayo wax fikrad ah oo aan ku sameeyo taas.
There is no way to tell.	Ma jirto si loo sheego.
And you did a very good job.	Oo waxaad samaysay shaqo aad u wanaagsan.
Nothing bad will happen, maybe.	Wax aad u xun ma dhici doono, malaha.
I was not given.	La ima siin.
But again, he would leave.	Laakiin mar kale, wuu ka bixi lahaa.
There was no such thing.	Wax la mid ah ma jirin.
Not too much, too.	Aad uma badna, sidoo kale.
Not so.	Sidaas maaha.
Only to be rejected.	Kaliya in la diiday.
She would say it has to work.	Waxay odhan lahayd waa inuu u shaqeeyo.
This is probably true.	Tani waxay u badan tahay run.
He is definitely alive.	Waa hubaal inuu nool yahay.
It is a difficult time for him.	Waa wakhti adag isaga.
They would not be here.	Ma ay joogi lahayn halkan.
But only after.	Laakiin kaliya ka dib.
Don't do this today.	Maanta tan ha samayn.
He did not talk about it.	Ma uusan ka hadlin.
This was a problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhibaato.
That is what I will do.	Taasi waa waxa aan sameyn doono.
I think this is something new.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay tahay wax cusub.
He felt it was the least he could do.	Waxa uu dareemay in ay tahay waxa ugu yar ee uu samayn karo.
That's what everyone had.	Sidaas ayaa qof walba lahaa.
But she refused to do it.	Laakiin way diiday inay samayso.
It's the same for everyone else here.	Waa la mid qof kasta oo kale halkan.
I found something real here.	Wax dhab ah ayaa halkan ka helay.
That's what you said.	Waa waxa aad tidhi.
I did not know how.	Maan garanayn sida.
He felt that this was a bad thing.	Waxa uu dareemay in tani ay tahay wax xun.
It can be a problem.	Waxay noqon kartaa dhib.
It is beautiful here.	Way qurux badan tahay halkan.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii, ma aha runtii.
It wasn’t a lot of work, really.	Ma ahayn shaqo badan, runtii.
You may not even leave the house.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan xitaa ka bixin guriga.
Nothing close.	Wax u dhow ma jiro.
And once is enough.	Oo mar ayaa ku filan.
There is nothing we can do here.	Wax aan halkan ku qaban karno ma jirto.
You will need to do more.	Waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad wax badan samayso.
That is correct.	Taasi waa sax.
Really, really bad.	Runtii, runtii aad u xun.
I just want to know why that is.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan ogaado sababta ay taasi tahay.
Happy to be helped.	Ku faraxsan in la caawiyo.
That didn’t stop him.	Taasi ma joojin isaga.
I always assumed he was gone.	Mar walba waxaan u qaadan jiray inuu ka tagay.
I came back.	Dib ayaan u soo noqday.
I am very happy about this.	Aad ayaan ugu faraxsanahay arrintan.
No one was arrested.	Qofna ma soo qaban.
And you can be right.	Oo waxaad noqon kartaa mid sax ah.
Something like every day, there is nothing new.	Wax la mid ah maalin kasta, ma jiraan wax cusub.
John is a friend.	John waa saaxiib.
So long ago.	Sidaas dheer ka hor.
Both are false.	Labaduba waa been.
We'll see if he stays here.	Waan arki doonaa inuu halkan joogo.
And that he is.	Iyo in uu yahay.
Very close, very close.	Aad u dhow, aad u dhow.
That was obvious.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid cad.
He did not know it would happen.	Ma uu ogayn inay dhici doonto.
It’s not just work.	Kaliya maaha shaqada.
I felt so much at home.	Waxaan aad u dareemay guriga.
Nothing to see.	Wax la arki maayo.
But this is nothing.	Laakiin tani waxba maaha.
It was like that.	Waxay ahayd sidii oo kale.
I liked that	taas waan ka helay
I guess that's not true.	Waxaan filayaa inaysan run ahayn.
They are so amazing.	Aad bay u yaab badan yihiin.
That is another time.	Taasi waa wakhti kale.
There is so much more than that.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo ka badan taas.
Probably a few of them.	Malaha dhowr ka mid ah.
I am not difficult.	Ma ihi mid adag.
This is not a new problem.	Tani maaha dhibaato cusub.
A good place.	Meel fiican.
He will be here soon.	Dhawaan wuu iman doonaa halkan.
We would be together.	Waan wada joogi lahayn.
I didn’t have to do anything, really.	Ma ahayn inaan wax sameeyo, runtii.
Everyone knows where he is now.	Qof kastaa wuu garanayaa meesha uu hadda joogo.
I was very surprised that it would be so.	Aad baan ula yaabay inuu sidaas noqon doono.
It was great to work with.	Waxay ahayd wax aad u wanaagsan in lagu shaqeeyo.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Wax aad ka qaban kartaa ma jiraan.
Please tell me	Fadlan ii sheeg
Not that he had anything good to say.	Ma aha in uu lahaa wax fiican in uu sheego.
You will get it.	Waad heli doontaa.
Can someone help me?	Qof ma i caawin karaa.
There was nothing he could do there.	Ma jirin wax uu halkaas ka qaban karo.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Ma qaadan karin mar dambe.
Really beautiful too.	Runtii aad u qurux badan sidoo kale.
He is really good.	Runtii aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
I lost friends.	Waxaan waayay saaxiibo.
She did not return.	Way ku soo noqon wayday.
I tried it today.	Waxaan isku dayay maanta.
Lots of things.	Waxyaabo badan.
Take that first.	Marka hore taas qaado.
That is really a problem.	Taasi runtii waa dhib.
And obviously there is.	Oo si cad ayaa jira.
He left, much later.	Wuu baxay, wax badan ka dib.
Who knew what was going on.	Yaa ogaa waxa meesha ka jira.
That is likely to be the case.	Taasi waxay u badan tahay inay ahaan doonto.
I got that from you.	Taas adiga ayaan ka helay.
They are very bad but they are not there now.	Aad bay u xun yihiin laakiin hadda ma jiraan.
I may do this at home.	Waxa laga yaabaa in aan taas guriga ku sameeyo.
I will never see him again.	Mar dambe ma arki doono isaga.
I wanted to leave.	Waxaan rabay inaan baxo.
For the most part, this is correct.	Inta badan, tani waa sax.
She would go to a younger man.	Waxay u tagi lahayd nin ka yar.
Everything else came out of it.	Inta kale oo dhan wuu ka soo wada baxay.
Much better.	Wax badan ayaa ka fiican.
They did not succeed very much.	Si aad ah uma ay guulaysan.
I have a car	Waxaan leeyahay baabuur
You have to promise.	Waa in aad ballan qaado.
I know what that will mean for you.	Waan ogahay waxa ay taasi adiga kugu noqon doonto.
It was really hard.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid adag.
That was interesting.	Taasi waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
She probably already had.	Waxay u badan tahay inay hore u lahayd.
I have to leave	waa inaan baxo
I can believe it well	Si fiican ayaan u rumaysan karaa
I was always ready.	Had iyo jeer waxaan ahaa diyaar.
I hope this is good for you.	Waxaan rajeynayaa in tani ay kugu fiican tahay.
You will do it right.	Waxaad samayn doontaa si sax ah.
We'll see if he really does.	Waan arki doonaa haddii uu dhab ahaantii sameeyo.
There was no urgency.	Ma jirin wax degdeg ah.
No one saw it.	Cidna ma ay arag.
Maybe a man.	Malaha nin.
That surprised me.	Taas waan la yaabay.
And he got the next bit.	Oo wuxuu helay xoogaa soo socda.
I looked away	Waan iska eegay
He looks like a very good man.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa nin aad u fiican.
Nothing.	Waxba kuma jiraan.
I don't want anything else.	Wax kale ma rabo.
It was great and fun to work with.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican oo xiiso leh in la wada shaqeeyo.
She did it.	Waxa ay ku samaysay.
He should do this immediately.	Waa inuu tan si degdeg ah u sameeyaa.
Everyone wanted to talk to him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabay inuu la hadlo.
I will not talk to you again.	Mar dambe kula hadli maayo.
He is a happy person.	Waa qof faraxsan.
Something to contend with.	Wax la isku hayo.
I wanted to get it.	Waxaan rabay inaan helo.
This was not a new idea.	Tani ma ahayn fikrad cusub.
And a little surprise.	Iyo yaab yar.
I think it could be my favorite.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay noqon karto mid aan jeclahay.
I wonder who else.	Waxaan la yaabanahay cidda kale.
That is, after all, exactly what happened.	Taas oo ah, ka dib oo dhan, si sax ah waxa dhacay.
Everyone knows that.	Qof walba waa ogyahay taas.
She can only get it later.	Waxay kaliya ka dib waxay heli kartaa.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
He did not do this.	Tani ma uu samayn.
It was beautiful.	Qurux bay ahayd.
Everyone was really friendly.	Qof walba runtii saaxiib buu ahaa.
This was something new.	Tani waxay ahayd wax cusub.
Someone else.	Qof kale.
Nothing else.	Wax kale ma jiro.
But it was.	Laakiin sidaas bay ahayd.
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wakhti dheer ka hor.
But it is more than that.	Laakiin way ka badan tahay.
I will never be able to.	Weligay ma awoodi doono.
I told her she could stay with us.	Waxaan u sheegay inay nala joogi karto.
I could never do that.	Weligay ma aan samayn karin taas.
If you want.	Haddii aad rabto .
Good friend.	Mid wanaagsan saaxiib.
That's how it feels to me.	Waa sida ay aniga ila tahay.
It really looks like that.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay sidaas.
But take it, it will do.	Laakiin qaado, way yeeli doontaa.
I will do it again	mar kale ayaan samayn doonaa
No one seems to want to be there.	Qofna uma eka inuu doonayo inuu halkaas joogo.
I’m not pretty smart either.	Ma ihi caqli qurux badan sidoo kale.
It was awful.	Waxay ahayd mid aad u xun.
You are loved.	Waxaad tahay mid la jecel yahay.
That is me.	Taasi waa aniga.
She realized that this was it.	Waxay ogaatay in tani ay tahay.
Constantly beautiful.	Si joogto ah u qurux badan.
I would never do that at home.	Weligay taas guriga kuma aan samayn lahayn.
I wanna leave	Waxaan rabaa inaan baxo
I had no money	Lacag ma haysan
Very good.	Mid aad u fiican.
Now he will stop	Hadda wuu joojin doonaa
You must be very lucky.	Waa inaad aad u nasiib badan tahay.
That sounds like a bad thing and might be the same.	Taasi waxay u egtahay wax xun oo laga yaabo inay isla weyn tahay.
I love this.	Jeclahay kan.
But no one knows what you would be like.	Laakiin qofna ma garanayo sida aad noqon lahayd.
That is what we do.	Taasi waa waxa aan samayno.
What did he say to you?	Muxuu kaa yidhi.
Everything else is me.	Wax kasta oo kale waa aniga.
I am not such a man.	Anigu ma ihi nin sidaas ah.
I'm not sure if anyone else did.	Ma hubo in qof kale uu sameeyay iyo in kale.
She had.	Waxay lahayd .
I know what needs to be done.	Waan ogahay waxa ay u baahan tahay in la sameeyo.
Everyone is very happy.	Qof kastaa aad buu ugu faraxsan yahay.
It is abandoned.	Waa laga tagay.
There is so much more to me than just that.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo iga badan oo aan taas kaliya ahayn.
It is so great.	Aad buu u weyn yahay sidaas.
I think that is enough.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi ku filan tahay.
He continues.	Isaga ayaa sii wada.
What you are doing, here, now.	Waxa aad samaynayso, halkan, hadda.
I saw a lot.	Wax badan ayaan arkay.
This is awful.	Tani waa mid aad u xun.
But that is not a bad thing.	Laakiin taasi maaha waxa xun.
Everyone got it.	Qof kastaa wuu helay.
She will tell him.	Way u sheegi doontaa.
I had no idea what to talk about.	Wax aan kala hadlo maan fikrad ka haysan.
Here is the really hard one.	Halkan waa kan runtii adag.
I am not sure.	Ma hubo.
so I am with you.	sidaas ayaan kula joogaa.
I could not figure out why.	Waan awoodi waayay inaan ogaado sababta.
No wonder.	Wax la yaab leh ma leh.
It is what you like to do.	Waa waxa aad jeceshahay inaad sameyso.
I am really happy now.	Runtii aad ayaan u faraxsanahay hadda.
I saw a lot.	Wax badan ayaan arkay.
Every day, you know.	Maalin kasta, waad ogtahay.
I think so.	Waxaan qabaa taas.
The reason is unknown.	Sababta lama garanayo.
A small diet may help.	Cunto yar ayaa laga yaabaa inay ku caawiso.
Not what he wanted to see.	Ma aha wuxuu rabay inuu arko.
It was a day.	Waxay ahayd maalin.
Urgently need money	Si degdeg ah ugu baahan lacag
Both are probably not true.	Labaduba waa run malaha.
You will be at work	Waxaad noqon doontaa shaqada
She obviously loves him.	Sida cad way jeceshahay isaga.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
It’s the same for me really.	Waa isku mid aniga runtii.
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
Very happy a little.	Aad u faraxsan in yar.
I would really like to have that back.	Runtii waxaan jeclaan lahaa in taas dib loo helo.
He is afraid of me.	Wuu iga baqayaa.
She promised.	Way ballan qaaday.
She seems to have to tell him.	Waxay u egtahay inay tahay inay u sheegto.
I told him he had it.	Waxaan u sheegay inuu haysto.
You can also find many things there.	Waxaad sidoo kale ka heli kartaa waxyaabo badan.
There was no other way out.	Meel kale oo laga baxo ma jirin.
It can be a long day, he said.	Waxay noqon kartaa maalin dheer, ayuu yidhi.
Only appointment.	Ballan kaliya.
The only adult.	Qofka kaliya ee weyn.
Everything will be fine.	Wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan.
I wanted to see it every day.	Waxaan rabay inaan maalin walba arko.
I had to figure out what to do.	Waxay ahayd inaan ogaado waxaan sameeyo.
There is something else.	Wax kale ayaa jira.
Less is definitely more.	In ka yar ayaa hubaal ah in ka badan.
You need to know.	Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato.
He knows me, he said to himself.	Wuu i garanayaa, ayuu is yidhi.
I could not leave.	Waan ka bixi waayay.
And really good for that.	Oo runtii mid wanaagsan taas.
Tomorrow, maybe.	Berrito, malaha.
I did not do that.	Taas maan samayn.
If there is one right.	Haddii ay jirto mid sax ah.
I am not now	Hadda ma ihi
I will do it for you.	waan kuu samayn doonaa.
Someone I haven't seen in a long time.	Qof aan muddo dheer arag.
But, she did not leave.	Laakiin, way ka bixi wayday.
The reason is uncertain.	Sababta lama hubo.
I will find you.	Waan kuu heli doonaa.
miyuu.	miyuu .
I refused to see.	Waan diiday inaan arko.
But the former did too.	Laakiin kii hore ayaa sidoo kale sameeyay.
He would be someone going somewhere.	Waxa uu noqon lahaa qof meel u socda.
And a lot of them.	Iyo wax badan oo ka mid ah.
He would stay for a while.	Wuu joogi lahaa wakhti.
I am very happy to have you here.	Aad baan ugu faraxsanahay inaan halkaan kugu haysto.
That's how bad they are.	Taasi waa sida ay u xun yihiin.
There is no more.	Ma jiro in ka badan.
What happened.	Maxaa ku dhacay.
This can be a bit surprising.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa xoogaa la yaab leh.
I told you.	waan kuu sheegay.
I have a little one with.	Waxaan leeyahay kan yar oo leh.
It would be a great job for me.	Waxay ii noqon lahayd shaqo aad u fiican.
It is extortion.	Waa baad.
He may not get a chance anymore.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inuusan mar dambe fursad u helin.
But she refused to do so.	Laakiin way diiday inay sidaas samayso.
You really can't tell but.	Dhab ahaantii ma sheegi kartid laakiin.
Someone will give it to him.	Qof ayaa siin doona isaga.
There is nothing more false.	Ma jiraan wax ka been badan.
This is not always true.	Tani mar walba run maaha.
But they need to do more as well.	Laakiin waxay u baahan yihiin inay wax badan sameeyaan sidoo kale.
But it was a lie.	Laakiin been bay ahayd.
And he went out early.	Oo goor hore ayuu baxay.
I can't.	Ma awoodi karto.
he was not ready	diyaar uma ahayn
I didn’t think it could be anything else.	Uma malaynayn inay wax kale noqon karto.
Will they succeed?	Ma guulaysan doonaan?.
The door, me.	Albaabka, aniga.
They are bad for me.	Way ii xun yihiin.
I just couldn't take it.	Kaliya waan qaadan waayay.
there we will see you	halkaas ayaan kugu arki doonaa
Not so.	Ma aha sidaas oo kale.
As it should be.	Sida ay tahay in aan.
For him, they are already.	Isaga, waxay hore u yihiin.
Nothing like that has happened so far.	Ma jiraan wax sidaas u dhacay hadda.
He knows nothing else.	Wax kale ma yaqaan.
How are you? 	Sidee tahay?
.	.
It can be hard work.	Waxay noqon kartaa shaqo adag.
You just can't do that.	Kaliya taas ma sameyn kartid.
She refused.	Way diiday.
Something is better than nothing.	Wax baa ka fiican waxba.
It is also the right thing to do.	Sidoo kale waa wax sax ah in la sameeyo.
He is very good.	Aad ayuu u fiican yahay.
It is still too early	Wali waa hore
Maybe she does everything.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay wax walba sameyso.
But that was a long time ago.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd wakhti hore.
I will find a job somewhere.	Meel baan shaqo ka heli doonaa.
Only a great man who would do everything for you.	Kaliya nin weyn oo wax walba kuu qaban lahaa.
This was unfortunate.	Tani waxay ahayd nasiib xun.
I am so sorry for this.	Aad baan ugu xumahay tan.
No one said.	Qofna ma sheegin.
That's enough for me	Waxa igu filan
That is right for me.	Taasi waa iga sax.
Otherwise, it is one lucky one.	Haddii kale, waa hal nasiib leh.
But it will come back.	Laakiin way soo noqon doontaa.
Something terrible happened.	Waxyaabo aad u xun ayaa dhacay.
Tan yar.	Tan yar.
Let him know.	Ha ogaado.
He said he was a friend.	Wuxuu yidhi waa saaxiib.
I became very difficult.	Waxaan noqday mid aad u adag.
Hard, but doable.	Adag, laakiin la samayn karo.
She still thinks.	Weli way u malaynaysaa.
There’s a lot to do here, too.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo la sameeyo halkan, sidoo kale.
I bought something.	Waxa aan wax ku iibsaday.
There is none.	Ma jirto.
Probably not.	Malaha ma lahayn.
And very beautiful.	Oo aad u qurux badan.
That is when you realize it is real.	Taasi waa marka aad ogaato inay dhab tahay.
What is it? 	Waa maxay?
I will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayo.
That is the main thing.	Taasi waa waxa ugu weyn.
And, what happened.	Iyo, maxaa dhacay.
But this was something else.	Laakiin tani waxay ahayd wax kale.
This is who she is.	Tani waa qofka ay tahay.
But now it is not true.	Laakiin hadda ma ahan run.
You know he has.	Waad ogtahay inuu leeyahay.
It's really a lot of money.	Runtii waa lacag aad u badan.
And it is the same.	Iyo sidoo kale waa isku mid.
But if you want to, that's fine.	Laakiin haddii aad rabto, taasi waa fiican tahay.
Again he could not find it correctly.	Mar kale ayuu si sax ah u heli waayay.
You did that.	Waad samaysay taas.
He is the most.	Isaga ayaa ugu badan.
It's small.	Way yar tahay.
It can't be real.	Ma noqon karto mid dhab ah.
Maybe it was something else.	Malaha waxay ahayd wax kale.
Loved it so far.	Jeclahay ilaa hadda.
He has to do the right thing.	Waa inuu wax sax ah samaynayo.
One of all.	Mid ka mid ah dhammaan.
It just won’t happen.	Kaliya ma dhici doonto.
Please, please, please.	Fadlan, fadlan, fadlan.
He should not have.	Waa inuusan lahayn.
That's how he felt.	Sidaas ayuu dareemay.
You had close friends.	Waxaad ku lahayd saaxiibo dhow.
She would do something about it.	Wax bay iska samayn lahayd.
He looked and it was there.	Wuu eegay oo waa halkaas.
Now I want him here.	Hadda waxaan rabaa isaga halkan.
He did not understand.	Ma uu fahmin.
They may not be all at once.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aanay mar wada ahayn.
I'm sure he has a lot.	Waxaan hubaa inuu wax badan haysto.
That is the only thing they need to be there.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee loo baahan yahay inay halkaas ku jiraan.
Still, they did not stop.	Weli, ma ay joojin.
If someone has something better.	Haddii qof uu haysto wax ka fiican.
I can tell you whatever it is.	Waxaan kuu sheegi karaa wax kasta oo ay tahay.
He is a good enough friend.	Waa saaxiib ku filan.
Yes, he left.	Waa sidaas, wuu ka tagay.
After a while I will get better.	Wax yar ka dib waan fiicnaan doonaa.
How good is that?!.	Sidee u fiican taasi?!.
Take my time.	Waqti iga qaado.
I did it for you.	waan ku sameeyay.
Now there was another.	Hadda mid kale ayaa jiray.
He had already decided to talk a little.	Waxa uu mar hore go'aansaday in uu wax yar ka hadlo.
Still in it.	Weli waxa ku jira.
He has to learn from it.	Waa inuu wax ka barto.
But that will end soon.	Laakiin taasi waxay dhammaan doontaa dhawaan.
Everyone would like more.	Qof kastaa wuu jeclaan lahaa in ka sii badan.
Always him, really.	Had iyo jeer isaga, dhab ahaantii.
This was interesting.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xiiso leh.
We are friends, after all.	Waxaan nahay saaxiibo, ka dib oo dhan.
I looked again.	Mar kale ayaan eegay.
I think they are not.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inaysan ahayn.
Something beautiful for you.	Wax qurux badan adiga.
I found it very bad.	Waxaan u arkay inay aad u xun tahay.
He thought it was true.	Waxa uu u maleeyay in ay run tahay.
You may want some money from time to time.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaad rabto xoogaa lacag ah waqti ka waqti.
It is unbelievable.	Waa wax aan la rumaysan karin.
And now, here it is.	Oo hadda, waa kan.
This was doable.	Tani waxay ahayd mid la samayn karo.
I think it will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
Everyone wanted him.	Qof walba waxa uu rabay isaga.
He would be fine.	Wuu fiicnaan lahaa.
But that is also not true.	Laakiin taasi sidoo kale sax maaha.
But it may not be so.	Laakiin waxaa laga yaabaa inaysan sidoo kale noqon.
I just can't.	Kaliya ma awoodo.
No one is really sure what they are.	Qofna runtii ma hubo waxay yihiin.
This was.	Tani waxay ahayd.
I think it's right.	Waxaan filayaa inay sax tahay.
It could be early.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid hore.
It’s all hard now.	Dhammaan hadda waa adag yihiin.
Everything would be better than that.	Wax kasta ayaa ka fiicnaan lahaa taas.
He felt it was not in him.	Waxa uu dareemay in aanay isaga ku jirin.
I think it's too much.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u badan tahay.
I took a lot.	Waxaan qaatay wax badan.
It was every day.	Waxay ahayd maalin kasta.
No one really knows.	Qofna runtii ma garanayo.
Let him say what he wants.	Ha sheego wuxuu rabo.
That would be a problem.	Taasi waxay ahaan lahayd dhibaato.
This was enough.	Tani waxay ahayd mid ku filan.
I really hope someone can help.	Runtii waxaan rajeynayaa in qof ku caawin karo.
That's right for me.	Waa sax aniga.
That was a bad thing.	Taasi waxay ahayd wax xun.
It's good for me.	Way ii fiican tahay aniga.
You can tell me more.	Wax badan baad ii sheegi kartaa.
That's right.	Sax ayaa ii baxay.
I hope he knows that.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu taas garanayo.
Like everything else.	Sida wax kasta oo kale.
How close they are.	Sidee isku dhow yihiin.
I'm not sure what to say about that.	Ma hubo waxa laga sheego taas.
He liked it clearly.	Cad ayuu ka helay.
This is going to be great.	Tani waxay noqon doontaa mid weyn.
He was surprised by what he saw.	Wuxuu la yaabay wuxuu arkay.
It looks so good.	Waxay u egtahay mid aad u wanaagsan.
It will not happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici doonto.
If only it would help us.	Haddii ay xitaa na caawin doonto.
People are coming.	Dadka ayaa soo socda.
Something is not right here	Wax aan halkan sax ahayn
Surely there is something else.	Hubaal inay jirto wax kale.
Obviously this is a big problem.	Sida cad tani waa dhib weyn.
But it is not to be helped.	Laakiin maaha in la caawiyo.
I started with one.	Mid baan ku bilaabay.
I went to the door.	Albaabka ayaan aaday.
There is so much.	Wax badan baa jira.
We would do it	Waanu samayn lahayn
This is a big problem for me.	Tani waa dhibaato weyn aniga.
It's me and you.	Waa aniga iyo adiga.
Few are true.	In yar ayaa run ah.
There is more than one	Waxaa jira in ka badan hal
It was really great.	Dhab ahaantii waxay ahayd mid aad u wanaagsan.
Everyone made the door.	Qof kastaa wuxuu sameeyay albaabka.
All man.	Oo dhan nin.
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.	Aad ayaan u hubaa inaysan ahayn.
I have to wonder how accurate this is.	Waa inaan la yaabanahay sida ay tani sax u tahay.
Something went wrong.	Wax baa ku dhacay dhib.
True, but that is not the end of the story.	Run, laakiin taasi kuma dhammaan.
The reason for this is unknown.	Sababta arrintan lama garanayo.
Well, isn't it?	Fiican, miyaanay ahayn?.
This is where everyone went.	Tani waa meesha qof kastaa aaday.
She will not do it again.	Mar dambe ma samaynayso.
That may be true.	Taasi waxay noqon kartaa run.
He did a lot.	Wax badan buu sameeyay.
This can be unnecessary.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa mid aan loo baahnayn.
It has to be very good to tell the truth.	Waa inay aad u wanaagsan tahay in run la sheego.
They live with it.	Waxay la nool yihiin.
He needs more.	Wuxuu u baahan yahay wax badan.
He had a good time.	Waqti fiican ayuu qaatay.
I have never really seen one.	Weligay runtii mid maan arag.
It’s all about you.	Waa adiga oo dhan.
It really looks new.	Dhab ahaantii waxay u egtahay mid cusub.
I hope it will happen now.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inay hadda dhici doonto.
He looked very much.	Aad buu u eegay.
There is no such thing !.	Wax kale oo la mid ah ma jiro!.
That's really amazing.	Runtii taasi waa yaab.
Probably.	Waxay u badan tahay inay tahay.
You are a little man.	Nin yar baad tahay.
I would love it.	Aad baan u jeclaan lahaa.
I have no problem with this, most of the time.	Wax dhib ah igama haysto arrintan, inta badan.
The same.	Isla sidaas oo kale.
But it was amazing.	Laakiin waxay ahayd wax la yaab leh.
He always does.	Mar walba wuu sameeyaa.
They do that before they do anything else.	Waxay sameeyaan in ka hor inta aysan wax kale samayn.
Someone is coming.	Qof baa u soo socda.
I do not know what to say.	Ma garanayo waxaan u sheego.
And really a good idea.	Oo runtii fikrad fiican.
The good thing was very little.	Wax fiican bay ahayd mid aad u yar.
It's good, but it's definitely not the best.	Way fiican tahay, laakiin hubaal maaha kan ugu fiican.
You can talk to him.	Waad la hadli kartaa isaga.
Beautiful things.	Waxyaabo qurux badan.
That is a bad idea.	Taasi waa fikrad xun.
No one has seen him today.	Qofna ma arag isaga maanta.
That is for sure someone who will never get it.	Taasi waa hubaal qof aan waligiis heli doonin.
I don't understand, really.	Ma fahmin, runtii.
I think not.	Waxaan u maleynayaa ma aha.
They do this every day for a while.	Waxay tan sameeyaan maalin kasta in muddo ah.
It's amazing to me.	Waa wax la yaab leh aniga.
Afterwards, he disappeared.	Ka dib, waa la waayay.
But there was something else.	Laakiin wax kale ayaa jiray.
Tell me now.	Hadda ii sheeg.
He could not think of anything else.	Wax kale ma uu malayn karin.
That was unsuccessful.	Taasi waa lagu guulaysan waayay.
Now, let me help you.	Hadda, aan ku caawiyo.
It was beautiful, very nice.	Waxay ahayd mid qurux badan, aad u fiican.
I'm sorry about that !.	Waan ka xumahay taas!.
It was up to here.	Waxay ahayd ilaa halkan.
There is still so much.	Weli wax badan ayaa jira.
I have no idea how to do that.	Wax fikrad ah uma hayo sidii aan taas u samayn lahaa.
They will see each other.	Way is arki doonaan.
That can happen, it can't happen.	Taasi way dhici kartaa, taasi ma dhici karto.
We would leave tomorrow.	Berri ayaan bixi lahayn.
She said she is.	Waxay sheegtay inay tahay.
That has always been a problem.	Taasi had iyo jeer waxay ahayd dhibaato.
Each was placed somewhere else.	Mid walba waxa la dhigay meel kale.
Everyone loves that.	Qof kastaa wuu jecel yahay taas.
Maybe better than any other.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in ka fiican mid kasta oo kale.
Very available	Aad ayaa loo heli karaa
And you have this great.	Oo waxaad leedahay tan weyn.
I will not do it again.	Anigu mar dambe ma samayn doono.
Maybe it was different.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay si kale u ahayd.
He said that was true.	Waxa uu sheegay in ay taasi run tahay.
Most of the time it didn’t come back.	Inta badan dib uma soo bixin.
Three other men were spotted.	Saddex nin oo kale ayaa la arkay.
But that was it.	Laakiin taasi waxay ahayd.
Maybe that's what you want.	Ma laga yaabaa in waxa la doonayo.
I have a lot to say to you.	Wax badan baan ku leeyahay.
Nothing else was found.	Wax kale oo la helay ma jirin.
You can reverse that.	Taas ayaad dib uga noqon kartaa.
I looked.	Waan eegay.
This was a very good job.	Tani waxay ahayd shaqo aad u wanaagsan.
I knew he would come.	Waan ogaa inuu iman doono.
He left it all.	Waa uu ka tagay dhammaan.
It was a bad day.	Waxay ahayd maalin xun.
It is always so.	Had iyo jeer waa sidaas oo kale.
Why not.	Maxaa u diiday .
I am a regular.	Waxaan ahay mid joogto ah.
Each other.	Mid kasta oo kale.
Everyone would like to make a lot of money.	Qof kastaa wuxuu jeclaan lahaa inuu sameeyo lacag badan.
He will win.	Wuu guulaysan doonaa.
This was correct.	Tani sax bay ahayd.
There is no such thing.	Wax kale oo la mid ah ma jiro.
In fact, this is true everywhere.	Dhab ahaantii, tani run bay ka tahay meel kasta.
She had no money.	Wax lacag ah ma ay haysan.
That is done.	Taasi waa la sameeyaa.
No matter how bad they are, this is what it is.	Si kasta oo ay u xun yihiin, tani waa waxa ay tahay.
Hold on tight to him.	Aad u qabo isaga.
It is beautiful and very interesting.	Waa qurux badan oo aad u xiiso badan.
But he did.	Laakiin wuu sameeyay.
He is very smart.	Aad ayuu u caqli badan yahay.
Whatever he says.	Wax kasta oo uu sheego.
Now he is gone.	Hadda wuu baxay.
I know what you really need.	Waan ogahay waxaad runtii u baahan tahay.
Not so long ago.	Ma aha waqti dheer ka hor.
There were other good things as well.	Waxaa jiray waxyaabo kale oo wanaagsan sidoo kale.
But so does everyone else.	Laakiin sidaas oo kale qof kasta oo kale.
More than me.	In ka badan aniga.
I think it will get better.	Waxaan filayaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
Not much trouble now.	Dhib badan maaha hadda.
She says I don't like you.	Waxay tidhi kuma jecli.
There was no appointment.	Ballan ma jirin.
As a person.	Sida qofka.
I'm sure he'll be fine with that.	Waxaan hubaa inuu taas ku fiicnaan doono.
Surprisingly, they do.	Si la yaab leh, way sameeyaan.
So far there are no surprises.	Ilaa hadda ma jiraan wax la yaab leh oo xun.
I think it is very beautiful.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
But after a while.	Laakiin wax yar ka dib,.
And, there is no such thing.	Oo, ma jiraan wax la mid ah.
Maybe not later.	Laga yaabaa in aan mar dambe.
But there is no truth.	Laakiin ma jiraan wax run ah.
It's the same.	Waa isku mid.
Bad lies.	Been xun.
Now it is like that.	Hadda waa sidaas oo kale.
It would never happen again.	Mar dambe ma dhici lahayd.
Not everyone wants it.	Qof walba ma doonayo.
I still refuse.	Wali waan diiday.
He will love whatever you do.	Wax kasta oo aad ku samayso wuu jeclaan doonaa.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doono.
This is a must see !.	Tani waa in la arko!.
I wanted to help people.	Waxaan rabay inaan caawiyo dadka.
It was really true.	Runtii run bay ahayd.
Can you tell me why this is please.	Ma ii sheegi kartaa sababta tani u tahay fadlan.
Good idea.	Fikrad fiican.
But I'm not sure.	Laakiin ma hubo.
He did better than anyone else.	Waxa uu sameeyay si ka wanaagsan qof kasta oo kale.
that is it.	waa taas .
No one saw anything.	Qofna waxba ma arag.
I thought it was you.	Waxaan u maleeyay inaad tahay adiga.
What a hurry.	Maxaa degdeg u ahaa.
I didn't want him to go.	Ma aanan rabin inuu tago.
We were good friends.	Waxaan ahayn saaxiibo wanaagsan.
Do the work.	Qabo shaqada.
There was a lot going on.	Waxyaabo badan baa meesha ku jiray.
I wanted to work.	Waxaan rabay inaan shaqeeyo.
Not yet available	Wali lama heli karo
This really is not surprising.	Runtii tani maaha wax la yaab leh.
With you.	Adiga kula jira .
You did.	Waad samaysay.
They are great.	Way weyn yihiin.
This was correct.	Tani waxay ahayd mid sax ah.
Once we were friends.	Mar waxaan ahayn saaxiibo.
I liked it very much	si fiican ayaan uga helay
There was nothing else I could do.	Wax kale oo aan sameeyo ma jirin.
I should have said that a long time ago.	Waxay ahayd in aan sidaas u sheego wakhti hore.
He got into it a lot.	Aad ayuu u galay.
He can be very happy.	Wuxuu noqon karaa mid aad u faraxsan.
As well as beauty.	Iyo sidoo kale qurux.
There is none.	Ma jirto.
Probably very close.	Aad u dhow malaha.
I think it will be.	Waxaan filayaa inuu ahaan doono.
Even if it was true.	Xitaa haddii ay run ahayd.
But then he returned.	Laakiin ka dib wuu noqday.
As he does.	Sida uu sameeyo.
But otherwise, it is a problem.	Laakiin si kale, waa dhibaato.
There is no such thing.	Ma jiro wax la mid ah.
Tell them you like it.	U sheeg inaad jeceshahay.
Always, but never seen.	Had iyo jeer, laakiin ma ay arag.
Very beautiful	Aad u qurux badan
I had little.	Wax yar baan ku lahaa.
No one could talk.	Qofna ma hadli karin.
It would be nice if someone could help me.	Way fiicnaan lahayd haddii qof i caawiyo.
As everyone was.	Sida qof walba ahaa.
Maybe it's me.	Malaha waa aniga.
After all he did for me.	Wax kasta oo uu ii sameeyay ka dib.
But he loves him.	Laakiin wuu jecel yahay isaga.
I just don't want to.	Kaliya ma rabo.
But there is no chance.	Laakiin ma jirto fursad.
I just know he is still alive.	Waxaan ogahay kaliya inuu weli nool yahay.
He found time to work.	Wuxuu helay waqti uu ku shaqeeyo.
No one left.	Qofna ma tagin.
He tried.	Wuu isku dayay.
Now it is another, and another, and another.	Hadda waa mid kale, iyo mid kale, iyo mid kale.
She would leave.	Way bixi lahayd.
Somehow, he did.	Si ahaan, wuu sameeyay.
I could not find it correctly.	Si sax ah ayaan u heli waayay.
I'm really sorry.	Runtii aad baan uga xumahay.
I hope you are in a better place now.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inaad hadda joogto meel ka wanaagsan.
It looks right.	Waxay u egtahay sax.
I really am not.	Runtii ma ihi.
I was very surprised.	Aad baan ula yaabay.
Maybe she is here.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay halkan la joogto.
Keep it up there.	Halkaas ku sii.
It would be nice.	Way fiicnaan lahayd.
I know I really do.	Waan ogahay inaan dhab ahaantii sameeyo.
I have to do everything right.	Waa inaan sameeyaa wax walba oo sax ah.
But I did not.	Laakiin ma samayn.
I'm sure you will do well !.	Waxaan hubaa inaad si fiican wax u qaban doonto!.
Very interesting work.	Shaqo aad u xiiso badan.
Beautiful day.	Maalin qurux badan.
You can always come back.	Mar walba waad soo noqon kartaa.
It will be very good.	Aad bay u fiicnaan doontaa.
Not everyone.	Ma aha qofka oo dhan.
He had no idea what he saw.	Wax fikrad ah uma lahayn wuxuu arkay.
I still love it	Wali waan jeclahay
That was probably.	Taasi waxay ahayd malaha.
It could not be.	Ma noqon karin.
He would be here tomorrow.	Berri ayuu halkan joogi lahaa.
There was nowhere else to leave.	Meel kale oo aan uga tago ma jirin.
And not so close.	Oo aan sidaas u dhow.
She can be happy again.	Waxay noqon kartaa mid faraxsan mar kale.
That's what it looks like.	Taasi waa sida ay u egtahay.
I think that's the best.	Waxaan filayaa inay taasi tahay waxa ugu wanaagsan.
It is definitely not available right now.	Waa hubaal in aan hadda la heli karin.
Nice to see you.	Waan ku faraxsanahay inaan arko.
He looked so good.	Waxa uu u muuqday mid aad u fiican.
I was ready to go home.	Waxa aan diyaar u ahaa in aan guriga aado.
But one saw.	Laakiin mid baa arkay.
It's really a lot.	Runtii aad bay u badan tahay.
It was busy.	Mashquul bay ahayd.
One of us.	Mid naga mid ah.
Maybe I should have known that.	Malaha waxay ahayd inaan taas ogaado.
I was really home	Runtii waxaan ahaa guriga
I have several.	Waxaan leeyahay dhowr.
And he has not been there for a while.	Oo in muddo ah ma uu joogin.
So far so good.	Ilaa hadda aad u wanaagsan.
I know you did.	Waan ogahay inaad samaysay.
I took it.	Waan qaaday.
She really couldn't.	Run ahaantii way awoodi wayday.
But only a few.	Laakiin kaliya dhowr.
He went on strike.	Waxa uu sameeyay shaqo joojin.
I'm really impressed so far.	Runtii aad ayaan ula dhacay ilaa hadda.
Maybe they are smarter.	Malaha waa caqli badan yihiin.
If someone wants to do things on their own, that's fine.	Haddii qof doonayo inuu keligiis wax sameeyo, waa fiican yahay.
It’s all we do.	Waa waxa aan samayno oo dhan.
Even a little he can believe.	Xitaa in yar oo uu rumaysan karo.
Not sure about him, already.	Ma hubo isaga, mar hore.
Little did the same.	Yar ayaa sidaas oo kale sameeyay.
I will not do so.	Anigu sidaas yeeli maayo.
This is correct for me	Tani waa iga sax
He was a tall man.	Nin dheer buu ahaa.
I really like it	Runtii waan jeclahay
I may still do that.	Weli waxaa laga yaabaa inaan taas sameeyo.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
No one really knew that.	Runtii taas qofna ma ogayn.
Another one .	Mid kale .
He came to me.	Wuu ii yimid.
Only you lied to me.	Kaliya adiga ayaa been ii sheegay.
Let me find out.	Aan wax ka ogaado.
I’ve never seen anything so big and fast going.	Weligay ma arag wax sidaas u weyn oo si degdeg ah u socda.
Good thing there were three of us.	Wax wanaagsan waxaa jiray saddex naga mid ah.
He started out bigger.	Wuxuu ku bilaabay si ka weyn.
I love speed	Waxaan jeclahay degdeg
They will not hurt you.	Waxba kuma yeeli doonaan.
We are always serious about what we do.	Waxaan mar walba dhab ka nahay waxa aan samayno.
That is not what you said.	Runtii taasi maaha waxaad tidhi.
He was real.	Wuxuu ahaa dhab.
It has been tried.	Waa la isku dayay.
And more.	Iyo in ka badan .
One came out.	Mid baa soo baxay.
She did not want to be here.	Ma aysan rabin halkan.
It is not so difficult.	Ma aha sidaas u adag.
Wherever he went, he had nothing to do.	Meel uu aado, wax uu sameeyo ma jirin.
But they found nothing.	Laakiin waxba ma ay helin.
She told me she loved me.	Waxay ii sheegtay inay i jeceshahay.
She can tell me what to do, she can help you.	Waxay ii sheegi kartaa waxaan sameeyo, way ku caawin kartaa.
Maybe it could be smarter.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay noqon karto mid caqli badan.
There are things that are not free.	Waxa jira waxyaabo aan lacag ahayn.
I seem to not get it.	Waxaan u muuqdaa inaanan helin.
You may not be able to see it.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan arki karin.
Maybe it's a lot more amazing.	Malaha waa wax aad iyo aad uga yaab badan.
She also said you can get food.	Waxa kale oo ay sheegtay in aad heli karto cunto.
This was the only thing he had now.	Tani waxay ahayd waxa kaliya ee uu hadda haysto.
That is all you need to know.	Taasi waa waxa kaliya ee ay tahay inaad ogaato.
But that's another.	Laakiin taasi kale.
I was not ready for this now.	Hadda diyaar uma ahayn kan.
Good on that.	Ku fiican taas.
First, they are very complex.	Marka hore, aad bay u dhib badan yihiin.
This is more than true now.	Tani waa wax ka badan run hadda.
It had to be done already.	Waxay ahayd in la sameeyo mar hore.
But that is not surprising.	Laakiin sidaas la yaab ma leh.
I really like it.	Runtii waan jeclahay.
It is difficult to know what it is.	Way adag tahay in la ogaado waxa uu yahay.
Very large for one person.	Aad ugu weyn hal qof.
Here he is with me.	Halkan aniga ayuu ila leeyahay.
But always money.	Laakiin had iyo jeer lacag.
.	.
Both for me.	Labaduba aniga.
I felt so bad	Aad baan u dareemay
But that is not the right idea.	Laakiin taasi ma aha fikrad sax ah.
This was a real problem.	Tani waxay ahayd dhibaato dhab ah.
After all, it was really a beautiful day.	Ka dib oo dhan, runtii waxay ahayd maalin qurux badan.
You can leave if you want.	Waad bixi kartaa haddii aad rabto.
Why also.	Waa maxay sababta sidoo kale.
It was there.	Halkaas bay ahayd.
Obviously not as much.	Sida iska cad maaha sida ugu badan.
That's right, as always.	Waa sax, sida uu had iyo jeer yahay.
I will do it tonight.	caawa ayaan samayn doonaa.
More than anything else,.	Wax kasta oo kale ka badan,.
But someone did.	Laakiin qof baa sameeyay.
I could not see anything.	Waxba maan arki karin.
I know.	waan garanayaa.
I like it.	Waan ka helay.
No one wants it.	Qofna kuma rabo.
It was something to do.	Waxay ahayd wax la sameeyo.
It is still very small.	Wali aad bay u yar tahay.
Anything you may need	Wax kasta oo aad u baahan karto
I am very busy	mashquul badan ayaan ahay
Maybe not what you want.	Malaha ma waxaad rabto.
Now he was.	Hadda wuu ahaa.
Here, it’s a lot of the same thing, really.	Halkan, waa wax aad u badan oo isku mid ah, runtii.
I didn't even like him.	Xitaa maan jeclayn isaga.
That is not who we are.	Taasi maaha cidda aan nahay.
It is here	Waa halkan
They are small and smart.	Way yar yihiin oo caqli badan yihiin .
I'm sure it will be fine.	Waxaan hubaa inay fiicnaan doonto.
He can go tomorrow.	Berrito wuu tagi karaa.
Unable to come up with anything.	Aan awoodin in uu wax la yimaado.
He was very impressed.	Aad iyo aad buu ula dhacay.
Something bad will happen.	Wax xun ayaa dhici doona.
I can't do it.	Ma samayn karo.
I'm afraid to see it.	Waxaan ka baqayaa inaan arko.
There was not much, but there was something.	Wax badan kuma jirin, laakiin wax baa jiray.
I am not.	Anigu ma ihi.
I know you really like it here.	Waan ogahay inaad runtii halkan jeceshahay.
Hard stuff really.	Waxyaabo adag runtii.
I just want to tell you what they do.	Kaliya waxaan rabaa inaan kuu sheego waxay sameeyaan.
Maybe again, one day.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inay mar kale, maalin.
It will do nothing else.	Wax kale ma yeeli doono.
A little beautiful.	Wax yar oo qurux badan.
Now, I have no one.	Hadda, qofna ma haysto.
There is no better time.	Ma jiro waqti ka wanaagsan.
That is how they will do it.	Taasi waa sida ay yeeli doonaan.
But he is fine.	Laakiin wuu fiican yahay.
I think this is really a very bad idea.	Waxaan filayaa in tani ay runtii tahay fikrad aad u xun.
Maybe several.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in dhowr ka mid ah.
But she rejected him.	Laakiin way diiday isaga.
I became.	waxaan noqday .
But you have to do it right.	Laakiin waa inaad si sax ah u sameyso.
I'm bothering you	dhib baan kugu ahay
I'm sorry.	ma ka xumahay.
That is the door.	Taasi waa albaabka.
This is difficult.	Tani waa mid adag.
I told him he could come anywhere.	Waxaan u sheegay inuu iman karo meel kasta.
I still love him.	Wali waan jeclahay isaga.
He just doesn’t want to go home yet.	Kaliya ma doonayo inuu guriga aado weli.
Make time.	Waqti u qabo.
It would take him.	Way qaadan lahayd isaga.
I looked at the house.	Waxaan eegay guriga.
Finding out is a daunting task.	In la ogaado waa shaqo adag.
Everyone wants to help him.	Qof kastaa wuxuu rabaa inuu caawiyo isaga.
I hope it works well.	Waxaan rajeynayaa inuu si fiican u shaqeeyo.
For you, it is not too much.	Adiga, aad uma badna.
She was ready for this.	Waxay diyaar u ahayd tan.
I want you to be here with me.	Waxaan rabaa inaad halkaan ila joogto.
Small, old.	Yar, oo hore.
It sounds like a good idea.	Waxay u egtahay fikrad wanaagsan.
Tomorrow is another day.	Berri waa maalin kale.
Who does not like to learn the best.	Yaa aan jeclayn inuu wax ka barto waxa ugu fiican.
That is where he came from.	Waa halka uu ka yimid.
She was the same man, she was.	Waxay ahayd isku nin, waxay ahayd.
This is very, very difficult.	Tani waa mid aad iyo aad u adag.
Take it, take it.	Qaado, qaado.
I am, right now, just like you.	Waxaan ahay, hadda, adiga oo kale.
They are definitely interesting.	Waa hubaal inay xiiso badan yihiin.
I don't have to.	Ma aha inaan.
I want to know more.	Waxaan rabaa inaan wax badan ogaado.
But this is not the case.	Laakiin tan kale maaha.
They will look good as new.	Waxay u fiicnaan doonaan sida cusub.
But it really isn't.	Laakiin runtii maaha.
In other words, it is a blatant lie.	Si kale haddii loo sheego waa been cad.
Obviously you like him.	Waxaa cad in aad isaga jeceshahay.
Just amazing! 	Kaliya yaab leh!
It's a beautiful job.	Waa shaqo qurux badan.
Everyone looks happy.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqdaa mid faraxsan.
She could see nothing.	Waxba ma ay arki karin.
Like everyone else.	Sida qof kasta oo kale.
Much smarter.	Wax badan ka caqli badan.
Maybe you are fine now.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in aad hadda wanaagsan tahay.
I also can't see.	Sidoo kale ma awoodo inaan arko.
Fast time, but here it is.	Waqti degdeg ah, laakiin waa kan.
Maybe it's true.	Malaha waa run.
That is very interesting.	Taasi waa wax aad u xiiso badan.
Tom heard a lot.	Tom wax badan ayuu maqlay.
Everyone would do the same.	Qof kastaa sidaas oo kale ayuu samayn lahaa.
But I need more money.	Laakiin waxaan u baahanahay lacag badan.
Maybe we should do something interesting.	Waxaa laga yaabaa inaan samayn lahayn wax xiiso leh.
In addition to now.	Marka laga soo tago hadda.
It would be.	Waxay noqon lahayd.
Owned by ???.	Waxaa iska leh???.
That will be a problem.	Taasi waxay noqon doontaa dhibaato.
Surprisingly, both are true.	Yaab, labaduba waa run.
I think it will be.	Waxaan filayaa inay ahaan doonto.
You can make some money.	Waxaad samayn kartaa xoogaa lacag ah.
You know, if he did.	Waad ogtahay, haddii uu sameeyay.
He is really a good friend.	Runtii waa saaxiib wanaagsan.
But that would come.	Laakiin taasi way iman lahayd.
She said he was a friend.	Waxay tidhi waa saaxiib.
Very well known.	Oo aad loo yaqaan.
That is to be eaten.	Taasi waa in la cuno.
I have good friends.	Waxaan leeyahay saaxiibo wanaagsan.
He would leave the room.	Qolka ayuu ka bixi lahaa.
He leaned forward a little.	Wax yar ayuu is hor dhigay.
It just doesn’t look like it.	Kaliya uma eka .
This was.	Tani waxay ahayd.
There is no other way.	Si kale oo loo sheego ma jirto.
I am nothing.	Anigu waxba ma ihi.
I think he knows better now.	Waxaan u maleynayaa inuu hadda si fiican u yaqaan.
I know how I should have nothing.	Waan ogahay sida ay tahay inaan waxba haysan.
I found	waan helay
I would like to talk to you.	Waxaan jeclaan lahaa inaan la hadlo.
I found it here.	halkaan ayaan ka helay.
No one can say what it will be like.	Qofna ma sheegi karo sida uu noqon doono.
He said he owes everything.	Wuxuu sheegay inuu wax walba ku leeyahay.
But now, who knows.	Laakiin hadda, yaa yaqaan.
Are you OK?.	Ma wanaagsan tahay?.
Fast.	Mid degdeg ah.
Everyone wants it all.	Qof kastaa wuu rabaa dhammaan.
It was really great.	Runtii waxay ahayd mid aad u fiican.
And not just once.	Oo aan ahayn hal mar.
But that is not all.	Laakiin taasi weli kuma dhammaan.
I don't like it, really.	Ma jecli, runtii.
Everything will be fine.	Wax walba way fiicnaan doonaan.
I'm afraid not.	Waxaan ka baqayaa in aan.
If you like this, you will love this one.	Haddii aad taas jeceshahay, waad jeclaan doontaa kan.
In fact, there was none.	Runtii, ma jirin.
You said you would come back.	Waxaad sheegtay inaad soo noqon doonto.
Good time there friends.	Waqti fiican halkaas saaxiibo.
This she did not get.	Tani ma aysan helin.
Like, that doesn’t even matter here.	Sida, taasi xitaa halkan wax maaha.
All you have to do is.	Dhammaan waa inaad sameyso.
She thinks she is still very young.	Waxay u malaynaysaa inay weli aad u yar tahay.
It was just.	Waxay ahayd kaliya.
It's really real.	Waa dhab dhab.
Just an appointment.	Kaliya ballan.
Everyone seemed to be doing the same thing.	Qof kastaa wuxuu u muuqday inuu sidaas oo kale samaynayo.
This was bad.	Tani waxay ahayd mid xun.
I don't work that way.	Anigu sidaas uma shaqeeyo.
Obviously you did.	Sida cad waad samaysay.
But he does.	Laakiin wuu sameeyaa.
No one knows who they are.	Qofna ma garanayo cidda ay yihiin.
It was a difficult day.	Waxay ahayd maalin adag.
He thought he loved me.	Wuxuu mooday inuu i jecel yahay.
I need more.	Waxaan u baahanahay wax badan.
At first it was nothing.	Markii hore waxba ma ahayn.
No one was present.	Qofna meesha ma joogin.
There was really nothing good to say.	Runtii ma jirin wax wanaagsan oo uu sheego.
You can go anywhere you want.	Waxaad tagi kartaa meel kasta oo aad rabto.
Very hard to do.	Aad u adag in la sameeyo.
Don't have it, you don't need it.	Ha haysan, uma baahnid.
They should be on the job now.	Waa inay hadda shaqada ku jiraan.
I am very serious about this.	Aad ayaan uga dhab ahay arrintan.
I should not be here.	Waa inaan halkan joogin.
That could be better.	Taasi way fiicnaan kartaa.
I want to go home, he said to himself.	Waxaan rabaa inaan aado guriga, ayuu is yidhi.
Nowhere else.	Meel kale ma jirin.
This is often a lie.	Tani inta badan waa been.
We would do the same.	Waxaan sameyn lahayn sidaas oo kale.
There is something else he wants her to do.	Waxa jira wax kale oo uu doonayo in ay samayso.
I would not see him.	Maan arki lahayn isaga.
There is so much to say now.	Waxaa jira wax badan oo hadda la sheego.
This can be good for everyone.	Tani waxay noqon kartaa wax u wanaagsan qof walba.
I can't say anything.	Waxba kama hadli karo.
You should eat every day.	Waa in aad maalin kasta wax cunto.
He really does that.	Dhab ahaantii wuu sameeyaa taas.
I saw three of them.	Waxaan arkay saddex ka mid ah.
Do you know? 	Ma ogtahay?
But it was nothing else.	Laakiin wax kale ma ahayn.
Now she was busy.	Hadda waxay ahayd mashquul.
It must have been good.	Waa inay ahayd mid fiican.
He didn’t, really.	Ma uusan samayn, dhab ahaantii.
He thinks it is very beautiful.	Wuxuu u malaynayaa inay aad u qurux badan tahay.
It was a timeless moment.	Waxay ahayd wakhti aan wakhti lahayn.
This is true if.	Tani waa run haddii .
Everyone does.	Qof kastaa wuu sameeyaa.
He did not get it again.	Mar kale ma uu helin.
It took a lot.	Wuxuu u qaatay wax badan.
He told me not to.	Wuxuu ii sheegay inaanan sameyn.
As if it were true.	Sida haddii ay run ahayd.
This seems to be what he was trying to do.	Tani waxa uu u muuqdaa in uu isku dayay in uu sameeyo.
I am very sure.	Aad ayaan u hubaa.
Well done this one.	Si fiican ayaa loo sameeyay kan.
He looks like a good man.	Wuxuu u muuqdaa nin wanaagsan.
No one can help me in the best way.	Qofna ma ii caawin karaa sida ugu wanaagsan.
This is not surprising.	Tani ma aha wax la yaab leh.
In fact, he probably still does today.	Dhab ahaantii, malaha ilaa maanta wuu sameeyay.
I really do.	Runtii waan sameeyaa.
I thought he would find it interesting.	Waxaan u maleeyay inuu u heli doono mid xiiso leh.
It can happen now.	Way dhici kartaa hadda.
.	.
I wanted to say it was beautiful.	Waxaan rabay inaan sheego inay qurux badan tahay.
It is the smallest.	Waa kan ugu yar.
I would do anything for him.	Wax kasta waan u samayn lahaa isaga.
No one does.	Qofna ma sameeyo.
It will be everywhere, everything.	Waxay ahaan doontaa meel kasta, wax walba.
I have a job offer	Waxaan hayaa shaqo bixin
He took another.	Mid kale ayuu qaatay.
Not today.	Maanta maaha.
It would be unemployment.	Waxay ahaan lahayd shaqo la'aan.
But that should not be the case.	Laakiin taasi waa inaysan noqon.
I took that.	Waan soo qaatay taas.
Definitely not saying that.	Hubaal in aanu taas odhan.
Really good one.	Runtii mid wanaagsan.
I didn’t catch him.	Uma aan qaban isaga.
Tell an adult.	Qof weyn u sheeg.
Tomorrow will be a busy day.	Berrito waxay noqon doontaa maalin mashquul ah.
Otherwise he would say nothing.	Haddii kale waxba ma odhan jirin.
You will not believe me.	Ima rumaysan doonto.
I quickly withdrew.	Degdeg baan uga noqday.
Although there is one man she is very serious about.	In kasta oo uu jiro hal nin oo ay aad uga dhab tahay.
That is for sure.	Taasi waa hubaal.
But it cannot be done.	Laakiin lama samayn karo.
I thought everyone knew.	Waxaan u maleeyay in qof walba ogyahay.
It is a huge problem.	Waa dhibaato aad u weyn.
He lied.	Been buu sameeyay.
I can help you	Waan ku caawin karaa
I felt so much for you.	Aad baan kuu dareemay.
He made me love him.	Wuxuu iga dhigay inuu i jecel yahay.
And me.	Iyo aniga .
Couldn't go back.	Dib ugu noqon waayay.
You can believe everything.	Waad rumaysan kartaa wax walba.
I will, of course.	Waan sameyn doonaa, runtii.
Maybe that's right.	Malaha waa sax.
Everyone is happy.	Qof walba wuu faraxsan yahay.
You do not have to love everything.	Uma baahnid inaad wax walba jeceshahay.
She had to be able to.	Waxay ahayd inuu awoodo.
If we can be of any help.	Haddii aan wax caawin ah noqon karno .
You will get a job.	Waxaad heli doontaa shaqo.
I saw him with him.	waan kula arkay isaga.
It will not happen.	Ma dhici doono.
But I'm happy.	Laakiin waan ku faraxsanahay.
You love me.	Waad i jeceshahay.
I wouldn't have much time.	Waqti badan ma heli lahaa.
I can find something	wax waan heli karaa
No one came.	Cidna kama iman.
It’s not just what I am.	Kaliya maaha wax aan ahay.
To find out.	Si aad u ogaato.
He is at home now.	Wuu joogaa guriga hadda.
Which is equally likely.	Taas oo si isku mid ah ay u badan tahay.
Apparently he didn't even know he was there.	Waxaa cad inuusan xitaa ogeyn inuu halkaas joogo.
That's him.	Waa sidaas isaga.
Now you can do whatever you want here.	Hadda waxaad halkan ku samayn kartaa wax kasta oo aad rabto.
First you have to promise me.	Marka hore waa inaad ii ballan qaado.
He saw it every day.	Maalin walba wuu arki jiray.
It will be interesting.	Waxay noqon doontaa mid xiiso leh.
I have no money	Lacag ma haysto
I found it there	Waan ka helay halkaas
It must be said that it can be.	Waa in la sheego in ay noqon karto.
I never got it again.	Mar dambe ma helin.
I probably would have done better by that.	Waxa ay u badan tahay in aan si fiican u samayn lahaa sidaas.
She is so beautiful.	Aad bay u qurux badan tahay.
And beautiful.	Iyo mid qurux badan.
But, as always, they do.	Laakiin, sida had iyo jeer, way sameeyaan.
Now nothing more.	Hadda wax ka badan ma jiro.
Something left behind.	Wax qof ka tagay.
Unless they are.	Ilaa aanay ahayn.
That he would be fine.	In uu fiicnaan lahaa.
He still does today.	Weli maanta wuu sameeyaa.
I think we will get something.	Waxaan filayaa inaan wax heli doono.
He does.	Wuu sameeyaa.
They are good people.	Waa dadka wanaagsan.
You can get it if you want.	Waad heli kartaa haddii aad rabto.
Do you think so.	Ma u malaynaysaa .
But there is no time for this.	Laakiin ma jirto waqti tani.
We will see if that is the case.	Waan arki doonaa inay sidaas tahay.
A bit of this, a bit of that.	Xoogaa tan, xoogaa taas.
This should come as no surprise.	Tani waa in aan la yaab lahayn.
It wasn’t the people.	Ma ahayn dadka.
He was already at home.	Hore ayuu guriga ugu jiray.
I couldn't stop that.	Taas waan ku joojin waayay.
Now he had an idea.	Hadda fikrad buu lahaa.
You don't have to tell me.	Ma aha inaad ii sheegto.
Let me tell you how to do it.	Aan kuu sheego sida loo sameeyo.
He refused.	Wuu diiday.
I have a hard idea about that.	Waxaan qabaa fikrad adag taas.
Whatever you said.	Wax kasta oo aad sheegtay.
Certainly not.	Dhab ahaantii maaha.
Let's do it.	Aan samayno.
They love us.	Way na jecel yihiin.
Maybe a lot of things.	Waxaa laga yaabaa in waxyaabo badan.
That is not true.	Taasi run maaha.
I really felt great.	Runtii waxaan dareemay wax weyn.
Very good too.	Mid aad u fiican sidoo kale.
